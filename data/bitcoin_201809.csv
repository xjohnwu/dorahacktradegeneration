Anyone find it hard to connect with people who are brainwashed in the fiat world?,"I assume most people who invest in bitcoin invest a portion of their pay regularly eg 80% of their pay goes into buying bitcoin and the rest is just to keep alive ie food and shelter. 

For those who have been doing this for some time, they likely have a bit of wealth but at the same time they should not talk about this wealth because of risk of torture. Someone may torture the private keys out of you. 

So you cannot talk about bitcoin with friends, dates, etc. They will likely notice that you live frugally (because you're investing in bitcoin) and wonder why you're not putting your money into the regular debt slavery fiat system to eg buy a house. Likely they will assume you're just bad with money and waste it. 

As a low yield (or zero yield) asset and investment bitcoin disadvantages you in dating not because of any flaw in bitcoin but because most people are superficial.

It is highly likely that if you are investing in bitcoin you do so because you save up a large portion of your pay to buy the dips in bitcoin which means you appear frugal, but because bitcoin is high growth you'll likely be rich, but you cannot talk about it because of risk of torture, so your wealth is unknown and because most people are superficial you will be alone in life because they will judge you based on your leftover cash flow or tangible visible assets. If you are dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin you will have low leftover cash flow and zero visible assets.

Better understanding the fiat 'fanatics'.,"I just recently realized WHY I have such a heated debates with non crypto owners: we are talking about religion in a masked way. Fiat and all forms of money can only exist because we all trust in the value and to be more precise, the constant value over time.

I realized that the trust factor makes it for most people just as emotional as other 'believes' and money has a much bigger impact for everyone using it in everyday life than a religion has for most of the believers of such a religion (extremists aside...)

Said more bluntly ""most of the fiat users can be called FANATICS when it comes to the currency the use, even though it is forced upon them (stockholm syndrome anyone?).

The problem with fiat is that it is forced upon us and abused just that much that most can stand the pain (inflation, paying for bank services, taxes, etc).
We have sane alternatives, gold silver, but in the current economic landscape it is very cumbersome compared to fiat. 

But now there is BTC it has the usability of fiat without most of the downsides and it is as sane as PM.
We are on the gaining trust / adoption phase and it will be a hell of a fight if government will decide to fight it. 
But if BTC succeeds in becoming the global, reserve, currency we will look back at the 2018 top and just smile at the insignificantly of that top, just zoom out to all previous tops, they are hardly visible while at the time they happened they were just as breath taking as the last top.

But in telling most fiat users this you often find this religious 'wall'.
We are trying them to change their religion, and not just any religion but the one that is by default one of the most impacting aspect in their lives.

So the next time you spread our 'believe' please be aware how the other person might hear your argument, you are invading their beliefs.

Once you can step over your emotions and just rationally judge all factors most will be able to understand why BTC is a way better alternative, but remember most humans have a very hard time to do that as is painfully visible once you start discussing a belief with an average person.",1535793740,01/09/2018 09:22:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9c1s7c/better_understanding_the_fiat_fanatics/,1

Electrum seed generates two different bitcoin wallets,"I am using Electrum 3.3.2, I have the wallet file generated from Electrum and a password to decrypt the file. There is an error whenever I am trying to send Bitcoin out of that wallet, so I decide to create a new wallet with the same seed.

But with the same seed and same Electrum client version, the Bitcoin addresses in both wallets are completely different, and there is no balance in the newly create wallet.

I have tried to directly import the private key instead of seed to a new wallet, but I am getting a different Bitcoin address as well.

In case there is a solution for the error I mentioned before, here is the message I get:

I'm being persecuted for my sexual orientation in Chechnya,"Hello everyone my name is Venera I am 19 years old and I am a lesbian. Because of the oppression of sexual minorities in the place where I live, I'm in danger of being killed in the flesh. I live in a small town in the Republic of Chechnya which is Russia, this Republic is living according to the laws of the charade, and there is not a rare case when gays and lesbians were put in prison and then were never seen again. And I may soon suffer such a fate, because I have no money to leave this place. When my little town found out I was a lesbian, I was expelled from the College where I studied, and kicked out of work. I do not have my own home, so I could not pay for a rented apartment, and was left without means of subsistence. People stopped talking to me, and it's very moral pressure. Me temporarily sheltered sister and the in secret from husband, I live in the basement their homes and get out on streets only at night, when all sleep. In General, I am persecuted for my sexual orientation, which is very stupid in the civilized world. I see a way only to apply for political asylum in the United States, but I do not even have the money to travel to Moscow for registration of the necessary documents. If I had the money I would go to Mexico, Russia and Mexico visa-free regime. And then from Mexico near the border with the United States asked for political asylum, I know so did before me. Forgive all not indifferent to help financially escape and save my life, I'm really in danger.

Was the rally to 8.5k the last ‘fools rally’?,"I am on the sidelines here, I know the potential of decentralised currency is what the world needs right now, but am realistic enough to know how a market cycle works.

There are considerable vested interests at play here right now, miners and exchanges certainly don’t want the price to fall below established support (5.8k - 6k).

There are whales that want a lower price, but are struggling to attain it and retail investors won’t buy until they feel sure of a good thing.

In my opinion, institutional investors are either already playing with the whales or are hoping to jump in before they miss the next rally. Most institutions can’t jump in due to lack of regulation, but the ones that are serious have worked out, by now, how to do it.

If you look at alt coins price action, it would be reasonable to assume that capitulation has already happened and the bottom is in. This is evident in that the BTC price has not dropped to $5k or in to the $4k’s. This is not to say it can’t happen, but alt coins have certainly born the brunt of this bear market.

I would like to hear others opinion about if the consolidation in price is starting now and if you truely believe a rally into the end of the year is still possible. 

From what I experienced last year, my first year in crypto stated in July 2017, this dip could be the precursor to another rally - like the ones before. On the other hand the consolidation could drag on and either sideways or lower is on there cards.

Safe trading to all, it’s still early days as far as I can tell. Wishing financial independence and security to all.

I printed out month by month charts for every year since 2013 and noticed some basic trends. 

For instance I noticed nearly every year right ~March 18th the price hit a low before rising. I sold a week before March 18th and then bought again when It seemed like It hit a low enough price. I’ve seen this correlation with other dates too, but I was trying to find a chart that better depicts this combined and overlaid instead of taping 12 sheets of paper together for each month, stacking them by year, and comparing the drops and peaks accordingly.

where people do not know what fiat money is and have never used it. 

Now YOU invented fiat money. how would you convince the people to use it?

I like the idea of imagening that new technology is the standard in order to understand if it has a chance to be fully adopte. Also it helps me to get some clarity if the status quo will look really stupid from a future perspective.

r/Bitcoin recap - August 2018,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I’m back with the twentieth monthly Bitcoin news recap.


For those unfamiliar, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in bitcoin over the past month.


You can see recaps of the previous months on [Bitcoinsnippets.com](http://bitcoinsnippets.com/)

Coinbase issue unresolved,"I recently bought some crypto on Coinbase and have been trying to transfer it to my hard wallet to no avail. The error message I’m getting reads “the transaction fee has expired”. I called Coinbase and they claim it’s a “timing bug” that’s causing this error message and that they are working to resolve it. Through some digging online, however, it seems as though this issue has been going on for months. Coinbase gave me a case number and told me they’d reach out once the issue is resolved. 

In the event of a Coinbase hack, would the crypto in my account held on the exchange be at risk? It’s a semi-rhetorical question because everything I’ve researched says yes. However, Coinbase claims that it is impossible to hack into their system!! I’m thoroughly angry and simply want to move my crypto to a hard wallet.

Coinspot selling price difference,If i am selling any coin in Coinspot it reduces the price further and then i pay commission on top of that. So it means you commission isnt reduced to 1% because if i calculate reduced price while selling and 1% commission on top of that i am actually paying 1.5 percent or more. Selling price should not change if you click on sell coin. For ex sell price of any coin is $2.95 and when you actually want to sell that coin it reduces to $2.87 for ex and then commission paid on top of it. Isnt that a cheating to consumers?

Recommended approach for donations,"Hi r/Bitcoin,
  I came across this man: https://youtu.be/SBJ-Bzs2bXc doing amazing work running a dog/cat shelter in Greece and noticed he is only accepting donations via PayPal.  This weekend, I messaged him and recommended he consider accepting Bitcoin.  I gave him a very very high level overview and sent him a few links about why Bitcoin can be great for receiving donations.  He seems somewhat interested, but I anticipate that he may not be the most technically savy. 

What would be the easiest, recommended approach for me to point him to or walk him through getting set up to receive donations?  I'm aware Coinbase exists in Greece, so he can use that to exchange his donations to the Euro to purchase supplies, but which wallet should I recommend?  Are there any blog posts, videos, or tutorials that you recommend I send him in the case that he becomes skeptical?

**PSA: The Scaling Debate is over.** At the Berlin Lightning Hackday this weekend some #reckless people implemented a POS solution on mobile devices that allows us to accept Bitcoin via the lightning network at our bar (ROOM77).,"https://twitter.com/renepickhardt/status/1036032671397437446?s=19

Stuff just got real. Real as in applied in a real world business in a real world usecase recklesly using real money.

People opened channels to our node and paid and other people did not open channels to us but their payments were successfully routed and arrived in literally microseconds as well anyway.

I am herewith declaring the end of the scaling debate. This problem is solved. We can now refocus on the actual challenges like fungability and privacy in Bitcoin. 

I wanna throw out the biggest thanks to Rene and all the other guys who I cannot possibly name who have contributed. Also to Jef, Christian and Josh of fulmo who did an unbelievable job bringing the people together here and making this development possible.

This kind of innovation feels like the early days of Bitcoin all over again.

I made a bet for 600 euro worth of bitcoin,"As the title suggests I made a bet where 600 euro worth of bitcoin can be won. The deal was that I have to put 300 in and my friend Ryan has to put 300 euro in. You may now be wondering what exactly I made a bet on, and it’s rather simple. Get 1000 subscribers on YouTube without any videos whatsoever. 

Now, I know most people will just read this and go meh. But honestly for the few subscribers I got out of nowhere after doing a bit of promoting I feel like I might not have actually lost my 300 euro. 

So I ask kindly, as a guy who made a difficult bet. Please give it a subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuodfcFgFeIjgcJjKwBzt0Q

Very serious deposit problem with Coinbase Pro," I am a professional trader and already made hundreds of deposits to my Coinbase Pro Account. What happened here is very serious imo as a bug like this could have easily resulted in a severe financial loss.

​

On September 1st I deposited 200 LTC to my Coinbase Pro account. The Deposit appears right in the list of successful LTC Deposits. There is just one problem: the 200 LTC's were never added to my balance. It's also missing in my statement.

​

That something like this can happen at a supposedly professional exchange is very worrying. Please check your statement, guys. I am sure I am not the only one.....

$1B Bitcoins On The Move: Owner Transfers ~$100M to Bitfinex And Binance In 10 Days,"This is the third post of a series of articles dedicated to investigate $1B worth of bitcoins (111,114 BTC/BCH/... BXX) that were dormant since 2014 and started moving actively. The BTC coins were originally located at this address ([1KyJr2L6CN5XhDfv9Sb5q3kjKwFCrRxTLy](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1KyJr2L6CN5XhDfv9Sb5q3kjKwFCrRxTLy)). 

The origin of the bitcoins is discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/).

A deep-dive into the wallet activity was discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bwsaf/investigating_the_1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_from_a/).

Today, I will focus on the transfer to major exchanges wallets that could indicate that the owner is selling his coins or exchanging it with alts or mixing it to cover his back.

I built a graph in order to deep dive into the transactions originated from the 111,114-BTC wallet and followed it. This is the resulting graph were red indicates transactions &lt;1d, yellow &lt;1month, blue &lt;1 year.

https://i.redd.it/nk3iov045vj11.png

&amp;#x200B;

I found that at least 15,593 BTC originated from the 111,114-BTC wallet have been moved to Bitfinex and Binance wallets. This represents 14% of the original funds and more that $110M.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitfinex wallet**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/m8fryy8s5vj11.png

&amp;#x200B;

11,114 BTC have been transferred to Bitfinex wallet [1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g) and the majority of these coins have been transferred in the last 7 days (August 24th - September 2nd).

Here is the list of the transactions:

https://i.redd.it/8e9l0lqf0vj11.png

&amp;#x200B;

**Binance wallet**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/i1v5lv3j9vj11.png

&amp;#x200B;

4,421 BTC have been transferred to Binance wallet [1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s) and the majority of these coins have been transferred in the last 10 days (August 21st - September 2nd).

Here is the list of the transactions:

https://i.redd.it/2cs6ufabavj11.png

T.B.C.

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly BTC price is pumping since those funds were starting to be transferred to Bitfinex and Binance wallets (see Binance transactions' list, August 11th)

Hard drive failure after opening 7 LN channels in Eclair,"So less than 24 hours after setting up a full BTC node and Eclair LN node with 6 payment channels (and a 7th opened with be by someone else) I have a HDD failure. I have extra drives and so I installed Windows on another one and am in the process of trying to salvage files from bad drive but it may not work.

Anyway 2 questions: Assuming eclair on win10, what specific folders/files should I be targeting, since its looking like a full copy isn't going to be possible, if anything at all.

Question #2: I don't fully understand the current punishment method in LN but am I better off not doing anything (will opened channels eventually time out and return my funds) or should I be attempting a restore somehow? I know LN is beta and I didnt put in more than I can comfortably lose, but I put in well more than enough to care...

Basic economics of incentive to spend,"I talked with someone yesterday who brought up a good point. With a deflationary asset, the incentive is to hold and accumulate.

The flip side of this is, the incentive becomes not to spend it.

How is this rectified with Bitcoin, such to incentivize spending? I'm speaking in very basic terms.

Also, my friend brought up that with inflationary fiat money, the incentive is to spend while it still has value. I thought this was a great point.

Acquiring a little BTC...( .3 BTC) can be problematic! even when offering an 8% fee,".Just trying to get a little BTC for my son as a gift!  TIME IS IMPORTANT!  I'll list the avenues attempted where one problem or another made the acquisition impossible..

&amp;#x200B;

Even with KYC nonsense agreed to, -- and I'm not sure I like sharing so much info with people and organizations who, **despite what they claim**, can share that info with others,  I have still had still had problems.  If someone wants to jump in and message me about helping solve this problem, feel free to do so.

*  Coinbase, --for new accounts, using a credit or debit card only agree to   
$100 a week in BTC Purchase.  This after providing them with bank account info and Drivers license
* Coinmama won't sell to me because of the state I live in.
* Kraken (who I have an account with through Glidedra)  will only sell using banki account payment (but delivery won't  be until the 9th of Sept).
* Cexio will only start with something like $400 for a Card purchase (which gets instant delivery. --or is this another one that doesn't deal with people in my state.
* Hodl Hodl.  still wants to greatly limit the transaction amount to a couple of hundred bucks.
* Bisq.  Also wants to limit the initial transaction to around $400.. Even with my setting up ""Zelle"" through a Wells fargo  account.

Wow what  Pain in the \_\_\_.  BTW...**I am aware that these are the ""wild West"" days of crypto and have not only heard many horror stories, but have been personally scammed out a of a sizable coin transfer supposedly through Shape-shift that was ""scraped?"" by a crooked company impersonating them and using a google allowed first position ad for Shapeshift.**

The only person more dependably wrong than Tom Lee is the redditor Cryptogrip.,"Tom Lee said BTC would hit $100K in 2018 after seeing it hit $20K in 2017. Then, after the nasty crash in February, he digressed and said it will definitely hit $50K. Then a few more months of stagnancy and minor bulls runs in May, he said BTC is sure to hit $25K by October 2018. Now, it’s September 3rd and he’s claiming $20K by the end of the year. Give it a month or two more of dryness and he’ll reduce his estimate down to $10K followed by $8K. Tom Lee is the king of being wrong. The only person more wrong than him is the mediocre redditor troll known as cryptogrip. These dependably wrong people are like the Jim Cramer of BTC. If you want to be broke, stay listening to these fools.

LEOOY: Accelerating the development of the tourism industry with blockchain as the medium,"With the enthusiasm of “Technology Era + Essays Era”, LEOOY is the first to introduce blockchain technology into the travel industry and develop blockchain tourism.

In the new information technology era, the text travel industry has stood at the fork of humanities and technology. Artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing have all entered the travel industry. The blockchain travel platform headed by LEOOY will begin to Blockchain technology is used in tourism. The development of the travel industry and the development of scientific and technological forces must complement each other. How can the modern travel industry break through the boundaries of form and industry and usher in new peaks?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ktpgtba5xzj11.png

The bottleneck of technology companies is low conversion rate, and the bottleneck of the tourism industry is low industrial efficiency. Technology brings time to the imagination of tourism, and tourism brings space to imagination. The OTA platform is the most widely used in the travel industry. It can even be said to be a monopoly. Tourism is ultimately an industry, not a sentiment, how to industrialize and standardize, and turn it into a liquidity. The scale of the commercial body, the power of new technology is still very important.

A typical problem encountered by the tourism industry is that consumers and markets rely on traditional OTA platforms for transportation and hotel bookings and transactions. But with the increase in usage, the drawbacks have made many consumers miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/331jpdm6xzj11.png

Consumer price issues, market service providers' cost issues, and various reports of deceiving consumers for marketing purposes are also emerging. The problem for consumers is that the quality of service providers is not in place, the prices of scenic spots and transportation are too expensive, and the implicit terms of the platform are too ""pit people."" The problem with enterprise service providers is that the platform is too expensive, resulting in large cost and inability to match the consumer quality at the same price, resulting in low corporate reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1q0runz7xzj11.jpg

The development of a service-oriented industry, consumers and enterprises are the mainstays, the new blockchain technology has the characteristics of “decentralization”, and the third-party intermediary platform is removed. Tourist service providers can directly connect with tourists, and visitors can pass the blockchain. The technology-based blockchain travel platform can query the scenic spot online, book hotels, etc. The information in all blocks can not be falsified, open and transparent to ensure the authenticity of the information. Real-time settlement through point-to-point smart contract, saving the cost of service providers, reducing consumer prices and ensuring the interests of consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/c68z7459xzj11.jpg

The tourism industry is a service-oriented industry. Enterprise service providers and consumers are the two main players. The occurrence of each bottleneck is due to the contradiction between these two main bodies, which leads to the development of smoothness. Therefore, in order to accelerate the development of the tourism industry, It is to develop new information technology forces to balance and resolve the contradiction between the two.

When tourism service providers pay more attention to the quality of service provided, and tourism consumers are not entangled in some problems of cost and experience, tourism consumers will pay attention to the meaning of culture and tourism, and will be more willing to participate, and blockchain tourism. The technical characteristics can be said to be a timely rain. Its emergence must be strong and powerful for the development of the accelerated text travel industry.

Paying to Bitpay without Payment Protocol,"Hello everyone, 
I recently found a lot of people struggling to use Bitpay's Payment Protocol implementation. It was a while since they announced it and there were some solutions (decoders). But the problem with them is that they can just show you the wrong address/amount and there is no way for you to verify it.

I'm going to show you how to get the address/amount yourself. 

Its quite simple. When you get payment getway, you need to get the link from there. 
Then you need to send a GET request to that link with header: ""Accept"" and value ""application/payment-request"" 
You will get JSON response with the address and amount required to pay. Now, not everyone is in tech business and knows how to do that. 
You will need a free tool called Postman. Download it and from there it should be straightforward.  

Example: https://i.imgur.com/Qoy71hJ.png

Not a lot of wallets support BIP 70 yet, and I don't see why should anyone whose wallet don't support that switch to another one just to make payments to Bitpay. 
Hope I've helped someone out :) ",1535976460,03/09/2018 12:07:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ckyfi/paying_to_bitpay_without_payment_protocol/,1

Daex - The clear solution,"The clearing chain is the core of the DAEX clearing ecosystem. It provides clearing and settlement services to both individual and institution users. It is an open sourced cryptocurrency clearing solution based on distributed ledger technology. This chain is deployed on multiple nodes on a public cloud. It uses one kind of POS consensus mechanism to validate transactions. 

\-   Clearing Contract 

All clearing and settlement business rules are preprogrammed into this clearing contract. This smart contract finishes the whole clearing and settlement cycle of a matched trade. After a matched trade is formed in a DAEX participating exchange, it is sent to the clearing chain. A clearing smart contract is then formed for this matched trade. This clearing smart contract will first validate the matched trade to make sure that it meets all the business requirements. 

\-   The Clearing Mechanism 

Everyone participate clearing mechanism provides an effective way for DAEX wallet users to obtain real financial reward. At the same time, the clearing responsibility mechanism can identify a process that leads to mistakes in consensus, and perform punishments according clearing rules. In the classic POS mechanism, the weight of every node is linked to the capital on this node. This can lead to Matthew Effect which makes the rich richer. In the DAEX clearing ecosystem, every DAEX wallet user has equal accounting power but different accounting scores. The accounting power is determined by the ecosystem, it acquires specific number of accounting scores through value factor evaluation and exchange. Those nodes with a certain number of accounting scores can be defined as a validator. Validator on the clearing chain is similar to miner. Wallet users can select a validator to delegate their accounting scores

\- The  Clearing Account 

All DAEX participating exchanges use one clearing ledger, customer accounts are created and managed on the same ledger. Customers’ trading assets are also managed on the same ledger. The same underlying technology and clearing rules significantly reduce exchanges’ costs and errors. The technology, as well as the business rules DAEX uses, are open and transparent to exchanges and traders. The DAEX clearing chain will accommodate the existing infrastructure of exchanges. Adapters that make sure the matched trade meets the DAEX clearing protocol will be provided to exchanges to facilitate their adoption of DAEX service. End users can use wallets that meet the DAEX specification to access and manage their trading assets on the clearing chain. The DAEX clearing service is different from existing clearing services.

"Immigrant, Maximalist, VC, Mom and my 2¢","The only thing freedom directly translates to is not being a slave. By definition, slavery is being fundamentally effected by the choices, decision and whims of others. Fiat is the technology that has enabled that to the greatest extent throughout history, these are discussions I am seeing in VC circle on daily basis amongst people who finally see it. If you are effected by government decision which materially alter your wealth, you are subservient to them.

1 Bitcoin will always equal 1 Bitcoin, but 1Fiat won't ever equal only equal 1Fiat. Government can unilaterally impose policy which literally steals from the poor to give to the rich. There is a cognisant dissonance from within VC because they missed out, they are not retroactively trying to apply pattern recognition to fund the next Bitcoin. The problem is that there isn't, and instead they are funding ShitCoins and enabling a new generation of founders who conform to their bullshit expectations. At their core they lack the empathy required to be contrarian, which leads them to protect their own ego's and inadequacy by claiming they are. That's why they are all reading the Sovereign Individual together. Literally in Telegram groups discussing the salient points.

Money evolved as the mechanism to enable the continued existence of slavery. Happy for anyone to dispute that. What originated in the form of trade was the human body as payment for certain things, what replaced it was the value of those people in coin. Where we couldn't put a price on people individually due to uniqueness, we stripped away that and made slaves who were uniformly valued. This is where money grew from.

The reason banks dispute the innovation is because they recognize their juxtaposition against it's success. It's hard to support the model that will cannibalize your monopoly, just as Kodak. Furthermore, when they do support 'blockchain' iniatives more broadly all they do is enable individuals to understand their market outside the shackles of these prehistoric institututions. They learn enough to revolutionise the system externally, Amber Baldet the most recent example (who is awesome by the way).

Want to know how deep this goes? I received an email from one of the most prominent 'CryptoBillionaires' yesterday. I had a contact looking for a large volume of Bitcoin to purchase OTC. His suggestion was I use GDAX... my reply laid out the reasons why it was critical to purchase OTC, without highlighting why I couldn't, where he tried to mansplain the reason I should use an exchange CC'ing in founder of another prominent exchange. 

Anyway, just a few thoughts. Maybe Crypto isn't the answer, but in a world where the leaders of the free world dispute the worthiness of their own intelligence services I'd be inclined to hedge with an alternative. If you can own a Bitcoin buy one because it could be your token to freedom sooner than you think.

""I have the latest graph with different colours so my prediction is going to be accurate...""   All of that wild speculation is nothing more than pump and dumps. 

If  you remove all wishful thinking what is left is an experiment that has not made significant progress in terms of it's market adoption since it's infancy. Almost nothing is sold using bitcoin, a few services accept bitcoin but it's negligible. Most of  the transaction you guys see on  blockchain explorers are just the result of  unhealthy speculation.

I have faith in Bitcoin.,"Bitcoin works.  Bitcoin is strong and growing.

What are some of the alternatives to Bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep using fiat?**  No, thanks.  Fiat money always ends up being worthless.  History teaches us this same lesson, many times.  Fiat is but one step along the road to ruin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Go back to the gold standard?**  This could work, but it's not likely to happen, as central banks have hoarded most of the gold.  Funny how when central bank hold many **thousands of tons of gold**, but they expect the rest of us to remain ignorant and cling to their fiat ""play money"" which they create from thin air in order to rob us.  The gold standard could still work, but it isn't likely to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alt coins?**  Nope.  S. Ammous has a section in chapter 10 of his book, ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" where he explains why alt-coins are not the answer.  In part:

&gt;While it is common to think that these currencies exist in competition with Bitcoin, and that one of them might overtake Bitcoin in the future, in reality they are not in competition with Bitcoin because they can never have the properties that make Bitcoin functional as digital cash and sound money. In order for a digital system to function as digital cash, it has to be outside the control of any third party; its operation needs to conform to the will of its user according to the protocol, with no possibility for any third party to stop these payments. After years of watching altcoins get created, it seems impossible that any coin will recreate the adversarial standoff that exists between Bitcoin stakeholders and prevents any party from controlling payments in it.  
&gt;  
&gt;. . .  
&gt;  
&gt;...virtually all altcoins have a team in charge; they began the project, marketed it, designed the marketing material, and plugged press releases into the press as if they were news items, while also having the advantage of mining a large number of coins early before anybody had heard of the coins. These teams are publicly known individuals, and no matter how hard they might try, they cannot demonstrate credibly that they have no control over the direction of the currency, which undermines any claims other currencies might have to being a form of digital cash that cannot be edited or controlled by any third party.

Privacy features coming to Bitcoin 0.17.0,"I like to track the privacy status of coins, especially bitcoin.  Looking through the [current version of the 0.17.0 release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.17.0-Release-notes)([Archive](https://archive.is/iVpAK)) got me pretty excited as there are some real gems in this release:

&gt; **Coin selection**
&gt; **Partial spend avoidance**
&gt; When an address is paid multiple times the coins from those separate payments can be spent separately which hurts privacy due to linking otherwise separate addresses. A new -avoidpartialspends flag has been added (default=false). If enabled, the wallet will always spend existing UTXO to the same address together even if it results in higher fees. If someone were to send coins to an address after it was used, those coins will still be included in future coin selections.

BIP174 has been added which will help wallet developers implement CoinJoin a lot easier:
&gt; 
&gt; **BIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions support**
&gt; 
&gt; BIP 174 PSBT is an interchange format for Bitcoin transactions that are not fully signed yet, together with relevant metadata to help entities work towards signing it. It is intended to simplify workflows where multiple parties need to cooperate to produce a transaction. Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and **CoinJoin transactions.*
&gt; 
&gt; Overall workflow
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the following steps:
&gt; 
&gt;     A Creator proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs a PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.
&gt;     For each input, an Updater adds information about the UTXOs being spent by the transaction to the PSBT.
&gt;     A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys involved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.
&gt;     Signers inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they agree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs to assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a partial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).
&gt;     A Finalizer is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and possibly script information into a final scriptSig and/or scriptWitness.
&gt;     An Extractor produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format) from a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply add more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have to operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the Extractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel operation, Combiners can be employed which merge metadata from different PSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.
&gt; 
&gt; The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They're useful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and hardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.

Also sure to be of note to anyone who actually uses bitcoind for a business, though not specifically privacy related, bitcoind now features:
&gt; **Dynamic loading and creation of wallets**

Is that true that the smaller the country - the less stupid its government's reaction on Bitcoin is?," After more than a year of closely monitoring world's government's answers to rising Bitcoin popularity I might state that, although there are a number of notable exceptions to this rule (mostly among Middle Eastern as well as some Central American and Asian countries), the bigger a country - the duller and, often, crueler its rulers' retort to Bitcoin is. Understandably so, isn't it? In the dog-eats-dog business of people's governance, the more you are threaten - the more aggressive you behave. Here's an example of the former USSR republic (now a small, independent nation) - Moldova. 

In a period of about a year [the National Bank of Moldova](https://www.bnm.md/en) (NBM) has managed to publish three communiques on Bitcoin. This fact is already very telling about the officially perceived level of Bitcoin's popularity in this small (4 million inhabitants, 132nd place in the world) East-European nation. However, NBM still keeps its bad central banking instincts in check and reacts to Bitcoin right with accordance to country's size, which, basically, means that NBM tries to not meddle with that new, unknown, dangerously unpredictable but, who knows, may be even beneficial for country's overall performance, form of money.

In its press release, dated back to July 10, 2017 NBM's said: [*""The use of (Bitcoin) is not regulated in the Republic of Moldova. They do not represent a form of electronic money within the meaning of the Law on payment services and electronic money no.114 of 18 May 2012 and the activity on their issuance and transaction is not subject to the competent authority’s supervision.""*](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/virtual-currency-and-its-associated-risks)

Those of you, who are (even vaguely) familiar with the unnatural language with which national bankers habitually express themselves, might notice that this statement is unusual in the way it unapologetically sates the unregulated status of Bitcoin in Moldova.

Even after it was recognized that [*""Moldova’s own separatist region, the unrecognized republic of Transnistria, has adopted (Bitcoin) friendly legislation that legalizes mining and provides incentives for foreign investors in the sector.""*](https://news.bitcoin.com/moldova-with-new-crypto-exchange-and-a-token/) NBM's position remains unperturbed, which was reconfirmed by bank's officials in their two most recent dispatches - that of February and May of 2018 expressively named [The National Bank of Moldova repeatedly warns about the risks associated with investing in (Bitcoin)](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/national-bank-moldova-repeatedly-warns-about-risks-associated-investing-so-called) ... "" and ""[The National Bank of Moldova warns about high risks of investing in ](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/national-bank-moldova-warns-about-high-risks-investing-cryptocurrencies).. (Bitcoin)"".

Essentially, those are fundamentally good news for Moldavian Bictoin-holders for it, most probably, means, that their local power-wielders have decided to adapt wait-and-see approach toward Bitcoin in order to buy more times for themselves and built a system which will be able in a future to shake a Bitcoin fruits tree rather than to cut if off.

Business Notes for Bitcoin Startups Founders:

* political climate: relatively friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: locally;
* industries to focus: e-commerce, e-jobs, marketplaces, FinTech;
* major limitations: excessive regulations, high taxes, low wages, governments control, absence of seed and VC financing, brain drainage, low-tech, agriculture orientated economy;
* stimulus: very high GDP growth rate (over 30%), low costs, little competition;
* opportunities: to bootstrap on local niche markets.
* Bitcoin (outlook): not regulated (positive) .

Bitcoin wallet withdraws 'unhackable' claim,""" **Bitfi, a cryptocurrency wallet backed by anti-virus software entrepreneur John McAfee, has issued a statement saying it will no longer describe its service as ""unhackable"".**

The announcement followed the release of evidence by a group of security researchers showing the wallet being compromised.

However, Mr McAfee maintains that the claim stands.

Bitfi had offered a $250,000 (£190,000) reward to anyone who hacked the wallet.

But it stated that the Bitcoin inside must be removed from the wallet - which was controversial among the cybersecurity community as often weaknesses are identified but not acted upon.

The group claimed to have hacked the wallet once before but Bitfi and Mr McAfee refused to accept their evidence.

What do you think about the Blockchain voting system in Japan?," A new online voting system based on the My Number identification system and blockchain technology has been introduced in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture.

The new system has not been without its hiccups, however. Many voters could not remember the passwords, and it was difficult to ascertain whether votes had been counted.

Blockchain advocates however, will note that the problems experienced by voters had little to do with the blockhain tech per se - and were issues more to do with the use of any kind of digital voting interface.

​

Seems that Japan is leading a blockchain-based democracy in the world... Or is it a negative signal of social development?

​

What do you think?

Bip47 is a wombo combo with OpenCAP,"Bip47 allows a payment reciever to send a reusable code to a sender that allows the sender to privately create a new address to send Bitcoin on-chain.

OpenCAP is a protocol that allows a reciever to associate an address (or payment code :) with a human readable alias, like mine: ""donate$ogdolo.com"". 

Combined these improvements allow users to send and receive transactions privately while also allowing wallets to offer a ""cash app"" experience. We can have human readable contact lists in out wallets!

For more info check out the GitHub:
https://GitHub.com/OpenCAP/protocol

Or a free to use implementation:
https://ogdolo.com

We still needs wallets to integrate with the OpenCAP protocol, if you have a favorite wallet let them know. I'm not a wallet dev, I'm a backend guy, but I would be willing to assist with any integrations.

Tell me again why is a bad idea to try and time the market,"Seems it would be so easy to take advantage of Bitcoin's high volatility to make a 1% profit every couple of days. If I bet a large enough sum it could add up to a nice passive income. Or, alternatively, catch a 10% fluctuation and it's pretty obvious when they come if you look at the patterns, even without knowing about indicators.

A 1% fluctuation is so common that it's practically foolproof. What are the odds of me getting into the position and bitcoin never dropping 1% below that price, ever? Practically nothing? The only reason I can think of people not doing it is not having enough capital to make significant gains on such small profit margins.

Privacy and Bitcoin,"Sharing the content of the infographic from [https://www.bitcoindesigned.com/infographics/privacy-and-bitcoin/](https://www.bitcoindesigned.com/infographics/privacy-and-bitcoin/) where it was originally posted.

​

**1. Personal risk**

If everyone knows how much money you have, criminals can decide that you are a worthy target to be attacked for your money.

If you are lucky, the attack will only be digital but, in many known cases, it gets physical as well.

This puts you and your loved ones at great risk.

​

**2. Targeted ads**

If your finances are easily followed and, let's say, sold to advertising agencies that show you ads based on your spendings, other people besides yourself might end up seeing these ads and learning what you are buying.

Even with legal harmless stuff, it might be a liking or a need that you'd prefer to keep private.

There's actually a real life example of a father learning his daughter was pregnant because of the ads that were directed to her.

​

**3. Business privacy**

For a business, having your finances transparent and available to anyone can cause serious damage.

Imagine if your competitors knew all about your revenues, margins, suppliers, the salaries of your employers, etc.

​

**4. Commercial leverage**

What if a company knew that you had a lot of money and wouldn't hurt you to pay three times the price they usually charge on a product?

They could easily show ""special prices"" for you on their e-commerce website based on how much they think you're going to pay.

​

**5. Miner censorship**

If your address is easily found and connected to you, miners can join forces to censor your transactions by actively not adding it to their proposed block.

Why would they do that? For numerous reasons, including government pressure, business interest or just wanting to see the world burn.

​

**6. Fungibility**

Good money has to be fungible, that is, all ""chunks"" of money have to be equally accepted no matter its origin.

That is the reality with cash. No one can refuse your cash or try to prosecute you just because the person who paid you got the money selling drugs.

If it weren't fungible, every bill would effectively be worth a different value (dirty notes would be worth less than clean ones) and the money wouldn't work.",1536045276,04/09/2018 07:14:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ctch4/privacy_and_bitcoin/,1

We need a subreddit where we can discuss legal issues concerning bitcoin and crypto in general! So I created it.,"In my opinion a place where we can discuss and bring together all interesting legal opinions/documents/research on crypto and blockchain would be a great addition to bitcoin and crypto in general. Instead of the price discussion and shills dominating once interesting subreddits like /r/CryptoCurrency, we should have a place to discuss the future of crypto in a normal way.

I am looking forward to discuss questions like:  Is the future of blockchain in the EU in jeopardy with GDPR being in force? Does the cryptospace need regulation to be able to move forward? What is the legal status of smart contracts? How should cryptocurrencies be taxed?

And I hope that reddit.com/r/cryptolegal will be a perfect place for that!",1536049118,04/09/2018 08:18:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ctoxr/we_need_a_subreddit_where_we_can_discuss_legal/,1

Casa Lightning Node and Lightning Ramp,"Hey Reddit!  


Greetings from Michael and Tom of the Lightning Ramp team! We've been working on a new project and are happy to announce the Casa Lightning Node today!  
The tools available to run a Lightning node today aren't sufficient to enable mass adoption. They require significant technical knowledge, aren't user friendly, or just plain don't work.

This is a problem. The Lightning network's utility increases as the number of people using the network grows. It will never achieve true utility without more approachable end-user products.

To help solve this, we've turned what started as an internal hobby project into a full product: the Casa Lightning Node. It's a plug-and-play device that runs a full Bitcoin and Lightning node at the same time. Our team focused intensely on UI/UX design while building the node software. We firmly believe this is the easiest way on the market to access the Lightning Network.  
There's limited availability, so jump on it if you're interested! You can pre-order at,  
[https://store.casa](https://store.casa/lightning-node/) (Credit Card or Bitcoin)

HMRC Capital Gains Tax - Negligible Value Claim,"Scenario: You sold an altcoin for USD to then buy Bitcoin. Your capital gains exceeded your allowance, and therefore liable for tax.

You have not sold your Bitcoin and therefore have not crystallised a loss, however because the market essentially crashed the latter half of the tax year, and therefore any gains you made are essentially worthless, would this warrant submitting a Negligible Value Claim of your Bitcoin to offset against your gains? 

Kinda feel I’m grasping at straws here however would be interesting to see others views on this.

Bitcoin and taxing in Colombia,"Hello everyone. I live in Colombia and want to set up my business so people can pay with bitcoin. 

I've found that Colombia doesn't recognize bitcoin as a currency,its basically alegal, they don't have a law for it. How would this work with taxation, will there be no taxation? Can I just cash out my bitcoin to my bank account using coinbase or gdax? I know that in a lot of countries you have to provide trade/transaction history, sales records etc. 

I'd love to hear some experiences from people in unregulated countries, how do you deal with taxation and receiving payments, what systems do you use etc. Any help is welcome and well appreciated!

WeSellCrypto is back!,"Hi all - Some of you may have used our service previously to purchase Bitcoin &amp; other altcoins via PayPal.

Unfortunately PayPal has not changed its stance regarding sale of cryptocurrency, but we have partnered up a payment processor to accept 3D-Secure credit cards in many regions (currently excl. US, Canada, Japan, China-- full list can be found on our website - www.wesellcrypto.com).

We offer simple verification requirements (simply email with some basic info (name, country, etc.) for purchasing up to $15 per day.  Larger limits do require ID verification, approved within 24 hours.  Once approved, you can purchase any time going forward.

Some benefits to our service:

- We do not store your coins.  Immediately following purchase completion, coins are delivered to the address you specify

- We do not see your card information.  During checkout, you are sent to our fully PCI compliant payment processor to complete payment.

- While we do operate at a percentage markup (15%), we are priced to undercut competition on Paxful, LBC, etc. &amp; offer 24/7 availability with instant delivery (no opening a buy, communicating with seller, etc.)

I would argue we have one of the best reputations for non-traditional purchasing.  Feel free to research around various subreddits (dogecoin, particularly) and find testaments to our consistent service for three years up until our downtime from last June.

Right now we're only seeing 1-2% of the transaction volume we previously had via PayPal but are hoping to see continued growth so we can return to at least our break-even point and continue offering our service.

If our use case meets some of your needs, I hope you will check us out.  Happy to answer any questions.",1536075372,04/09/2018 15:36:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9cwpxg/wesellcrypto_is_back/,1

5000€ stolen by hackers because of one simple tiny mistake | BE AWARE!,"Hi dear Subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently am in a very bad place, because most, if not all, of my savings got stolen - I have been mugged, there is no other way to put it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still trying to figure out what has happened, however I think I got the hang of it. Despite my time in crypto and my general awareness of security flaws, I have made one big mistake.

My funds were mostly saved on a Ledger Nano S and some on my Exodus wallet (for mining, buying stuff, donating etc.).

It is crucial to understand that I have bought my Ledger and created the Exodus wallet in the first months of me getting into Crypto, and therein lies the mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though you should NEVER DO THIS, I saved the keywords on my harddrive. I encrypted them with a password and saved them in a protected folder, but I must have forgotten to delete the raw txt files with the keywords on it (as said, one small mistake).

&amp;#x200B;

On Aug 31st both of my accounts (BTC &amp; ETH on Exodus and BTC &amp; XRP on Ledger) got emptied in a matter of seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it was my fault and a very expensive and dumb mistake to make, but back then, I simply was not aware of the danger of seed phrases and simply forgot the raw txt files on my harddrive. A few days ago some sort of malware must have scanned my files and found the seeds. I did not open, display or even have been in the corresponding folder for months (so a keylogger/display logger is highly unlikely to have captured them).

Furthermore my laptop was just sitting at home with nobody but me having access to it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To provide some proof, here are the corresponding transactions (as you can see multiple people must have gotten scammed like my):

BTC: 

f6fa5f91e7d74f04c01f82b1c5ecbcfcbd0f87306cd6911f78fb38321cffdb19

&amp;#x200B;

ETH:

0x18b1a3a19b8a2206e20d0228f7adf16085f2c92d039df377a9e6ec23ee705575  
0x2acc0b6d124f567dda6da18482fc90f05b297509df168b1414cf278fd706e918  
0x5fa103a3ddf7d6d3264d6a477a321e69add11324a16e53bcb1fc23424d596b94 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do next, but let this be a warning to everyone. Even though it was just about 5000€ and some people got scammed for much more: NOTHING is save. You can try to protect your funds, but making one small mistake can compromise everything you have worked for.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it was my mistake and I should have known better, but if you want to donate something (of course only if you want to), here are some addresses:

BTC: 36icZToMAJLq5u7acDieiTbU2tPo5pcDMr  
ETH: 0x3559d0d2E0f60F37aD103Ce893fEdcfef44dd70b 

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin scammer on zebpay's twitter account...,"So, zebpay is a bitcoin exchange in india. Recently they put out a tweet saying that they would return people's rupees. This is their tweet: https://twitter.com/zebpay/status/1036907034556411904

If you see the comments, there is another tweet by a guy whose account name is also zebpay: https://twitter.com/RaevkaRinat

He put out a tweet saying that there is a eth giveaway if you send some eth to some address. Something like send 0.5 to 20 ETH to some address and get 5 to 200 ETH bacnk.

https://twitter.com/RaevkaRinat/status/1036907038243057665

He links to this site: http://eth2321left.pw/ethgift wherein you have to choose between bitcoin and eth payments. The site shows many transactions being done. But if you see the blockchain you will see only receiving transactions, no outgoing transactions.

Can someone help me prove this article is wrong!," Public awareness on Virtual Currencies in Sri Lanka

​The  Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is aware of the growing interest in  virtual currencies (VCs), both domestically and internationally.

The  term “virtual currencies” is commonly used to refer to digitally  created representations of value that are issued by private developers  and denominated in their own unit of account. Common examples of virtual  currencies are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.  Virtual currencies are not central bank issued

currency.

Virtual  currencies such as cryptocurrencies use decentralised peer-to-peer  digital networks to authorize transactions. Due to the absence of a  centralized authority such as a Central Bank to guarantee the value of  the currency and regulate transactions, there is no recourse in the  event of any user or transaction related issues or disputes.

The  value of virtual currencies is dependent on speculation and is not  backed by an underlying asset or a regulatory framework. Due to this,  virtual currencies may demonstrate major volatility. Similarly, there  appears to be a high probability of virtual currencies being used in  illegal activities. Further, though unintentional, their usage could  amount to breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing  of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws. Therefore, cryptocurrencies, in the present  form, may pose significant risks in terms of financial, operational,  legal, customer protection and security related risks to their users as  well as to the economy.

It is hereby  notified to the public that CBSL has not given licence or authorization  to any entity or company to operate schemes involving virtual  currencies, including cryptocurrencies, and has not authorized any  Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

Where i bought my first BTC!,"A little less than a year ago today I wanted to invest a small amt into btc. I googled it and found this atm in parma ohio. I purchased 10 dollars first just to make sure i was doing everything correctly. Once i received the btc I decided to put another 100 in. Next thing i know im up 100 percent then 200 and so on. Wow! I thought. Intrigued i was. After a couple weeks research and watching many alt coins going up 400-1000 percent or so on the day/week i decided i wanted to try trading. Moved my btc to binance. During the bull market I believed i was an expert trader. Any coin i decided to buy was the right coin. Turned 100 dollars into 1000 or so. Little did i know the bear was on his way claws bearing ready to swipe any value i had. As the bear market ensued, and more than a few bad trades on my behalf, I came to realize i was no expert, I was an amatuer getting eaten alive by sharks. Took a short time but eventually i quit trading all together. It was rather addictive and hard to stop. To this day i am still down 60 percent or so on my original 110 dollars. The lesson? Don't trade unless you are an expert! For most of us the best option is to put in a small amount you can afford to lose ( Luckily i did) and hodl. Had i done that i would still be up.

A history of Bitcoin – told through the five different groups who bought it," 

[**www.fmz.com**](http://www.fmz.com/)

The recent fluctuations in Bitcoin’s value are just the latest in a series of spectacular peaks and troughs since it was created in 2009. (Though its price has been falling recently, it remains five times higher than last April, before the latest major peak began.)

Commentators are often dismissive of Bitcoin buyers, writing them off as naive victims of a fraudulent bubble. But if we look more carefully, we can trace the history of Bitcoin through five key narratives. Each has drawn in a different group of buyers and in doing so contributed to its long-term growth in value.

The idealists

Bitcoin arose from a tiny group of cryptographers who were trying to solve the “double spend” problem facing digital money: “cash” held as a digital file could easily be copied and then used multiple times. The problem is easily solved by financial institutions, who use a secure central ledger to record how much everyone has in their accounts, but the cryptographers wanted a solution that was more akin to physical cash: private, untraceable, and independent of third parties like the banks.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution was the Bitcoin blockchain, a cryptographically secured public ledger that records transactions anonymously and is kept as multiple copies on many different users’ computers. The first narrative of Bitcoin’s value was built into Nakamoto’s original “white paper”. This claimed that Bitcoin would be superior to existing forms of electronic money such as credit cards, providing benefits like eliminating chargebacks to merchants and reducing transaction fees.

The libertarians

[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

But from an early stage, Nakamoto also marketed Bitcoin to a libertarian audience. He did so by stressing the absence of any central authority and particularly Bitcoin’s independence from both states and existing financial institutions.

Nakamoto criticised central banks for debasing money by issuing increasing amounts of it and designed Bitcoin to have a hard limit on the amount that could be issued. And he stressed the anonymity of Bitcoin transactions: safe, more or less, from the prying eyes of the state. Libertarians became enthusiastic advocates and buyers of Bitcoin, more as an act of rebellion than for financial reasons. They have remained highly influential in the Bitcoin community.

The savvy young

These, however, were small constituencies, and Bitcoin really started to take off in July 2010 when a short article on [Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters](http://slashdot.org/)(“news for nerds”) spread the word to many young and technically savvy buyers. This community was influenced by the “Californian ideology” – belief in the capacity of technology and entrepreneurs to transform the world.

Many bought small quantities at a low price and were somewhat bemused to find themselves sitting on significant investments when the price multiplied. They became used to huge fluctuations in the price and frequently advocated “hodling” Bitcoin (a mis-spelling of “hold”, first used in a now iconic message posted by an inebriated user determined to resist constant “sell” messages from day traders). The hodlers insisted, half seriously, that Bitcoin was going “to the moon!” (used 178,000 times on the bitcointalk forums), and talked of buying “lambos” (lamborghinis) with their gains. This countercultural levity generated a sense of community and a commitment to holding Bitcoin that helps to sustain its value.

The investors

[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

The last two groups that have contributed to Bitcoin’s history are more conventional. What I consider the fourth group of investors consists of speculators who have been attracted by the volatility and peaks in Bitcoin prices.

On the one hand, we have the day traders, who hope to exploit the volatility of Bitcoin’s price by buying and selling quickly to take advantage of short-term price movements. Like speculators in any other asset, they have no real interest in the larger picture or of questions of inherent value, but only in the price today. Their only narratives are “buy” and “sell”, often employed in an attempt to influence the market.

On the other hand, we have those who are drawn in by news of price bubbles. Ironically, bubble narratives in the press, often designed to deter investors, can have the opposite effect. These investors join what Keynes called a “beauty contest” – they only care what other people might be prepared to pay for a Bitcoin in the short to medium term future.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/xzr1gkzslck11.jpg)

The portfolio balancers

The final and newest group of Bitcoin buyers are the portfolio balancers: more sophisticated investors who buy Bitcoin to hedge against wider risks in the financial system. According to modern portfolio theory, investors can reduce the riskiness of their portfolios overall by buying some Bitcoin because its peaks and troughs don’t line up with those of other assets, providing some insurance against stock market crashes. This is an emerging group, but one that could significantly raise Bitcoin’s acceptability among mainstream investors.

Bitcoin’s value, then, has been built on an evolving series of narratives which have drawn in successive waves of buyers. While mainstream commentators are often dismissive of Bitcoin as lacking inherent value, all asset market values depend on narrative processes like these.

Bitcoin may well collapse again, but so may any other financial asset. Investing in Bitcoin is neither more nor less risky than investing in the latest technology company launched on the stock market without ever having made a profit.

FAQ about Bitcoin(3)," **Transactions** [FMZ](http://www.fmz.com/)

**Why do I have to wait for confirmation?**

Receiving notification of a payment is almost instant with Bitcoin. However, there is a delay before the network begins to confirm your transaction by including it in a block. A confirmation means that there is a consensus on the network that the bitcoins you received haven't been sent to anyone else and are considered your property. Once your transaction has been included in one block, it will continue to be buried under every block after it, which will exponentially consolidate this consensus and decrease the risk of a reversed transaction. Each confirmation takes between a few seconds and 90 minutes, with 10 minutes being the average. If the transaction pays too low a fee or is otherwise atypical, getting the first confirmation can take much longer. Every user is free to determine at what point they consider a transaction sufficiently confirmed, but [6 confirmations](https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know#instant) is often considered to be as safe as waiting 6 months on a credit card transaction.

**How much will the transaction fee be?**

Transactions can be processed without fees, but trying to send free transactions can require waiting days or weeks. Although fees may increase over time, normal fees currently only cost a tiny amount. By default, all [Bitcoin wallets](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) listed on [http://Bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org/) add what they think is an appropriate fee to your transactions; most of those wallets will also give you chance to review the fee before sending the transaction.

Transaction fees are used as a protection against users sending transactions to overload the network and as a way to pay miners for their work helping to secure the network. The precise manner in which fees work is still being developed and will change over time. Because the fee is not related to the amount of bitcoins being sent, it may seem extremely low or unfairly high. Instead, the fee is relative to the number of bytes in the transaction, so using multisig or spending multiple previously-received amounts may cost more than simpler transactions. If your activity follows the pattern of conventional transactions, you won't have to pay unusually high fees.

**What if I receive a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?**

This works fine. The bitcoins will appear next time you start your wallet application. Bitcoins are not actually received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is shared between all the devices on the network. If you are sent bitcoins when your wallet client program is not running and you later launch it, it will download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about, and the bitcoins will eventually appear as if they were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend bitcoins.

**What does ""synchronizing"" mean and why does it take so long?**

Long synchronization time is only required with full node clients like Bitcoin Core. Technically speaking, synchronizing is the process of downloading and verifying all previous Bitcoin transactions on the network. For some Bitcoin clients to calculate the spendable balance of your Bitcoin wallet and make new transactions, it needs to be aware of all previous transactions. This step can be resource intensive and requires sufficient bandwidth and storage to accommodate the full size of the block chain. For Bitcoin to remain secure, enough people should keep using full node clients because they perform the task of validating and relaying transactions.

**Mining** [**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

**What is Bitcoin mining?**

Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Bitcoin data center except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners operating in all countries and no individual having control over the network. This process is referred to as ""mining"" as an analogy to gold mining because it is also a temporary mechanism used to issue new bitcoins. Unlike gold mining, however, Bitcoin mining provides a reward in exchange for useful services required to operate a secure payment network. Mining will still be required after the last bitcoin is issued.

**How does Bitcoin mining work?**

Anybody can become a Bitcoin miner by running software with specialized hardware. Mining software listens for transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network and performs appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners perform this work because they can earn transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and newly created bitcoins issued into existence according to a fixed formula.

For new transactions to be confirmed, they need to be included in a block along with a mathematical proof of work. Such proofs are very hard to generate because there is no way to create them other than by trying billions of calculations per second. This requires miners to perform these calculations before their blocks are accepted by the network and before they are rewarded. As more people start to mine, the difficulty of finding valid blocks is automatically increased by the network to ensure that the average time to find a block remains equal to 10 minutes. As a result, mining is a very competitive business where no individual miner can control what is included in the block chain.

The proof of work is also designed to depend on the previous block to force a chronological order in the block chain. This makes it exponentially difficult to reverse previous transactions because this requires the recalculation of the proofs of work of all the subsequent blocks. When two blocks are found at the same time, miners work on the first block they receive and switch to the longest chain of blocks as soon as the next block is found. This allows mining to secure and maintain a global consensus based on processing power.

Bitcoin miners are neither able to cheat by increasing their own reward nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Bitcoin network because all Bitcoin nodes would reject any block that contains invalid data as per the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Consequently, the network remains secure even if not all Bitcoin miners can be trusted.

**Isn't Bitcoin mining a waste of energy?**

Spending energy to secure and operate a payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other payment service, the use of Bitcoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy. Although unlike Bitcoin, their total energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be as easily measured.

Bitcoin mining has been designed to become more optimized over time with specialized hardware consuming less energy, and the operating costs of mining should continue to be proportional to demand. When Bitcoin mining becomes too competitive and less profitable, some miners choose to stop their activities. Furthermore, all energy expended mining is eventually transformed into heat, and the most profitable miners will be those who have put this heat to good use. An optimally efficient mining network is one that isn't actually consuming any extra energy. While this is an ideal, the economics of mining are such that miners individually strive toward it.

**How does mining help secure Bitcoin?** [**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

Mining creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add new blocks of transactions into the block chain. This protects the neutrality of the network by preventing any individual from gaining the power to block certain transactions. This also prevents any individual from replacing parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which could be used to defraud other users. Mining makes it exponentially more difficult to reverse a past transaction by requiring the rewriting of all blocks following this transaction.

**What do I need to start mining?**

In the early days of Bitcoin, anyone could find a new block using their computer's CPU. As more and more people started mining, the difficulty of finding new blocks increased greatly to the point where the only cost-effective method of mining today is using specialized hardware.

**Security** [**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

**Is Bitcoin secure?**

The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record, and the Bitcoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project in the world. Bitcoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is pretty similar to physical cash stored in a digital form. Fortunately, users can employ sound [security practices](https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet) to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance against theft or loss.

**Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?**

The rules of the protocol and the cryptography used for Bitcoin are still working years after its inception, which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, [security flaws](https://bitcoin.org/en/alerts) have been found and fixed over time in various software implementations. Like any other form of software, the security of Bitcoin software depends on the speed with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are discovered, the more Bitcoin is gaining maturity.

There are often misconceptions about thefts and security breaches that happened on diverse exchanges and businesses. Although these events are unfortunate, none of them involve Bitcoin itself being hacked, nor imply inherent flaws in Bitcoin; just like a bank robbery doesn't mean that the dollar is compromised. However, it is accurate to say that a complete set of good practices and intuitive security solutions is needed to give users better protection of their money, and to reduce the general risk of theft and loss. Over the course of the last few years, such security features have quickly developed, such as wallet encryption, offline wallets, hardware wallets, and multi-signature transactions.

**Could users collude against Bitcoin?** [**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

It is not possible to change the Bitcoin protocol that easily. Any Bitcoin client that doesn't comply with the same rules cannot enforce their own rules on other users. As per the current specification, double spending is not possible on the same block chain, and neither is spending bitcoins without a valid signature. Therefore, it is not possible to generate uncontrolled amounts of bitcoins out of thin air, spend other users' funds, corrupt the network, or anything similar.

However, powerful miners could arbitrarily choose to block or reverse recent transactions. A majority of users can also put pressure for some changes to be adopted. Because Bitcoin only works correctly with a complete consensus between all users, changing the protocol can be very difficult and requires an overwhelming majority of users to adopt the changes in such a way that remaining users have nearly no choice but to follow. As a general rule, it is hard to imagine why any Bitcoin user would choose to adopt any change that could compromise their own money.

**Is Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum computing?**

Yes, most systems relying on cryptography in general are, including traditional banking systems. However, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. In the event that [quantum computing](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/6021/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix/) could be an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use post-quantum algorithms. Given the importance that this update would have, it can be safely expected that it would be highly reviewed by developers and adopted by all Bitcoin users.

I Finally Figured Out Bitcoin," Economists,  
Lieutenants,  
Agents in the Field,

lend me your ears!

[www.fmz.com](http://www.fmz.com/)

For I have finally figured out bitcoin! And truthfully, this is one of my best mental achievements. And hopefully, through my ability to write clearly and explain things, I may be able to explain bitcoin to us all.

I had listened to this [podcast of Stefan Molyneux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4HGVJjqDVk) on bitcoin. It was very good, but did not fully answer my question, ""why does a bitcoin have any value?"" However, what the podcast did do is bring my perception or ""observation"" up high enough that I could finally see and conclude how bitcoin does actually have value.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/e08e0fzlldk11.jpg)

To understand why bitcoin has value, you first need to think about why currencies exist in the first place.

The answer from an economics 202 class is ""to avoid barter.""

Barter is horribly inefficient. If you are a cow herder and want a pint of ale, well, you're out of luck. Because you can't trade a whole cow for a measly pint of ale. Nor can you slice off pieces of beef from the live cow to make the trade more fair. Therefore, if any kind of economic trade and progress is to be made, you need a currency.

Historically, this has meant anything from gold and silver to salt and sea shells. But regardless of what item inevitably becomes an local economy's currency, they all have some key traits and qualities in common.

**Divisibility** \- You can divide gold, silver or salt into measurable quantities. Pounds, ounces, grams, etc. This allows you to scale the currency to the value of the item you wish to purchase.

**Durability** \- The currency cannot rot or decay over time. Milk is a bad currency because in 3 years time it will be quite gross. Gold in 3 years time will still be gold.

**Store of Value** \- The currency must also maintain its value and purchasing power over time. If you're like Venezuela and constantly printing off more commie paper money, it will lose its value. But with a limited supply (gold, silver, diamonds, etc.) you can assume that currency will still have roughly the same amount of purchasing power as it did.

Finally, [FMZ](http://www.fmz.com/)

**Intrinsic Value** \- The currency must have some kind of real value. Gold can be used for jewelry. Silver can be used in electronics. Copper can be used in plumbing. Salt can be used in cooking. In other words, people will take it as a currency, because even if they don't use it themselves, they know somebody who will. It does have an intrinsic value unto itself.

And it is here (intrinsic value) where most people get lost on bitcoin.

Bitcoin meets all the OTHER characteristics and traits of a good currency. It's divisible. It's durable (infinitely as it is digital). And it will not decay (again, binary doesn't decay).

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/v1jnxkeoldk11.jpg)

But precisely what practical, real world application does it have? You can't use it in electronics. You can't make jewelry (aka - buying sex) with it. So why does it have any intrinsic value at all?

The answer lies in comparing a currency's ""intrinsic value"" versus its value as a currency.

For example look at what has served as the primary currency throughout most of human history - gold.

Why does gold have intrinsic value? [FMZ](http://www.fmz.com/)

Economists will answer, ""because you can use it in jewelry"" which is the polite person's way of saying, ""men can buy sex with it.""

But does that make any sense? That ONE thing you can do with gold, ""make jewelry"" is why it served as the standard currency for thousands of years across the planet? What you'll soon realize is that, yes, while gold can be used to make jewelry it serves a much more important function to society as a currency. In other words, an item's value as a currency is really not dependent on its intrinsic value. It just needs SOME intrinsic value to get people to have faith in it and start trading it.

Salt can be used to flavor and store food. Was that grounds enough to make it the Mali Empire's default currency?

Silver can be used to make jewelry and some industrial items. Was that grounds enough to make it the currency of the wild west?

Large clam shells could make some funky and uncomfortable bras in ancient Polynesia. Was that grounds enough to make it the default currency in the south Pacific?

Apparently so, because it DID HAPPEN. But not because of jewelry making potential or food storage potential. That was just ""enough"" intrinsic value to suffice. It was because those items provided more value to the economy as a currency than it did some as jewelry making materials or food flavoring. And to prove it an interesting comparison would be to compare the amount of gold (or silver) actually being used as jewelry versus that of currency, bullion or investment. I'd surmise over time, 90% of silver and gold has been used as a currency and NOT tiaras.

Understanding that a currency derives most of its value from its NON-intrinsic value traits, and only needs a ""little"" intrinsic value, this then puts the focus on how bitcoin derives it's ""little"" but necessary intrinsic value.

The answer is simple - scarcity.

Consider diamonds.

Why do they have value? [FMZ](http://www.fmz.com/)

Taking the jewelry and industrial drilling uses of it away, why do they have value?

The answer is, they don't. They serve no purpose. At least from a PRACTICAL or PURPOSEFUL perspective.

But because they are so rare people will scramble for them. But understand what we're talking about when we talk about ""scarcity"" or ""rarity."" It is in relation to other things.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/93s6ekhsldk11.jpg)

On this planet there is 9 quadrillion megatons of dirt and maybe 100,000 pounds of diamonds. Both dirt and diamonds have no real practical use or value, but diamonds are considered infinitely more valuable. Ergo, when we talk about scarcity, is merely a RATIO between two items that determine whether it is valuable or not. It is simply the ratio of the supply of one thing on the planet (copper) versus that of another (platinum).

And this is why bitcoin has that wee bit of necessary intrinsic value. It is very much like diamonds in that is has no practical use, but it is scarce. Matter of fact, diamonds, gold, silver, rare earth, etc., are constantly being dug up out of the ground. The makers of bitcoin have limited their supply to 21 million units forever, making it even more scarce.

In the end, bitcoin is really nothing more than a private sector currency akin to digital diamonds. And it is my opinion, you have a currency that is better than any official government fiat currency out there as it cannot be hyper-inflated away by a central bank. However, there are some drawbacks to bitcoin.

One, it is completely dependent upon the internet working. Any post apocalyptic event that shuts it down or turns off the electricity, and it's about as valuable as those gold ETF's you have. Two, it is not yet universally accepted by people. This may change over time, but it is a distinct (though growing) minority who use bitcoin. Three, it is such a threat to other established currencies I have no doubt in my mind governments will do everything they can to put the kibosh on it. Fourth, it can be undermined by another digital and more preferable currency.

Regardless, whether bitcoin ends up becoming a universally accepted currency is another matter. the key economic lesson to take from this is what drives the value of a currency is not so much its intrinsic value as much as it is the amount of value society puts on it as a tool for exchange.

📷📷**“余额宝”模式和持币分红模式**

HIEX交易平台要比其他平台更受到币友欢迎的王牌杀手锏就是其创新的引入了数字资产银行“HiEX BANK”，采用了和余额宝一样的收益模式。并且平台还有每日的收入分红，平台会把每天100%的收入分配给HC的持有者，通过HiEX BANK+ 收入分红让你放着就有钱赚。

**HiEX BANK 分红介绍：**只要你持有HC币就可以享受HC平台分红和闲置收益，让你放着就有钱拿！引入了“余额宝银行”机制和“持币挖矿”，用户通过持有平台币即可享受挖矿的超高收益：举个例子如果你有1000 HC价值1000人民币，当天静态收益率为1%，动态收益率为3%，那么你今天收益率为：1000\*1%+1000\*3%=40人民币。这是目前市面上所有交易所都做不到的！！！

**平台收入分红介绍：**平台每天会将100%的收入分配给HC的持有者，例如今日平台的收入折合是100万人民币。一共有1000个流动的HC，那么每个HC币就可以收到折合1000人民币的分红。如果你有100个HC币，那么一天的分红就能达到10万元！真正的躺着赚钱！

给大家看一下这是我的HiEXBANK的收益

https://i.redd.it/ot9lx33j2ek11.jpg

像这种持币8000HC的小户，每日双重收益可以达到150左右，要是几万的大户每日收益都赚翻了。

**还有一个小技巧在这里偷偷告诉大家。**

HiEX官方还有一个HC超级商城，这里还可以用HC币换到实物。价格是根据当天的开盘浮动价格定的，预计HC开盘价格在3元以上，那么如果你现在持有等值2000人民币的HC开盘即可在超级商城购买iPhone X，2000元就可以在开盘购买HC是的赚钱就是这样的简单

📷

https://i.redd.it/a7lbo1ak2ek11.jpg

现在的HC币价值由私募阶段的0.25元涨到了0.51，并且保守估计开盘价格将达到3元以上赚钱要趁早，开盘后HC币前景绝对无限明朗，并且币量有限，兑换完永不增发。现在入手开盘之后更可能涨到至200元！如果你现在入手2000元的HC币那么开盘你的2000元HC开盘之后就可以变成80万元以上，请不要在错过下一个比特币！HiEX数字货币交易平台官方https://www.hiex.in/?invit=CIKPNE或填写邀请码CIKPNE，赶紧上车，别让自己未来后悔莫及！！！

Bitcoin has been a better investment than fiat," I know you love talking about Venezuela in this sub but today I bring you a story about Argentina.

 In recent days the Argentinian peso has devaluated a lot, over 20% from one week to the next, and the downward trend doesn't seem like its stopping.

 I bought about 300USD/4000 ARS worth of bitcoin back in the summer. I made several purchases, first one at 15K then at 13K and finally at 8K. At that time the one dollar was worth between 18 and 20 Argentinian pesos. Today the USD is reaching 40.

 Last week I checked, even though I made most of my purchases back when bitcoin was over 12K its still been a better investment than if I had kept my money in fiat.

 PS: I'm sorry if the math doesn't check out, I've made several purchases at different exchange rates both for bitcoin and ARS and didn't write them all down, all I know is I spent 4000ARS and now I've got a bit more than that.",1536150106,05/09/2018 12:21:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9d5zlk/bitcoin_has_been_a_better_investment_than_fiat/,1

So did RSK do it own ICO? More info inside,"I so confused. I always thought RSK would just use bitcoin like how Ethereum uses Ether for gas. But in newer reports there is a token called RIF. So is RIF like a RSK labs ""utility token"" to pay for its services?
In these articles they talk about RIF:

https://medium.com/coinsolidation/rootstock-908392d4c7c6
Was there every an official announcement by RSK labs for this? 
By the looks of it-Bitcoin will still be be used to pay for gas in RSK but RSK labs in order to fund themselves created there own token and will accept payments only in that to help services build on RSK?

timlshort.com,"## [The Late Evaluation Effect And Financial Markets](https://timlshort.com/2018/06/01/the-late-evaluation-effect-and-financial-markets/)

Evaluations made later in a sequence are more positive — what effects will this have on the thinking of investors?

It is no secret that people dislike working hard.  The corollary is that they like not working hard.  This much is well-known, but perhaps less obvious is that this can affect our judgments.  There are various experiments reported in the psychological literature which show that if a scenario is arranged such that the people involved are having a better time, or working less hard, they will make more positive judgements.  This can be quite alarming.  For example, it has been shown that judges making parole decisions are more likely to be lenient right after lunch and more strict before it.

A recent experiment has expanded this literature in a direction which I think is interesting in a financial markets context.  The University of Virginia’s O’Connor and Cheema, writing in *Psychological Science* in the issue of 01 May 2018, describe a bias of this type.  I will term it the Late Evaluation Bias.  They observe the following.

&gt;*Evaluations become more positive when conducted later in a sequence*

The authors examined three particular types of evaluation.  These were those made by judged across 20 years of *Dancing With The Stars*, university professors who had taught the same course for several years and people judging short stories over a couple of weeks.  In each case, they found that evaluations became more positive as time went on.

I think this is a variant of the types of bias I mentioned at the outset.  People find it easier to do something when they have more practice doing it.  This means they need to put in less effort so they will find it less like hard work.  This is fine, but the strangeness is that this will then lead them to make more positive evaluations.  Note that this is rightly called a bias since it will lead to a systematically false evaluations.

How might this play out in financial markets?  One simple and obvious answer is that investors will tend to be more positive than they ought to be when evaluating a stock they have evaluated many times before.  Someone who has looked at owning GE stock many times in the past will be more likely to find it easier to do again and will therefore be more likely than is justifiable to come to a positive decision on that stock.  This could feed into bubbles such as Bitcoin, although there is no reasoned positive evaluation possible of that cryptocurrency since it is valueless on fundamentals.

Similarly, people will evaluate asset classes with which they are more familiar more positively than they ought to.  This could be behind the well-known and expensive tendency in investors to be over-invested in their home markets.  This tendency can be avoided without entering dangerous frontier markets.  US investors could safely invest in the UK market without taking much additional risk and vice versa.  Both groups would gain valuable diversification.

People who have never bought a corporate bond will find it harder to evaluate than an equity if they have considered equities many times previously.  This will also rob them of a potentially valuable diversification.   The answer, as it often is, is to do more work!

Huge stash of dark market bitcoins on the move,"*It’s a like a Hollywood movie. A shadowy figure works out out how to plunder a huge hoard of cash hidden away years ago by person or persons unknown, somehow connected to the criminal underworld. The money moves but no one knows who’s doing it — only that something big is happening, and that there are machinations going on far behind the scenes that most of us will never understand.*

Thousands of bitcoins sat in numerous accounts that have been dormant since 2014 have started moving. The original address and the activity connected to it have been the topic of an extensive investigation by [reddit user sick\_silk](https://www.reddit.com/user/sick_silk). The total value of those accounts, including BCH and other fork coins, approaches a billion dollars.

In one post he discusses the [origins of the BTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/); in another, he shows that [large amounts — around $100 million — have just been moved to Binance and Bitfinex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ceb5v/1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_owner_transfers_100m_to/) — suggesting they will be sold for alts and USD respectively.

From the analysis, it seems that the bitcoins ultimately come from a Silk Road address — the famous dark market that sold drugs and other illegal items for BTC, and that was shut down by the FBI in 2013. It appears that the coins were ‘tumbled’ back in 2014, and split among many different addresses. However, it was still possible to link them back to the original account, which was set up in 2011, with a transfer associated with Ross Ulbricht: the ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ who founded the Silk Road.

Sick\_silk is apparently an old redditor but has created a new account to post his insights and conclusions. Asked why he used a freshly-created reddit account, he simply replies ‘Good opsec’: someone is moving a lot of money and if it’s connected to the Silk Road or other illegal activity, there may be some unpleasant characters behind it. Anonymity is wise under such circumstances — though all of the data required to conduct his analysis is available online, thanks to the transparency of the blockchain. As he says:

*I can track the owner’s funds, but I cannot find out who he/she is.*

*Also if I am able to graph this, imagine what the FBI/CIA/NSA/… can do with their tools and brains…*

*So I think I am not really a threat to this owner, however I prefer staying Anonymous just in case*

*And if I die (!!!), someone else will be able to continue the work, it’s free.*

*Peace.*

The discovery that this massive stash of BTC is being sent to exchanges is a big deal because it signals some very large sell orders may be about to hit the market — for USD (or USDT), on Bitfinex, and for alts on Binance.

It’s also interesting that the coins, clearly linked to the Silk Road, haven’t been touched in four years. It’s possible that someone who conducted various illegal activities several years ago has sat tight on their BTC (perhaps because, languishing in prison, they had no alternative?), and is now about to reap the benefits in a major way. Perhaps Ross Ulbricht, who was sentenced to life without parole for running the Silk Road, has finally given up the keys to a fortune. Or perhaps it’s some other early adopter who frequented the Silk Road back in the day, either as customer or merchant.

Perhaps the most likely scenario is that Ulbricht was telling the truth when he maintained that the Silk Road was not run by him alone, and that more than one ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ had access to those coins.

*There’s a* [*lot more to this*](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2018/08/800-million-bitcoin-whale-starts-moving-funds-associated-with-silk-road-s-operator/)*, both fact and speculation, and doubtless further details will emerge in time. This is an intriguing story that harks back to a different era in bitcoin’s history, as well as one that has ongoing implications for the crypto sector today.*

Blockchain.com Stole my Bitcoin.,"Now before you devote this thread and pass on my story as if I made a newbie mistake. Hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently in the beta stages of developing a OTC exchange for the South African Bitcoin market. We decided on [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com)'s Receive API v2 as our method of generating new addresses to receive Bitcoins from users. The full documentation of this api can be found on their site [https://www.blockchain.com/api/api\_receive](https://www.blockchain.com/api/api_receive) Kindly reference this documentation on my further statement. 

&amp;#x200B;

We applied for a API key and was provided one. We then used the documentation to implement the API and did so successfully using the parameters and guidelines of the documentation. The root of my issue came from something called the gap\_limit. This parameter description is explained from the docs in the following manner 

&amp;#x200B;

'You can control this behavior by optionally passing \`gap\_limit\` as an extra        URL parameter. Please note, this will **not** increase the  number of addresses that will be monitored by our servers. Passing the  \`gap\_limit\` parameter changes the maximum allowed gap before the API  will stop generating new addresses. Using this feature will require you  understand the gap limitation and how to handle it (for advanced users  only)""

&amp;#x200B;

Due to this statement we decided not to pass or edit the gap limit within our get requests for a new address. We did this because they state quote 

'As defined in BIP 44, wallet software will not scan past 20 unused addresses. Given enough        requests from this API that don't have a matching payment, you could generate addresses past        this horizon, which would make spending funds paid to those addresses quite difficult. For        this reason, this API will return an error and refuse to generate new addresses if it detects        it would create a gap of over 20 unused addresses. **If you  encounter this error, you will either need to switch to a new xPub  (within the same wallet is fine), or receive a payment to one of the  previous 20 created addresses'**

&amp;#x200B;

We assumed on our side ( our fault for doing this ) that if we don't edit the gap\_limit it will default to 20 as their servers only scan up until a 20 gap\_limit. However after implementation and beta testing with a small client base over time accumulated some unpaid addresses that added up to 20 unused addresses. Then a user created a order, despite the gap\_limit being reached the api still returned a address, this address was the 21st address. 1 passed the gap limit. 0.83432528 BTC was sent to this address and no btc was allocated to my [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) wallet like in the passed with other orders that used addresses generated by my xPub and API key. 

&amp;#x200B;

After days of debugging and investigation the conclusion was made that in fact, the address was the 21st generated address therefore despite [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com)'s API saying it will return a error if exceeded, did not. To confirm this we then implemented the gap\_limit and set it to 18. Followed by tests resulted in a error when exceeding the set gap\_limit of unused addresses. Now we confirmed the issue and implemented a solution but our bitcoins were still in a address which belonged to me and had my bitcoins in but were unaccessible due to [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com)'s servers not scanning passed the 20 gap\_limit. They appeared to be stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

I went through the correct channels by opening numerous support tickets, all resulted in the same cycle of events. I open a ticket explaining what has happened, generic response, my further response goes ignored. This repeated over 4 tickets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Almost a month goes by and still despite my efforts of getting my BTC back I could only sit and watch the BTC dwindle away block by block. Till the 2018-08-31. 

&amp;#x200B;

A transaction on the address came about and it was a outgoing one to a much much larger address. To big to be any single person or even potential hackers address ( Yes we did consider this possibility during debugging and investigation and the conclusion was no tampering was found) This destination address appears to be that of one that would likely belong to [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a look for yourself here is the address that was generated passed the gap\_limit, 

[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1Ar23WEvzW8obJWZfgtvQ5Z43AVtCUXoTe](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1Ar23WEvzW8obJWZfgtvQ5Z43AVtCUXoTe)

&amp;#x200B;

The minor transactions made after the initial large ones were done during my efforts to get a call back response for the api to allocate my funds but those were unsuccessful. The end point of the Bitcoins landed here in this address

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s)

&amp;#x200B;

My conclusion is aided by the following points in regards to my accusation that [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) pocketed my mistake instead of assisting me in recovery which in their docs does claim to be challenging but as the bitcoins have moved was obviously achieved not for my sake but for theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

\-They ignored my support requests instead of Replying with constructive possible solutions or efforts to worth with me

\-Their twitter account ignored my tweets and went on to reply to others

\-My understanding and flow of the issues resulted in me writing off the BTC as a loss due to them not being able to recover it as it was passed their servers set bounders. But they accessed it and took it. 

\-No explanation from [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com)'s side on what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is Life? A Bitcoiner's Perspective,"Life is an imitation of Bitcoin blockchain.  


Everyday in your life is like a block in that distributed ledger. The tasks you do, the places you travel, the books you read, the fun or pain you have are like the transactions happening in a block (approximately every 10 minutes). The morals and values of the society, country or religion that you associate with are like the proof of work consensus algorithm honored by nodes participating in the bitcoin network. Once something happens in your life, the day you lived already can never be reverted back just like the transactions in the blocks that are immutable. Just like some faces of your life are visible to everyone as your public wallet address, there are some parts in you that no one can know except yourself similar to the secured cryptographic private key for your wallet.

Just like we have many types of people walking on earth - good or bad; male or female; white, brown or black; rich or poor - there are many participants in bitcoin's network - developers, node owners, community members, traders, exchange owners.  


Life is an imitation of Bitcoin.

can dandelion be implimented as a light wallet?,"since once finally broadcast to the network a TX should look no different than any other, I don't see why it couldn't be done without any change at protocol level.

I also recall some unspecified hypothetical risk of an observer being able to catch what dandelion attempts to hide (origin IP for a TX) but since that's *definitely* revealed to remote node regardless without dandelion, wouldn't that just mean that in a worst case scenario the TX would simply be as revealing as all TX are now?  Wouldn't that mean dandelion would be worthwhile just in case it works as intended even if that's not a guarantee?

Last but not least, regarding the unspecified threat to it's efficacy, I can only think of two weaknesses but am curious if it's something else.

threat #1: if a nosy adversary controls enough nodes participating in dandelion, they could potentially follow the stem even though the extended path is not revealed to any one hop.

threat #2: anyone with ability to dragnet surveil much of the internet or many large ISPs could deduce from watching packet flow &amp; timing which encrypted hops likely belong to one stem/path

if these are the two threats, would the following countermeasure potentially have any benefits?

having the dandelion enabled light wallet que transactions for a round time (or block) increment, so that all participating nodes (and light wallets) would coordinate to unleash dandelion transactions in big bursts of network activity to make packet timing analysis significantly harder.  Could do a broadcast pulse at 1:00 UTC, then 1:30, then 2:00 and so on (every half hour, on the half hour) or every time the current block height is a multiple of 5 or something.  This would mean dandelion transactions would usually have somewhat of a wait but that may be worthwhile if it makes their efficacy more resilient to large scale network analysis.

I know IP address is but one of many pieces of info revealed with a transaction, but if you could drastically reduce the odds that a wallet address is ever reliably associated with an IP address, other things done to mitigate other information leakage could be far more effective.  Also simply hiding your true IP (borrowing another by some means or another) doesn't stop multiple wallets from being correlated to each other by all being used from the same IP, even if that IP reveals nothing else useful, so long term ips and session ips are both very revealing when you use multiple wallets even if your origin ip masking method of choice is actually working (and it might not be)

forgive me if these are stupid questions/ideas

Evading Whales Using Bots?,"Some hours ago a whale decided to sell a large quantity of his Bitcoins which made BTC drop by about 5%.

Since selling most likely occurs at a single crypto exchange, are there any bots that detect these ""whales"" and automatically sell BTC.

Is it even possible to do that because of the speed of market arbitrage?",1536178274,05/09/2018 20:11:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dafnu/evading_whales_using_bots/,1

"Post-bitcoinization, a few concerns","These concerns were put forth to me not as a concern about bitcoin, but the issues which led to the ending of the gold-backed currency era in 1971.  I have rephrased these and put them into a future tense to describe the challenges a ""fully bitcoin economy"" might again face.  Keep in mind, this is in a post-fiat collapse scenario. Bitcoin has already won.

I'd be curious to hear the thoughts and opinions of fellow bitcoiners on how we might mitigate these similar issues (or why these are non-issues in the first place, or are only limited to Gold and not crypto).  

&gt;1. Bitcoin will become more scarce when its most needed - during a crisis, people will hodl on to their bits in fear of losing their wealth. In crisis, we _should_ encourage spending to encourage growth (as in many growth models), so having monetary flows slow down is the last thing we want. As an example, see 1847 crisis.

&gt;2. The bitcoin emission rate is deflationary, will lead to deflation, and amplifies macroeconomic disturbance.  In order to preserve bitcoin, interest rates will have to be set high - making borrowing more expensive and hence limiting investment, again slowing growth.

&gt;3. It restricts the use of expansionary monetary policy, as this would lead to an outflow of bitcoin. It therefore will cause deflationary shocks.  Governments will try to maintain their bitcoin reserves no matter the cost - usually at the expense of increased unemployment. Again, higher unemployment leads to slower growth and deflation, and low aggregate demand led to even further upward pressure on unemployment.

HODL is it profitable or not?,"Each cryptoman is somehow familiar with the term HODL - investing in the crypt by the principle of ""bought and hold"". About a year ago, when I began to make my first timid steps in the cryptomir, I learned about this strategy, and began to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

The first my crypto assets, which I began to walk, are the tokens of the projects that I received for participating in the bounty of these projects. I am a maximalist in my life, so I participated persistently and efficiently in bounty campaigns, especially at the beginning of my crypt career. Bounty of social networks and bounty of blogs, plus different airdrops, allowed me to get hold of a lot of different kinds of tokens from different projects. The sums are of course penny, but in its mass it was going to something impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

So month after month I earned tokens and stayed with them, in the hope that these coins would give the cherished X-boxes. Greed, I was attacked by a real toad and a greed for profit. I began to buy different coins and keep them until the moment of the native.

&amp;#x200B;

Like many of us, cryptomaniacs, in my crypto-portfolio there appeared tokens favorites. In the next review, I'm not just telling you whether it's profitable or not, I'll bring real figures from life.

Have you entered the blacklist today? Blockchain helps improve the integrity mechanism of the tourism market,"In all walks of life, honesty is the foundation of an enterprise. The integrity of an industry is related to the rise and fall of the industry. But in the tourism industry, the various acts of dishonesty in travel agencies are countless, and when new After the application of blockchain technology in the tourism industry, it is expected to help rebuild a new credit system.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3e15pi00yik11.png

According to the ""Kunming Travel Agency, Branches and Practitioners"" ""Red and Black List"" system, it was learned that in June, Kunming travel agencies, branches and employees ""Red and Black List"" (the first issue) have been announced, a total of 10 travel agencies entered “Red List”, 66 travel agencies, branches and practitioners entered the “black list”. The honesty and trustworthiness of the travel-related enterprises was included in the red list, and the violation of the principle of honesty and trustworthiness was included in the black list, which paved the foundation for the tourism industry.

However, in order to establish a long-term industry credit system, in addition to various government departments' rectification and policies, the new information technology strength cannot be ignored. Whether the blockchain has established with the existing online platform in the establishment of the credit system What is different?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/73n66i02yik11.png

Existing platforms in the market use big data to build consumer credit resources, but only in their own private and centralized data systems are data islands. The “decentralization” technology of the blockchain allows all participants' credit records to be distributed in different blocks of the blockchain platform. The data is transparent and transparent, eliminating the need for the central server as a trust intermediary to disintegrate data islands. In addition, the authenticity of the information and the irreversible modification can be guaranteed at the technical level.

Take two blockchain travel platforms as an example: On LEOOY's blockchain technology platform, all participants' information is saved after AI+ big data screening. If there is a travel agency before entering the blacklist, then the information It will also be recorded and not falsified, not only the credit history of the travel agency, the consumer will be recorded on the system if there is untrustworthy behavior or unethical behavior in the transaction process, and all information except the privacy information will be disclosed. The shock is quite strong.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8ygz3x83yik11.jpg

Moreover, the platform is only responsible for the operation of the platform. All participants participate in the community construction, the platform's own incentive mechanism and the smart contract constraints to jointly build a big data credit system.

On the Airbnb platform, reputation is extremely important, with different dimensions of credit scores, in the future the user's reputation reaches a certain level in order to rent a specific type of house. Airbnb uses blockchain technology to better establish a reputation platform for merchants and travelers, and also to effectively store identity information.

On traditional platforms, blockchain can use technology to solve industry pain points.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6h9h3uu4yik11.jpg

The intangible modification, decentralization characteristics, smart contracts, distributed accounting system and other characteristics of the blockchain help to improve the long-term integrity mechanism of the tourism market, making the list of ""black list"" less and less, let the ""red list"" ""The list is getting more and more, so that consumers can feel at ease, comfort, and make the regulatory authorities more worry-free.

I first broadcasted transaction 1. Then broadcasted transaction 2 short after and before transaction 1 confirmed.

After 10 minutes transaction 2 was gone from the mempool and transaction 1 was confirmed. 

While I was expecting transaction 2 to confirm because it had a much higher fee.

Transaction 1 had a 60 sat/byte fee and transaction 2 had a 950sat/byte fee.

Is there a way to improve the chances for transaction 2 to get mined instead of transaction 1 in such a case?",1536205428,06/09/2018 03:43:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9defps/double_spending_how/,1

Let’s take a look at 99% of the fault-tolerant consensus,"  

On August 7, 2018, Vitalik published an article on his blog: A Guide to 99% Fault Tolerant Consensus.

**This theory is nothing new:**

In a synchronous system, if the malicious nodes do not exceed 50%, information broadcasted by honest nodes is guaranteed to reach other honest nodes as long as given enough time. In other words, in this case, the system fault tolerance rate is 50%. If we loosen the preconditions of synchronization and look at an asynchronous network, the maximum fault tolerance will be reduced to 33%. Furthermore, if we add protection preconditions, such as requiring observers to actively monitor the consensus process, fault tolerance can be increase to 99%.

This conclusion was made a long time ago. It was described in a well-known paper by General Leslie Lamport in 1982, ""The Problem of General Byzantium.""

📷

To put it simply:

• Through continuous signatures, time limit mechanisms and increased positive observers, we can achieve that the “truth” can be passed to honest nodes at over 95% or even close to 100%.

• In this case, the cost of stealthing a 51% attack increases, and it becomes 95% or nearly 100%.

• However when the number of honest nodes in verification nodes is less than 50% (synchronous network) or 67% (asynchronous network), this consensus cannot prevent malicious nodes from causing chain forks.

Our opinion is as below:

By increasing the number of observers in the ""sunrise crowd"" and at the expense of extending the second confirmation time, it is indeed possible to increase the fault tolerance rate. However benefits always come at a cost.

For the decision-making of the consensus mechanism, it is a three-choice multiple-choice question. They are: safety, fault tolerance, and liveness, and they cannot be simultaneously achieved.

**So to put it in an even simpler way:**

Suppose a network has:

N nodes, their labels are 0 to N-1

The upper limit of the network delay plus the time difference of the watch is D (for example, 8 seconds, which means that under normal conditions, one node information can be transmitted to another node theoretically in D).

Each node has the ability to pass a value to other nodes at time T. (A malicious node can of course deliberately delay or delay this time T)

**All nodes in the (N-1) \* D seconds period, run the following process:**

Define x:i, which means that the value sent before node i is x

Define x:i:j, which means that the value sent in front of node i is x. This is signed by node j.

**And so on and so forth…**

**Is it still too difficult to understand?**

**Let us give a real life example**

Suppose there are 3 people, labeled 0, 1, and 2. The communication between them can only be one-on-one.

0 decides one day “The target price of my bitcoin is 5,600.”, and sends this information to 1. So what 1 just received is equivalent to x:I, structured as:

Target of Bitcoin is 5600: @0 signed

And 1 will pass the message to 2 as:

(Target of Bitcoin is 5600: @0 signed)@1 signed

**In frank: “0 just told me his target price for bitcoin is 5600!""**",1536209961,06/09/2018 04:59:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dezgg/lets_take_a_look_at_99_of_the_faulttolerant/,1

"YEX Exchange on the currency system, how do you think?","Since July, the currency ring has been in disarray. BTC prices have fallen, and even daily trading volumes on exchanges have fallen, as Fcoin, which used the deal to dig ore for a while, is now closing its trading and digging.

&amp;#x200B;

Something interesting has recently been discovered, called the ""currency system on General certificates,"" which means that a project that passes an exchange audit and security certification can put money on the exchange free of charge. The exchange will only charge the equivalent of 200ETH or 200ETH for airdrop to users who hold exchange platform currency.

&amp;#x200B;

To put it simply, the system converts the users' platform coins to get the certificates of rights and interests of the airdrops. Users can receive the candy airdrops continuously by holding the platform coins.

I was told that there was an exchange called YEX that was innovating on the ""pass currency"" system, and I looked briefly at their system.

We all know that prices fluctuate around value and the most important thing is to give value to Token if we want to stabilize the currency price. As a result, the YEX exchange allows users to receive 80% of the platform fee bonus when they hold the YEX, as well as confectionery airdrops from the coin item and YEX. In addition, YEX also intends to return 100% of the hidden income from the exchange to users who hold YEX, so that users who hold platform currency will become the real owner of YEX. And the traditional currency system obviously can not meet the characteristics of community autonomy.

YEX Exchange is very strict on the selection of the project side, the project side must pass the strict review of professional teams, after the audit is passed, 200 ETH to get 200 ETH equivalent tokens airdropped to the user, which tests the funds and strength of the project side.

We all know that the end result of the Fcoin explosion was that Fcoin's credential economic design was so clever that by combining legal transactions with coin mining, they guaranteed the output of YEX. It also stabilizes the price of YEX through the daily cash dividend and ""currency system on the card"", and creates a ""Token ecological circulation closed loop"" in the age of community-oriented Tongqi economy.

Certainly cannot say YEX's innovation must have no difference, absolutely perfect.

Let me take a simple example: if YEX has fewer or no currency entries over a period of time, or if YEX fails to create more new models to give platform currency value, then YEX is likely to repeat Fcoin's mistakes.

"Goldman Sachs, am I missing something here?","For background: In November BAKT will go live, there are 2 pro-ETF SEC commissioners now and the CBOE has an ETF application that will likely conclude around the similar time that BAKT goes live, if not relatively shortly after.

Goldman Sachs had been planning to create a trading desk, but due to lack of regulatory oversight has decided to focus on providing an institutional service.

Where from this does the market logically move down to this extent? Given the obvious run that will occur prior to BAKT going live and the obvious run that would occur from a positive ETF decision - what benefit is there is to manipulate the market down so aggressively?

I'm not sure I'm feeling as pessimistic as I should be right now, because this seems too choreographed to allow accumulation from very well connected parties, ready for Novemer - where Goldman Sachs could simply re-announce plans to make a public trading desk. At the same time BAKT goes live, potentially at a similar time the SEC approves an ETF. No, I'm not really feeling pessimistic at all.",1536218236,06/09/2018 07:17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dfxgm/goldman_sachs_am_i_missing_something_here/,1

WARNING! Never EVER use Changelly.com !!! - Money on hostage,"Hi all!

I want to share my experience/nightmare with you.

Yesterday I decided to use this service, promising transfer from crypto to crypto within seconds.

First I tried with a small amount and everything went smoothly.

Then I sent around 36000 $ worth of coins and the nightmare began!

The funds are on hold!

 

&gt;Dear Customer,  
&gt;  
&gt;Transaction q4ksqdzdmbvtog5e you've processed recently has been placed on hold since our risk management system marked it as suspicious.   
&gt;  
&gt;According to European AML directives and regulations, we ask you to provide us with a photo of your face with the ID document (passport or driving licence) valid in your country and a piece of paper with the date and the inscription ""Changelly"" on it in one photo with the attached picture on the background.   
&gt;  
&gt;Also, to accelerate the verification process, please provide us with official proofs of the origin of the funds in question.   
&gt;  
&gt;To do so, please send us any information that would allow confirming that you're the owner of those funds, such as the initial source of funds and/or exchange accounts with history (of the trading) and also where they came from.   
&gt;  
&gt;These documents must be sent in the following message.   
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your all provided documents in advance!

 

Usually an exchange first asks a user to be verified to raise limits on transactions an so on, but they hide this AML/KYC and they never warn you before doing some big transaction.

They advertise their service as fast, without limits and now they have my money on hostage!

 

Anyway, I know there are AML rules etc., so I sent them all the documents they required.

They replied:

&gt;Thank you for all the documents provided!  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the picture is almost clear for us. However, to complete the KYC verification procedure we ask you to provide us with a high-quality photo of your passport.   
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your understanding! 

 

Even if I don't like sending my documents around, I sent it and I had no more replies from them.

Since then I wrote asking for some updates and explained the origin of my funds, fiat deposits on Kraken and exchanging/trading in crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

No reply.

&amp;#x200B;

UNBELIEVABLE!

&amp;#x200B;

The future of Bitcoin lies in law and regulation - let's discuss that future,"This week me and some other guys came up with the idea to start a subReddit to discuss the law and regulation side of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and blockchain in general. We feel that it is a very important discussion for the future of the crypto landscape and one that is too often neglected these days in favour of price discussions.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore r/CryptoLegal was born and we already have over 100 enthousiasts who joined the discussion. We hope that this will really be a place where we can gather all the relevant research and legal opinions and discuss the future of crypto more in depth.

&amp;#x200B;

"That drop was pure manipulation and not profit take, I have proof.","Lots of people blame Goldman Sachs' decision to suspend their plans for a crypto trading platform for the drop that happened beetwen yesterday and today, but it's all wrong. Why? I searched for news about that decision but the oldest article was published about 20 hours ago, but strangely, the drop happened about 25 hours ago! So my theory is that Goldman Sachs' shorted BTC and then gave the news, so they could then buy BTC pretty cheap. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know, these days people keep speaking of some wallets moving big amounts of coins to exchanges, so probably Goldman Sachs took the opportunity to sell at the same time and dump BTC hardly... We broke the ascending resistance for these shi..y whales. They are ruining this crypto world.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone explain to me market wide red/green days?,"Hi Reddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

Im sure this has been asked before as I cant be the first person to wonder this. I have followed crypto currencies about 1.5 years and no matter what during bull runs, bear markets etc, the entire market seems to move up and down with each other. If you go to coinmarketcap today you'll see the top 100 cryptos red. When they are green, they are all green (obviously not virtually but definitely a common trend). This does not make sense to me. Clearly I do not understand something. Anyone care to explain?

Why Proof of Reserve exchanges are the future!,"Trusting an exchange with your funds can leave the body constantly feeling feeble. Funds can be hacked, the exchange could go broke, or your keys could get lost. Finding a secure exchange can be complicated; adding together the pros and cons. There are a lot of factors that differ in exchanges, users will align with one they can trust most. Trust usually translates to a feeling of safety, but crypto is not so simple. Because the cryptocurrency community relies on trust and transparency, they expect the exchange they store with to hold to the same standards. Exchanges attract users through large trading pairs, fair fees, and secured keys. The key to trust is in trusting the exchange to put it’s users first; meaning if anything were to happen, users would be protected. One way of securing a users trust is providing them with a proof of reserve. 

A proof of reserve is a form of an audit; an audit is a means of financial inspection of assets to cover liabilities. There is a procedure in which exchanges must hold a reserve balance of the same number as an anonymized set of customer balances. The audit is there to ensure users that the exchange is covering them in case of a bankruptcy, hackings or other issues. The exchange must submit a JSON file relaying all exchange addresses and their balances, this file is then compared to the blockchain. If an exchange can prove they are holding more than 100% of user holdings, they will be approved of the proof of reserve stature. Proof of reserves is a method of ensuring users that they are covered and cared for by the exchange, this is why BOA exchange is verifying this statement to users through a proof of reserve. It may not be the perfect means of verifying solvency, but it is a step few other exchanges have taken to emphasize transparency and trust, making BOA one of few to truly want what's best for users.


Why BOA is better?[BOA Exchange ](https://boaexchange.com)

BOA is not only going through the proof of reserve procedure to brag and bring in more customers; BOA is an exchange out for advancing cryptocurrency and the lives of those using it. BOA is enabling in-exchange key storage, this will allow for users to freely access their funds without the stress of losing their keys. In the case of a hack, reserves are kept in cold storage and will be used to pay out to those who lost, cementing a relationship built on reliability. BOA also has an increasingly growing number of trading pairs, continually looking for new and better project tokens for users to buy, trade and store. Users will be able to trade with industry-leading transaction fees, remaining below the 0.1% threshold while others average out at about 0.2%. Everything BOA does and implements is to ensure users ease of use. Users can also chat to the rest of the community to find out “when moon?” through the BOA chat feature; allowing the whole BOA exchange community to exchange conversations, this is one of the only exchanges to be integrating such an exclusive feature. Whatever BOA does is based on the communities needs, ensuring no user is ever left behind. BOA will continue to work on their exchange and ways to better it, check out how far they have progressed:

W. Scott Stornetta is considered to be one of the founding fathers of current blockchain technology.  Out of 8 citations in the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, 3 of them (4 by some accounts) were of the work of Stornetta and his partner and friend Stuart Haber. 

He was a cypherpunk who dedicated his time at Xerox Park and Bell Communications Research to cryptography and distributed computing.   

It was a joy to chat with him about the history of the blockchain, how he learnt about bitcoin, uses of blockchain tech before bitcoin, and what he refers to as ""corporation 2.0"" of the future, where we'll start to see all kinds of power structures become decentralized. ",1536248403,06/09/2018 15:40:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9djti2/the_missing_link_between_satoshi_bitcoin/,1

Real reason for the dump is simple and the solution is too.,"The world markets are becoming very unstable and bitcoin was making a move from slow organic buying. The  elite and banking cabal can NOT have a hedge against their failing system so will use derivative exchanges and whales to scare everyone away.

The solution is for people to BUY SPOT btc and remove immediately from exchange so they can't take your coins and lend it to  a seller which causes artificial supply.

BUY SPOT.. and move it to wallet is the only way to beat them. ",1536250518,06/09/2018 16:15:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dk5p9/real_reason_for_the_dump_is_simple_and_the/,1
What Will Happen To Bitcoin After All 21 Million Coins Are Mined,"Bitcoin shows some similarities to gold as an asset. Neither bitcoin nor gold can be created arbitrarily. Gold has to be mined from the ground and Bitcoin via digital means. The founders of Bitcoin clearly articulated that Bitcoin, like gold, must have a limited and finite supply. Bitcoin has a mineable supply of 21 million coins. Once these many coins have been mined, the total supply will be tapped out unless Bitcoin’s protocol is altered to allow for an increased supply. Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that, like gold, the fixed supply of the currency allows for banks to be kept in check and prohibited from arbitrarily issuing fiduciary media. The question, however, remains – What will happen when the global supply of Bitcoin is tapped out?

Effects on Bitcoin Miners

The group most directly impacted by the supply limit of Bitcoin is definitely the Bitcoin mining community. On one side, you have the skeptics of the limitation of Bitcoin who argue that miners will be forced away from the block rewards they receive for their efforts once the Bitcoin supply in circulation has reached its limit. This will make the mining community begin to depend on transaction feeds to maintain their operations. Bitcoin.com argues that miners will find the cost of this process unsustainable and that this will lead to a decrease in the number of miners, a process of centralisation of the Bitcoin network and many negative effects on the ecosystem.

In this debate, there is an assumption made that transaction fees on its own will not be sufficient to keep Bitcoin miners financially solvent after the mining process has been completed. However, there is also reason to believe that transaction fees and mining costs will even out somewhere down the road. Looking far ahead in time, it is not impossible to imagine that mining chips will become much smaller and highly efficient. This would decrease the burden placed on miners and would decrease the threshold of an initial cost required to become a miner. Further, we could see an increase in transaction fees and this could help keep miners afloat.

Price of Bitcoin

Bitcoin’s price has risen exponentially from its starting point and has lost much of its value from its peak level. It has been a rollercoaster ride that you simply don’t want to get off of.

Nobody has complete clarity about how Bitcoin will continue to manifest itself onto the larger financial world but it seems plausible that its limited supply will be a leading factor in driving the price back up. There are large piles of inactive coins that are stored across the world, the largest of which belongs to the individual or group that created Bitcoin, the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. It is possible that this supply of about one million coins is being saved for a time when the global supply is faced with increased levels of demand.

Tried to remind him that he can't buy pizza with it... He said that it is \*better\* than Bitcoin... So I retorted that gay sex is more manly because it involves two men, then he said he can profit more from BCH and he will sell in 5 days. Seriously, why is greed such a strong motivator?

Huge stash of dark market bitcoins on the move," *It’s a like a Hollywood movie. A shadowy figure works out out how to plunder a huge hoard of cash hidden away years ago by person or persons unknown, somehow connected to the criminal underworld. The money moves but no one knows who’s doing it – only that something big is happening, and that there are machinations going on far behind the scenes that most of us will never understand.*

Thousands of bitcoins sat in numerous accounts that have been dormant since 2014 have started moving. The original address and the activity connected to it have been the topic of an extensive investigation by [reddit user sick\_silk](https://www.reddit.com/user/sick_silk). The total value of those accounts, including BCH and other fork coins, approaches a billion dollars.

In one post he discusses the [origins of the BTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/); in another, he shows that [large amounts – around $100 million – have just been moved to Binance and Bitfinex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ceb5v/1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_owner_transfers_100m_to/) – suggesting they will be sold for alts and USD respectively.

From the analysis, it seems that the bitcoins ultimately come from a Silk Road address – the famous dark market that sold drugs and other illegal items for BTC, and that was shut down by the FBI in 2013. It appears that the coins were ‘tumbled’ back in 2014, and split among many different addresses. However, it was still possible to link them back to the original account, which was set up in 2011, with a transfer associated with Ross Ulbricht: the ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ who founded the Silk Road.

Lost Bitcoin,"I mined bitcoin in 2011 or 2012- How do I find my old wallet?

I know for a fact that sometime in 2011or 2012 I signed up for a mining pool and ran the MacMiner app on my Mac OS X to mine bitcoin. I remember getting a wallet address - does this mean the wallet was for sure on an exchange or could it be in my email that I used back then. I got the old Mac out and tried to search for a wallet.dat file and could not find one but I'm not sure if I would have done this via an exchange or not. Any emails regarding signing up for an exchange or an ""online"" wallet. would be in an email that I don’t use anymore and I’m trying to recover my old p.w. to get access to that 
Do I have any hope? Am I searching in vain? What are the chances of recovering any bitcoin if I had that software running for approx. 6 months in 2011/2012 ?

Yes, I barely know what I'm talking about. I know this. Sorry in advance.",1536255132,06/09/2018 17:32:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dkxb4/lost_bitcoin/,1

$1B bitcoins on the move: MtGox vs SilkRoad origin and BTC crash discussed,"This is the 4th post of a series of articles dedicated to investigate $1B worth of bitcoins (111,114  BTC/BCH/... BXX) that were dormant since 2014 and started moving  actively. The BTC coins were originally located at this address ([1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a)).

* The facts that part of this funds (&gt;13%) have been transferred to Bitfinex, Binance and Bitmex exchanges is discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ceb5v/1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_owner_transfers_100m_to/).

&amp;#x200B;

Today I am writting a short update to discuss the origin of the funds.

Wizsec, a prominent Bitcoin security expert, seems to be pretty sure that the wallet is belonging to a MtGox hodler and early investor who is not a DPR or SilkRoad user. You can read more here:

* [https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/wizsec-confirms-bitcoin-whale-wallet-address-belongs-to-mt-gox-vs-silk-road-user/](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/wizsec-confirms-bitcoin-whale-wallet-address-belongs-to-mt-gox-vs-silk-road-user/)
* [https://twitter.com/wizsecurity/status/1037030003068653569](https://twitter.com/wizsecurity/status/1037030003068653569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1037030003068653569&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinexchangeguide.com%2Fwizsec-confirms-bitcoin-whale-wallet-address-belongs-to-mt-gox-vs-silk-road-user%2F)

I advice everyone to go through those really interesting readings.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the most probable hypothesis for the wallet's origin:

1. a SilkRoad user or DPRs wallet per this post: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310600.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310600.0)
2. a MtGox cold wallet that has been seized or is still owned by MtGox: in  fact the wallet funds moved in March 2014 right after MtGox filed for  bankruptcy one month earlier in February 2014;  these movements dates  are really similar to the [200,000 lost coins ""found"" by Karpeles](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/21/mtgox-missing-70m-bitcoin) which moved March 7th, 2014 ([1dda0f8827518ce4d1d824bf7600f75ec7e199774a090a947c58a65ab63552e3](https://blockexplorer.com/tx/1dda0f8827518ce4d1d824bf7600f75ec7e199774a090a947c58a65ab63552e3)), just 2 days before the movements on the wallet we are talking about here.
3. a whale wallet since the major part of the 111,111 coins are coming  from a very old deposit of 37,421 coins processed on June 21st, 2011  making this an early adopter's wallet  ([70d46f768b73e50440e41977eb13ab25826137a8d34486958c7d55c5931c6081](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/70d46f768b73e50440e41977eb13ab25826137a8d34486958c7d55c5931c6081))

Finally, Wizsec and I agree that this wallet is not CSW\`'s wallet despite it is mentioned in court documents. Wizsec spent a lot of time debunking CSW's ownership claims earlier this year.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this wallet origin?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I wanted to report some events that could be related to this 1933f wallet activity:

* $100M USDT were [transferred](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) (reported by u/whalecheetah) while the owner was in the process of transferring approximately the same amount to several exchanges;
* a [10,000 BTC](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/f2465a1225531d33696380f06034499a52d707f85ee6ae1419885980011f6e25) buy order was filed last night on [Bitmex](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/3BMEXqGpG4FxBA1KWhRFufXfSTRgzfDBhJ) with 8,030 BTC transferred from a [Bitfinex user wallet](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g) while the 1933f wallet owner transferred at least 10,000 BTC to Bitfinex since August 24th.

&amp;#x200B;

In the light of this yesterday's price crash, do you think the $100M transferred to the exchanges caused it?

"I made a complete bitcoin spreadsheet (excel) with live crypto price updates, moon math, and a full history of your Portfolio and trading performance."," 

This is a spreadsheet that I have developed for myself over the last year or so. I have found it very helpful for keeping track of my bitcoin holdings (great for tax purposes) and how well my trading decisions have been (not great). I figure it's time to share.

There is a lot in here including;

Automatically updates prices from coinmarketcap. Nearly 2000 coins included. Just select which ones you want to track by typing in the name.

You can even choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any country.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zgsggn369pk11.png

No need to record details of every trade. Just keep track of your bitcoin purhcases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yqt28sf79pk11.png

&amp;#x200B;

This data gets saved every time you save the spreadsheet.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b00vize89pk11.png

I find this very handy to see if your trading is actually profitable compared to the HODL method.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0d8o7dba9pk11.png

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yes and there are plenty of 'moon math' and analytics to see how bitcoin is trending and how far off you are from a lambo. This includes a full history of bitcoins price which updates every time you open the sheeet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pveh8ehb9pk11.png

Also includes a bitcoin block countdown time (i.e number of days untill halvening), and a 'regret calculator' among others.

free download from here. Instructions inside. You will need macros enabled (if you want it to do the fancy stuff).

Help fund charitable projects using bitcoin,"**BitGive** has three active fundraising campaigns:  
  
1. Stop Elephant and Rhino Poaching  

2. Help Local Malnourished Communities  

3. Help Children with Bad Eyesight Thrive  


For those not aware BitGive created a [platform](https://www.givetrack.org/) for charities to raise money in bitcoin.  

Why raise funds in bitcoin rather than traditional financial instruments?  Accountability!  Donors are able to verify 100% of their donations are received by the charity.  In addition they can audit how funds are spent.  


You do not want to spend bitcoin since you bought it at a higher price?  Buy back the amount you donate after and it's a wash...

The truth about technicals,"I know that people on this sub dont take kindly to technicals, i understand that and im not asking anyone to put their money to what im saying, now that that's out the way id like to discuss a few things. 

#1 day traders / swing traders

Day traders and swing traders will almost indefinitely trade with technicals and charts (anywhere from 15 minute charts to weekly charts), the only occasion on which they dont do as such is with news. Now you may be thinking we've had loads of brilliant news and developments, where's the pumps? Traders will put their money with the momentum. Without a doubt we are and have been in a bear market for 9 months or so, theyre not interested in buying/long on news rather shorting any piece of bad news to fit the trend aka ride the wave.

#2 scenarios 

A lot of people will call technicals bullshit on the basis ""anything can be drawn up"", which is absolutely right, however technical analysis is a scenario, a foresight based on current evidence, as time progresses the evidence is always changing hence theres no fixed scenarios, scenarios will almost definitely always be modified to adapt to the situation.

#3 why we arent at the bottom 

If you look at the 2014 crash or any market crash for that matter its often the case that volume and price actipn are reduced massively before the next bull run, as we are currently still experiencing waves in price action (see weekly chart) i do not believe we have reached that point. 

#4 evidences

As aforementioned we are in a bear market, if you want to make the most of this situation the best thing you can do is get educated. From my perspective we are currently in a bearish wave and soon will be testing/breaking 5750 support to achieve prices of 4800-5325.

What evidence do i have of this?

If you open up tradingview and look at the BTCUSD weekly chart you should recognise that prior to the 2017 bull run there is a red candle with a lower wick of 5325 therefore providing support at that level before the market turned into an absurdly bullish bubble, furthermore if you turn on the stochastic rsi indicator you will see the current momentum is bearish, this in combination with relatively high rsi signals a downward momentum to search for lower pricing.

As always i could be wrong and this is open for discussion, i understand a majority of us here are investors not traders and this is not trading advice, however should this scenario play out im sure some of you would be happier understanding the reasoning and technical framework behind a bear market.",1536284985,07/09/2018 01:49:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dpm34/the_truth_about_technicals/,1

Question about the 10 minute creation rule,"Hi guys,

I've only recently started learning about the mechanics behind the price and have a lingering question that I can't answer online.

If a block takes 10 minutes to be created does that mean that only a max of 144 blocks can be created every day? (1440 minutes in a day / 10 mins block time)

Can a miner successfully work and solve more than one block at a time?

If so, how come there isn't a just a single miner out there with the strongest computer power, winning every race and creating every block?

I'm aware these might be very basic, but still appreciate your help with wrapping my head around them! Thanks",1536286733,07/09/2018 02:18:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dpuya/question_about_the_10_minute_creation_rule/,1

BTC Slump? Now You Can Hedge Against the Price Drop with OKEx Futures Product,"The crypto market has suffered a sharp decline yesterday, and the major currency [Bitcoin](https://www.okex.com/) (BTC) has again dipped below the $7,000 point, falling $500 or about 5% in just over an hour.

Therefore, futures trading is the best choice for you to earn money by going short. For example, go short with 20x leverage using 2 of your 5 BTC at $7300, the price before Wednesday slump, and sell out all the betted BTC after the two drops at $6400. Finally, you will get $6400\*5 + $900\*2\*20=$68,000. Compared with the original $7300\*5=36,500, you’ve earned $31,500.

"Malware Targeting Bitcoin ATMs Goes on Sale for $25,000 - CoinNess.com","According to Trend Micro security researchers, a malware targeting Bitcoin ATMs has been discovered in the underground markets.  

The Bitcoin ATM malware which is being sold at a price of $25,000 takes advantage of a service vulnerability that allows users to purchase bitcoin worth 6,750 in either US dollars, British pounds or euros. The cryptocurrency purchases are done using Near-Field Communication (NFC) or the Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) pre-written cards which are provided to buyers of the malware. Per the cybersecurity researchers, the lack of standardization with regards to Bitcoin ATMs may be contributing to the security problem.

When Bitcoin price drops but you're a short-seller,"The crypto market has suffered a sharp decline yesterday, [bitcoin](https://www.okex.com/) shed almost $1,000 in 24 hours. I saw with my own eyes that the price dropped from $7,300 to $6,400 in less than 6 hours. Many of my friends squawked about their heavy and sudden loss of nearly 15% or even burned position with long-selling. However, that was not a bad time for short-sellers like me. I went short with 2 BTC by 20x leverage provided on my familiar exchange [OKEx](https://www.okex.com/) at the price around $7300, and hold it until the lowest point of the second drop, at the price around $6400, thus I earned $31,500 in the disastrous slump. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although futures trading is the best choice in this bitcoin bear market, i still don't recommend the 100x leverage for its huge risk. OKEx is my first choice because it provides 10x and 20x leverage which i can handle. please be cautious and rational in futures trading.

Is Now A Good Time To Buy Bitcoin?," 

Bitcoin prices have taken a beating lately, falling sharply over the last several months and dropping more than 15% in the space of 48 hours.

After suffering these declines, the digital currency is trading close to $6,450, according to the CoinDesk [Bitcoin Price Index](https://www.coindesk.com/price/) (BPI).

At this point, bitcoin is down more than 66% from its peak of roughly $19,800 reached in December 2017, additional BPI figures show.

Now, it is time for the million-dollar question.

Since bitcoin prices have fallen so much lately, is now a good time to buy?

When polled, analysts offered measured responses, emphasizing that there are both bull and bear cases for the digital currency.

 ""There is plenty of growth to come,"" predicted Zhang Jian, former CTO of Huobi and founder of digital assets exchange FCoin, emphasizing that the digital currency markets are still exceedingly small compared to the more traditional asset markets.

$1 Billion Bitcoin Wallet on the Move,"&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts from around the world are watching in shock as the old Bitcoin wallet sees new activity after years of being dormant. The wallet, which is in possession of over $1 billion in BTC, is now sending coins to at least two exchanges.

All around the world, coin-holders, investors, and even regular crypto enthusiasts are speculating regarding the new activity in an old Bitcoin wallet.

The Bitcoin wallet, which was dormant for more than 4 years, is waking up, and threatening to disrupt the market’s fragile balance. Many are already in a state of panic since the movement might mean that a giant dump is about to happen.

The address was supposedly founded back in 2011, on July 2nd. Since then, it did not move its coins until March 2014. Back then, there was a certain activity, as the owners of the wallet stated splitting their BTC supplies into smaller chunks. Recently, however, around 15,593 BTC was sent to Bitfinex and Binance, while 210 BTC ended up on Bitmex.",1536318986,07/09/2018 11:16:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dtdcn/1_billion_bitcoin_wallet_on_the_move/,1

I got robbed buying the dip. Please advise.,"I was trying to buy the dip so I posted my ads on localbitcoins. Someone contacted me and we scheduled to meet at 7pm at a Starbucks in my area. The seller says he was coming from a far distance and wanted to sell a high amount only.  I committed all my wife and mine saving of $30k to buy the dip.

Then 7pm came, I got in Starbucks and texted the seller,  the seller texted back saying he was late due to traffic, then later called me saying he was a few minutes away. I waited inside Starbucks with my wife for over 30mins and the seller never showed up. Then seller texted me saying he got in a car accident and will not come. 

As I leave Starbucks to go home, I noticed the tire pressure light was on so I pulled up to a gas station to check it out, I got a flat tire. As I put air in the rear tire I noticed a cut where the air was leaking, I thought it was interesting so I called my wife to come take a look. As we were paying attention to the slashed tire, someone called out to us saying they just saw a guy wearing hoodie sneaked into our car and ran away. By that time he already took off into the night with busy traffic so we couldn't see him. He took all $30k of our saving.

The only information I have of him is the phone number 951-505-6453. The gas station camera didn't point at our direction. Please any advice on anything I can do? I hope other people can learn from my lesson. Please excuse me for any grammar since English is my second language.

What about those Bitcoin dice strategies? Good way to make some extra btc?,"So I recently stumbled upon some YouTube videos where people use a special strategy in a dice game and earn some Bitcoin or altcoins.

e.g. here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZk3ZrMb8Hg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZk3ZrMb8Hg)

I'm wondering if this is a legit way of earning some Bitcoin on the side?

Does anyone have any long term experience with this? :)

I already tried it out a few hours with a token that is already preloladed into your account by the site, but not with real BTC. Seems good so far but I'm still unsure if I should deposit real Bitcoin.

"Looking to buy bitcoin, but I can't","So I'm trying to buy bitcoin right, I have 35SGD in my PayPal and I'm trying to convert some of that into bitcoin. Not for investing reasons. Problems is, everywhere I go, I need either an ID or a verified PayPal account to buy bitcoin. That's not gonna work because I'm under 18 so Im not gonna get a verified PayPal account (no bank acct.) and I'm under 18, so ID probably won't work either. I think the site Virwox doesn't need id or verified paypal, but their fees are so high and their site is so confusing, I don't know if I'm gonna end up doing the wrong thing or not. Is there a way around this? One way I though if was depositing money from PayPal into a site like BitSkins, a market for game items worth money, then cashing out using bitcoin, but they charge 10usd every bitcoin cashout so that only high cash outs will be used.

"The journalist who submitted the Business Insider ""fake news"" article (Dakin Campbell and Frank Chaparro) should be held accountable","It's one thing to have an article like this published on coindesk or cointelegraph, it's another thing to have it published on one of the largest business/financial news websites in the world. Regardless of what they've said to justify having that article published, it is clear as day what their intention was. Typical sensational style journalism meant to create panic and skepticism.

In such a volatile and unregulated environment, these type of articles do have an impact (especially when they're reported through large publications like BI). I personally think the two people responsible for putting out this garbage should be held responsible for this reckless style of reporting. 

I've already sent an e-mail to the Editor-in-Chief and Executive Managing Editor requesting that these two be barred from submitting future content to BI. I recommend everyone reading this do the same. Below is a link to the BI contact page, as well as links to both of their twitter accounts. I call on the community to mobilize and make an example of these two FUDsters in hopes to curb this type of nonsense.

Why Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are always costly on Indian Exchanges such as Koinex?,"I am not very experienced in Trading, but yes, I have invested in some crypto. Previously, the price fluctuation was according to International Market. But after RBI (reserve bank of India) rules, exchanges like koinex and zebpay are keeping the price of coins like Bitcoin very high. There is almost **50,000 rupees ($700 USD)** of difference than the International exchange price.

I understand that the price functions according to buyers and sellers. But, how is it possible that even after a strong dip in the Bitcoin, there is only slight movement in the price? Nobody is willing to sell at a lower price? Either something is wrong, or maybe I don't know how they work.

Can someone please shed some light on the reason behind this? Also, is there is any cheaper or better way to buy currencies from India?

Bitcoin Survey Suggests Bright Future For Cryptocurrency,"Bitcoin’s price could be about to experience a boost after it was discovered that American students are twice as likely as the country’s average to own the cryptocurrency. This discovery was made after a survey which was made and carried out by Coinbase and Qriously.

Close to one in five students in America who responded to the survey said that they own or have at some point owned bitcoin or another digital asset. This is twice as much as that of the general population which suggests that the ownership and adoption of bitcoin could be about to increase.
Students have proven to be good indicators of cultural and technological change. Facebook which is now the world’s biggest social network was only open to students in its early phase and found mass adoption among the younger population before experiencing the same in the older segments.

Another example can be taken by observing how the internet was used back in the 80s. It was predominantly used by students and universities to share research before being commercialized. Of all the students who took part in the survey, 17% said they think their knowledge of cryptocurrency and blockchain was very good compared to 9% of the general population who were asked the same question at the same time. However, the survey comes on the back of Coinbase’s CEO suggesting just earlier this month that commercial adoption of bitcoin for payments could end up taking quite some time.
This survey does, however, fall in line with a paper written by researchers at Imperial College London in July who predicted that digital currencies are set to be adopted by masses.

According to this report, bitcoin and other digital assets will hit the mainstream as a means for paying for goods and services inside the next ten years, just as many of those who were surveyed by Coinbase enter the working world.

One in four who were surveyed by Coinbase said that they would certainly take a course on blockchain or cryptocurrency. Universities are moving fast to satisfy this demand.

According to Coinbase, when David Yermack, the finance department chair at NYU’s Stern School of Business, initially offered his course on blockchain and financial services four years ago, 35 students enrolled, 8 fewer than the school’s typical elective.
By Spring of this year, the number of students who had signed up for the same course had jumped up to 230 and this forced Stern to move the class to its biggest auditorium. Coinbase found that over 40% of the best 50 universities around the world offer at least one class on cryptocurrency or blockchain and over 20% offer more than just one.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency classes are more popular and present in the US, it must be noted. Less than 30% of the 18 international universities on the list offers at least one class on the topic. Only two – the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the National University of Singapore – offer in addition to one.

Coinbase reviewed course catalogs at the best 50 universities in the world and found classes in cryptocurrency across various departments including finance and anthropology, thereby proving that the courses were not limited to computer science.
In fact, the increase in offerings across disciplines can be mapped to student interest: students with a varying set of majors said they would be inclined to taking cryptocurrency classes. Almost 50% of all social science majors said they’d be open to signing up for a crypto class. Meanwhile, the bitcoin price made a recovery this week by climbing above the all-important $7,000 mark.",1536335055,07/09/2018 15:44:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dvkri/bitcoin_survey_suggests_bright_future_for/,1

Lightning: Eli5 payment channels,"Given the early state of things I don't expect my channels to immediately start lighting up like Christmas trees, but after funding 6 payment channels to 6 other nodes, and now having 2 channels connected to me from 2 new nodes (that they have funded, not me) no money is moving. My fees may be higher than others and they're probably genuinely not being selected by a payment router, but I just want to make sure I am thinking of them correctly.

If ""outgoing"" channels are fully funded by me and the other party has contributed nothing, and the ""incoming"" channels are funded by the other party but I have contributed nothing, can money flow at all? Intuitively I would assume the money can flow out (but not in) on my funded channels, and in (but not out) on the ones that are funded by the connecting parties.

Is this correct? Do I just need to either wait longer to see some action, or lower my fees? I'm fine leaving everything alone - I just wanted to make sure I have it set up right in the first place. Do I need to add funds to the channels that have connected to me so that we both have funds in the channel?

I should clarify my purpose: I am a HODLer who does not buy anything with BTC - I am simply wanting to help the network by opening channels for others to use, not for me to have low-fee payments.

Thanks for any insight.",1536340312,07/09/2018 17:11:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9dwe0d/lightning_eli5_payment_channels/,1

mining using the CLI..,"hey,

my name is zero, i am very new to bitcoin, am in the process of downloading the core to an ubuntu box, and i am having a bit of difficulty sorting how to manually mine bitcoin using the command line interface.

in a perfect world, i would like to find some sample php code that mines using the cli, if possible, assuming that this is a valid question to ask... again, i am very new to bitcoin, so please forgive if i ask a stupid question..

i have done some very extensive reading on google about this, so i have done my homework before asking here about this..

i find the blockchain to be quite fascinating, and it will probably be my intent to rewrite the sha256 function in assembler, just so that i fully understand it..

kind regards,

"Don't use Cash App to buy bitcoin unless you're comfortable paying a pretty large premium on what they consider to be ""the spread"" (TL;DR: Hidden 1.3% fee)","I just did a test purchase on CashApp r/https://cash.me by Square (don't mind plugging it since it's not a good review for them) with $1000. It said the market was about $6407 which was $3 lower than what I was seeing on the global average. After I selected to buy $1000 worth, the following screen showed the current market as being about $6489, a whole $82 higher than the previous screen just showed! So I cancelled the order and it went back to the market screen showing it back to being worth $6407. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when you buy on the Cash App, there is a secret ""fee"" of around 1.3% that is disguised as a market spread. If they wanted to be honest and charge a fee that would be fine, but it's marketed as no fee with a small market spread, but that is way too much of a spread to be considered an honest trade.

Noobs view on last 24hrs and why crypto needs regulation,"Please stick with this ramble / musings of a mad man!!

Soooo, in the last 24hrs over $1000 wiped off the value of bitcoin.  Here’s what I think happened and will keep happening until bitcoin is regulated. 

A whale (financial institution, hedge fund or very wealth individual) shorts bitcoin when it’s on a bullish run, creates and published some FUD articles then dumps nearly a billion worth of cut price bitcoin from a dormant wallet onto the open market. 

The red candles appear and the day traders start getting jittery and start selling as they don’t want to loose the small profits they’ve made. This triggers the stop losses of sleeping half of the worlds traders, thus sending the bullish market into free fall. 

Meantime the whale sits back and watches the carnage and smiles counting his windfall from the shorts. 

Then the market bottoms out, holdl’s start buying the dip, the whale sees that it’s bottomed out, starts buying back all his bitcoin and more for a lot less then he sold it for.  Lots of profits again. 

Whale sits back watches the market turn bullish again and then repeats the process.

I’m a noob and have been buying the dip for a year and am about 50% loss ( shhh 🤫 don’t tell the wife)

In my opinion it doesn’t matter how many BTC ATMS show up, it doesn’t matter how many websites let you pay in crypto. 

Until the blatant insider trading and market manipulation is brought under control.  Small to medium bag holders don’t stand a chance in this game.

Who should give a shit about Bitcoin?,"1. People who want to send **payments**
2. People with **wealth** to protect
3. People who plan on having wealth someday
4. People who **know better than to trust governments**
5. People who **don't trust bankers**
6. People who **care**:
   1. Justice
   2. Fairness
   3. Freedom
   4. Peace
   5. Prosperity
   6. Good over evil
7. **Investors**

**Sending Payments** without the permission, restrictions or fees of a centralized third party.  There are billions of people with no bank account.  Now they can receive, store, and send money via a common phone.  Now we can all send payments to people in any country, without government/political restrictions.  For example, when Wikileaks was cut off from the existing banking system, people donated Bitcoin instead.  Do you want your bank to decide where you get to spend your money, to whom you can give it, from whom you can receive it?  I don't.

  
**Wealth to Protect, now or in the future.**  Bitcoin cannot be taken by force like other financial and physical assets.  Value stored in Bitcoin cannot be hyperinflated (or slowly inflated) away from you by any government or or central bank.  The IRS cannot confiscate your Bitcoin money.  Nobody can ""print"" Bitcoin from nothing in order to bail out their too-big-to-fail/too-big-to-jail cronies.  Bank savings can be and have been confiscated; real estate and businesses too.  Having at least **some** of your wealth parked long-term in Bitcoin provides an insurance against bail-ins, bail-outs, money ""printing"", government/currency collapse and other forms of fraud and expropriation.  You might not have much wealth now, but when you do, you should be glad Bitcoin exists to help you protect some of it.

  
Do you **trust the government** and/or **trust the big bankers**?  Recent events and historical facts suggest you're ignorant, a fool, or both.  Maybe you're too dumb to appreciate Bitcoin.  On the other hand, if you **don't trust** big government(s) and big banks, you should appreciate the qualities of Bitcoin which make it ""sound money"" -- an escape from doomed fiat ""play money"" created from thin air by crooked governments/central banks to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.

  
So far, Bitcoin has richly rewarded the **patient investors** who buy and hold, long-term, and who are able to stomach the wild volatility without reacting in panic.  I see no reason for this trend to end any time soon.

  
What does Bitcoin have to do with  **World Peace?** **Justice?  Fairness?**  This is a great topic for another post.

What do you actually own?,"I've been thinking a lot recently about what I actually own in my life. 

I have been thinking about diversifying my investments but once I think about it all it just doesn't make sense to me. 

I currently own and make payments on a house and a truck. Neither of these things do I actually own because if I fail to make payments on them the banks will just take them away from me.

Essentially the same idea with stocks, do I actually own a stock because a website says that I do? If Robin hood gets shut down what happens to my stock? What if my account is frozen for suspicion of fraud? 

In the future let's assume I have paid off my house and my truck and I now completely own both, I also have invested In gold. All of these things can still be taken away from me by the government or police on some bullshit charges or if I decide to stop paying taxes. I own my house and my truck as long as the state allows it and I follow the laws of the county that I live in.

Point being is that of everything I have in my life, Bitcoin is the only thing that I truly own that no one can take away from me. If I stop paying my taxes my Bitcoin cannot be frozen and taken from me. The police cannot come to my house and physically take my Bitcoin, they can take my hardware device and my seed but a simple rearrangement of a few seed words will make it impossible for anyone to crack besides myself. 

I've realized that Bitcoin is the only thing I own that cannot be taken away from me by anyone.

Please be careful,"Quality of decision cannot be measured by outcome, but by what information was available at the time of the decision. There is nothing factual you can say about crypto currency future. TA for all instruments is astrology, FA cannot be applied to crypto, and equity market can and will remain illogical longer than you remain solvent.

Do put money on crypto, money you'd be comfortable putting in scratchcard, it may pan out. But do not gamble your financial future on it. Don't encourage others, carry some responsibility on what you communicate.

&amp;#x200B;

Traditional advice applies, do not bet on single ticker (entire cryptomarket acts as single ticker, crypto fund does not reduce risk in meaningful way), buy broad market with low TER (CSPX, VOO, SPY). Or just spend money on something that immediately increases your quality of life.

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful, you can achieve financial independency with small risk and patience. You don't need to be all-in in a moonshot, plan to win even if all crypto fails.

"Showerthought: ""The world is transitioning into computer game like state regarding the enforcement of laws...""","Our generation already knows a new kind of 'legal system' very well. Computer games. It has a set of rules you must obey. The code is enforcing every law in the game, without a chance for the participant to break it (ofc there are cheaters and bugs). You can opt in and you can opt out as you desire.  

With decentralized systems this kind of order comes to the real world and will dissolve the nations states slowly.  

Bitcoin is actually a very strict system. It is a new authority with strict laws by code for anyone who opts in. There is no court, no lawyer, no judge. The code is unbreakable and you must play along. All you can do is opt out if you don't like the rules.  

While such kind of systems would be a desaster in a world of central authorities, they are liberating a decentralized world. Efficient, trustless and virtually uncorruptable. You just need to be able to opt in and out, which will ensure every individual is participating in a system where the rules are ones someone can follow. Just like in computer games.

Bitcoin and Numismatic Value...Can it be applied or not?,"Numismatics is the study or collection of currency, including coins, tokens, paper money and related objects. I think we can all agree Bitcoin is a form of currency. 

When dealing with the Numismatic Value of currency (an external value beyond the raw materials used to craft the currency), let’s say a coin or paper bill, it’s all about rarity, condition, and public demand. 

A low mintage coin is rare. A $500 US Bill is rare.  Uncirculated versions of both are worth more. Now if the coin or note had been previously owned by Elvis, you bet your sweet ass the demand would skyrocket...

So back to Bitcoin here, I’m trying to think of a valid argument in favour of Bitcoin, or perhaps A Bitcoin, having numismatic value...1 Bitcoin being worth more than another based solely off of rarity, condition or demand. 

I can’t see how condition would be applied, so that leaves rarity and demand. Maybe one of the original Bitcoins Hal Finney received would be in HIGH demand, but good luck tracing that back 9.5 years later (unless it’s on an untouched hard drive somewhere). That would definitely check the Rarity column too. 

Perhaps Bitcoin is the first currency where Numismatic value can never be applied.  Any scenarios out there where bit could be?

"The deposit travel contract dispute has been hotly debated, and the blockchain tour has come.","At present, although blockchain tourism is still in the initial stage of trial, the introduction of blockchain technology can bring new solutions to the solution of many chaos in tourism.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8adhjql3nzk11.jpg

In recent years, the tourism finance model has been sought after. Both traditional travel agencies and online travel platforms have launched various types of travel finance products, such as deposit travel, membership, and package sales. As long as the funds are placed in the travel agency for a certain period of time, they can make profits, which also attracts many consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

However, contract disputes arising from similar tourism products are sometimes seen in the media. For example, travel agencies such as HITO Tourism and Qingyang Tourism, which had previously occurred in Beijing, have attracted attention due to the “cash travel” financial model facing the run-off and financial constraints.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/d46c7ld9nzk11.jpg

This kind of incident occurs on the one hand because of the increasingly fierce competition in the tourism industry market, and also as a reflection of many chaos in the Chinese tourism industry. The introduction of blockchain technology may bring new tourism to the tourism industry. The development space brings new possibilities.

So, why can blockchain technology bring new changes to the tourism industry?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b46mgmibnzk11.png

In the traditional sense, the tourism industry has developed to this day, consisting of a number of industries, such as entertainment, food and housing, involving a very long industrial chain, which is extremely cumbersome and redundant. The emergence of blockchain technology will effectively change the shortcomings of the tourism industry.

&amp;#x200B;

First, enhance the transparency of transactions in all aspects of the tourism industry.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, the irresistible modification of blockchain technology can effectively prevent service information or service contracts from being tampered with. Guarantee the authenticity of products and services, reduce the travel costs of tourists, and enhance the travel experience.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vn9f965dnzk11.png

Third, the decentralization of blockchain technology has also directly eliminated the participation of intermediaries, making it difficult for third-party mechanisms to join the transactions between buyers and sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, the use of blockchain technology, consumers can achieve retrospective deposits anytime and anywhere, will have an impact on the transaction of the release of false information, help to ensure the personal safety of visitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth, the autonomy of the blockchain makes tourists more than one identity. They can be tourists, tour guides, or managers.

&amp;#x200B;

Deblocking, non-tamperable, and transparent blockchains can not only bring new changes to appeals, but also solve problems such as identity management, airline overbooking, and fake hotel website bookings. In response to various subdivision problems in the tourism industry, LEOOY is also using the blockchain to build different solutions: use the blockchain to connect service providers and consumers, remove the middleman links, suppliers can exempt commissions, consumption The direct sales price of hotel, air ticket, scenic spot and other tourism resources can be obtained, and both parties can also exempt the crediting cost.",1536401040,08/09/2018 10:04:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9e3925/the_deposit_travel_contract_dispute_has_been/,1

Does anyone know where I can find a reliable app developer?,"Hey guys,

Is there a trust less way of hiring an app developer (who can be from anywhere in the world as long as he/she speaks English) to realize an app idea of mine? 
Is there perhaps an trustless escrow payment service to do split payments with the biggest part of the payment being paid out after entirely finishing the app development?

Is there perhaps any kind of platform where freelance programmers have profiles and can be rated by users who worked with them before? 

I have certain ideas for apps but do lack the ability of programming. I am of cause willing to pay (in crypto) for the efforts  of developing those apps.
What would be the cheapest but most trust less way to realize that?

Boosting the value,"So from day one we told others about Bitcoin to drive them to buy, which in turn makes the value of the currency go up. We've known about this. But as a community, we should work together by spamming. If we went to news outlet websites and requested more news on bitcoins, constantly searched through their websites for articles specifically related to cryptocurrency and in the requests for more coverage by point towards articles of where big names have mentioned Bitcoin in the past. It might start a trend for the media to start covering it again just because other outlets are covering it. At this point any news coverage is good. It drives others to do research. It would be instantly hilarious if this turned to a political argument and all because we wanted to drive more people away from government backed money and to drive the value of our existing stash up.

What does everyone think? Would it be possible? Calm and collective or would we really have to work at organizing and discuss how to implement a full out plan of attack?",1536428313,08/09/2018 17:38:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9e5y6c/boosting_the_value/,0

Dear Bitcoin market manipulators,"Dear Bitcoin market manipulators,

I've put in around $2,000 into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since last year. I did it because I hate the banks and I believe in the technology. Unfortunately, I'm down something like 60% since then. The thing is that it looks like that I am about to buy a new condo and I need all of that money back. Can you please make the markets rise to levels that will enable for me to recuperate my losses? And while you're at it, can you make it skyrocket to the moon. I mean any gains earned will make my first home purchase a whole lot easier. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Take care,

Some economic myths that I have seen being propagated out there.,"1 - ""Bitcoin is a reserve of value"", ""gold is a reserve of value"", ""real estate is a store of value"".

Why is it an economic myth? Value reservations do not exist! All value is subjective. A substitute term would be reservation of property. Value does not exist objectively, it exists only in the minds of individuals and the idea of the value of ​​these individuals changes all the time.

If you buy a home today, there is no guarantee that it will be worth the same thing tomorrow (value reserve), but it is guaranteed that you will have the same house or at least the same matter (reservation of ownership).

Whether or not Bitcoin is a store of value, this is speculation. This can not be stated categorically.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - ""The more scarce, the more valuable"".

Value is always subjective. The law of supply and demand, although almost always right on probabilistic grounds, is not always true. (There are billions of people in the world if an item is scarce there is a high probability that someone wants this item.)

Diamonds are more abundant than you think and can be created in the laboratory, but they are valuable. Helium gas, which we use to fill balloons is scarce, to the frustration of several scientists around the world. But cheap.

(expensive and cheap in the perception of the value of this person who writes to you)

A shortage is not always synonymous with value. Human subjectivity is.

Another reason for the law of supply and demand is not always valid is the simple fact that there are artificial incentives in the economy (usually created by the state).

A second reason is an information. An item may be scarce and there may be people wanting to buy it. But these people do not know where they can buy this item.

In short, things are worth not because they are scarce, but because human beings think that scarce things have value or because human beings like / want / appreciate scarce things and are willing to pay for it (sometimes).

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Speculation

The economic myth here is to think that ""speculation"" is a bad thing. Speculation is only bad when it is not natural, that is when some state controls prices or increases the monetary base by misrepresenting the stock price system and crypto-coins. On the other hand, all human action is speculation. If you are reading this text, it is because you are speculating that it serves you something.

&amp;#x200B;

4 - ""The more work, the more value"", ""Bitcoin is worth because mining is a very costly process"" (Crypto surplus value).

The economic myth here is to believe that the price of a good comes from the labor that was employed in the production of this good.

If Bitcoin's work was synonymous with value, Bitcoin would be worth more day after day, because every day more energy is spent on mining and if we add up all the energy expended up to the present moment and compare with the next moment, we will see that the Bitcoin should have an ascending graph without oscillations (which does not happen). The hashrate of Bitcoin rises day after day and hashrate today is greater than that of December (when Bitcoin reached its historical high).

Hashrate of Bitcoin:

[https://www.blockchain.com/characters/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/characters/hash-rate)

If the energy or labor spent is synonymous with value, how do you explain the value of nonminerable coins? (Nano and Iota for example).

Again, Bitcoin, Nano, Iota, Decred or any other currency is worth because people believe it's worth.

&amp;#x200B;

5 - ""Bitcoin counts because it is safe or has a historical value"".

It may be true for you or for me, that I consider Bitcoin to have value because it is a safe medium. But this is not true for everyone. Because the value is subjective, vary for each person and varies according to time, it can not be said that the value of an asset comes from this or that reason. There are people who value Bitcoin because it is safe, others because it was the first currency, others because of other reasons. All are right. But the same reason is not valid for all the existing individuals in the world.

You can not speak for a group, majority or minority. Each has its own motives and valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

6 - ""The market"".

The market does not exist objectively. Just like the state and other collectives. What exists are individuals exercising their voluntary exchanges.

One can not speak ""the French are to blame for the war,"" or ""the market is looking forward to the next news."" To speak in the collective, when this collective is not something objective like ""I bought a dozen bananas"", ""I have 5 Bitcoins"", almost always induces to the error or the injustice. ""Not all the French are guilty of war,"" ""not everyone in the financial market is euphoric about the high.""

The ""market"" is not something we can point to and say ""the market is there"". If all the people in the world who participate in the market are excited about the price of Bitcoin, but one is not, it can not be said that the market is excited. It is a mistake.

Individuals speak for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

7 - ""The market is perfect"".

Another mistake. First that the market does not exist objectively, according to which the market is formed by individuals and individuals make mistakes and are not always rational (they are emotional most of the time).

Individuals do not always make the most logical decisions, they are often driven by fear, greed or individual situations that can not be measured or known. These individuals, who are part of what they call the ""market,"" do not always have all the ""market"" information and are often misled by the price system (some caused by the state, others not).

"The Real Manipulation of Crypto 2018, Outlined.","  

This entire downward trajectory and war on crypto started with Bill Gates, February 28th saying ""cryptocurrency kills in a fairly directly way"" in a reddit AMA. Previously Bill has been very positive on bitcoin. Microsoft has accepted it for years. It wasn't priced in psychologically as it lingered until **March 7th**. The day in which there was fake news about a Binance hack which never existed.

March we had Google banning ads **MARCH 14TH**.  Then you had Facebook ban ads one week. YouTube the next, Twitter the next. Taking their time to suppress further and further.

Then in May we had Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Charles Munger interviewed on CNBC. Attacking relentlessly. It was one of the 1st questions in the interview with 3 very important people in finance as they asked them collectively. If you don't think this was planned, please reevaluate. Interviews with people of this magnitude have pre-written questions that are approved ahead of time. The Federal Reserve openly attacking it publicly in May. Authorities looking into ""price manipulation"". When the only price manipulation was the actual news about price manipulation.

After that it was probe ""cracking down"" on crypto. When they have had tools to track crypto for chain analysis for years. There's been a major piece of FUD news at least once a month for the past 7 months. Look at the charts for correlation. If you see a big dip, you will see there was FUD that day.  
 

South Korea ban **MARCH 6TH**, South Korea unban, South Korea exchange raids **MARCH 11TH**. China reiterating their ban. India ban **JULY 3RD**, India unban, India ban. SEC same cycle (has been + lately). CFTC same cycle. Russia same cycle.

I would love to hear your opinion on these...,"[Source : Ali Al Shamsi- Quora]

1. Almost all major advertising outlets like Google and Facebook highly restricted crypto ads. So lower adoption rate and no more booming growth.

2. Governments caught up with the ”craze” and want some. So tons of taxation laws are now in place when crypto were supposed to be tax haven. Losing that appeal.

3. Crypto crash happened and trust in it at its lowest so no more gold rush.

4. It is fairly complicated now to buy or sell crypto via exchanges or even getting any anyway. So not helping with adoption rate.

5. Media is all doom and gloom about crypto. They love to hate it so more bad reputation and less adoption.",1536480817,09/09/2018 08:13:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ebhqw/i_would_love_to_hear_your_opinion_on_these/,1

Will I need to have money in order to receive money?

Opening a LN channel with a poor person seems stupid!

A poor person can't relay your payments.
A poor person can't be used for money to reach you, or pass through you.
The money you put in a channel with him is locked untill that person receives money somehow.

ebay + paypal at their finest,"I usually don't sell things on ebay, I prefer sites like craiglist or subito (the italian craiglist), you met the buyer, complete the transaction and ""Ciao, Ciao"".  


But this time i said *""Ok this item is not so popular, maybe is better increase possibilities to sell it, let's go on ebay""*, after three days i sold my item for 45€, that became 43,12€ after paypal's fee, **that became 0 the day after** cause with a new e-mail ebay blocked my funds for 21 days for **unexpected activity.**

I'm not a superfan of bitcoin, i follow the community to keep myself update and stop, but this thing bother me so much, because they (ebay) touched and frozen my money, and remove them from my (virtual) pocket, and nowadays seems that no one care about these things, even our money aren't **OUR**  anymore.

Why is everyone so frustrated about current price? There is much bigger picture not everyone is seeing.,"I know you got in at 15k and ended up with 50% less or whatever. So what? If u look at past it did that ALL the time. I got a job first time 2 months ago and in and in about a month I will start getting surplus cash which ALL of it goes into BTC. The more it falls the more I can buy, honestly I get frustrated when it rises because there is FOMO and nothing I can do. 

We all know next or second big wave that comes bitcoin will BOOM TO THE MOON when it gets high to another levels and/or by the time there is another financial crisis millionares and billionares will realise that it is time leave the old broken system and to get as much as possible of 1 of 21 mil and put assets into safest place in the world. 

I don't worry about becoming millionare because we all know we are on the way for sure, I worry about the time it will take to destroy root of all evil, banks. It will take some time but it will happen, when our children start taking over the world and old farts like Warren Buffett go to their resting place. 

It is time for the world to stop living paycheck to paycheck and start evolving things like electric cars, renewable energy, AI, quantum computers, VR, leaving simple jobs to autonomus robots. It is time once and for all that we all come together and do our best to contribute to this world, not try to be better than others but to share, help, love and respect.

I want the BTC ideally.  However, it's only a claim, they are not saying I'll necessarily get this amount.

"No, Bitcoin Doesn’t Have To Be Lightning Fast And Cheap. Here’s why.","Many people talk about how slow and expensive Bitcoin is, but this doesn’t mean that Bitcoin is a bad cryptocurrency, and here’s why.

While it is true that Bitcoin may be slower and more expensive than other cryptocurrencies, this doesn’t have to be a huge issue. There is a huge misunderstanding of Bitcoin by the public as well as cryptocurrency communities. People don’t understand the use of Bitcoin, or they simply exaggerate this  non-existent problem. Bitcoin may be slower, or more expensive, but this is an advantage of Bitcoin, not a disadvantage.

### The Use Of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin wasn’t designed by Satoshi to get around PayPal fees or to buy coffee at Starbucks. He has a much bigger vision for Bitcoin, and that’s what people miss. Sure, a $5 tx fee is ridiculous for buying a coffee, but a $5 tx fee for transferring millions across the ocean is a drop in the bucket.

If you’re purchasing a house, you don’t need extremely low fees or even lightning fast transaction fees. That’s what Bitcoin was meant to be for. Bitcoin was meant for big things, not microtransactions.

That’s what many people don’t see in Bitcoin. While everyone likes to complain about how expensive Bitcoin is to use, that’s all relative. It’s definitely one of the cheaper options for large transactions.

Furthermore, people living in western democracies may not see the use of Bitcoin. We have systems such as banks and ATMs that make transactions easy. Our currencies are stable, so it doesn’t seem like there’s a point of Bitcoin. But in the developing world, sending money is a painful and difficult process. Not to mention the hyper-inflation going on in developing countries. This is where Bitcoin really comes in, and shows that Bitcoin isn’t useless or a scam.

### Still Better Than USD.

Bitcoin doesn’t have to be perfect to take over the world. It just has to be better than USD, and it will see mass adoption. Another example of this is with self-driving cars. They don’t have to be 100% accident free. As a long as self-driving cars kill less people than human drivers, they are beneficial and will see mass adoption. Or even the simplest of examples. When running away from a bear, you don’t have to be faster than the bear; you just have to be faster than the slowest person.

"No, Bitcoin Doesn’t Have To Be Lightning Fast And Cheap. Here’s why.","Many people talk about how slow and expensive Bitcoin is, but this doesn’t mean that Bitcoin is a bad cryptocurrency, and here’s why.

While it is true that Bitcoin may be slower and more expensive than other cryptocurrencies, this doesn’t have to be a huge issue. There is a huge misunderstanding of Bitcoin by the public as well as cryptocurrency communities. People don’t understand the use of Bitcoin, or they simply exaggerate this  non-existent problem. Bitcoin may be slower, or more expensive, but this is an advantage of Bitcoin, not a disadvantage.

### The Use Of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin wasn’t designed by Satoshi to get around PayPal fees or to buy coffee at Starbucks. He has a much bigger vision for Bitcoin, and that’s what people miss. Sure, a $5 tx fee is ridiculous for buying a coffee, but a $5 tx fee for transferring millions across the ocean is a drop in the bucket.

If you’re purchasing a house, you don’t need extremely low fees or even lightning fast transaction fees. That’s what Bitcoin was meant to be for. Bitcoin was meant for big things, not microtransactions.

That’s what many people don’t see in Bitcoin. While everyone likes to complain about how expensive Bitcoin is to use, that’s all relative. It’s definitely one of the cheaper options for large transactions.

Furthermore, people living in western democracies may not see the use of Bitcoin. We have systems such as banks and ATMs that make transactions easy. Our currencies are stable, so it doesn’t seem like there’s a point of Bitcoin. But in the developing world, sending money is a painful and difficult process. Not to mention the hyper-inflation going on in developing countries. This is where Bitcoin really comes in, and shows that Bitcoin isn’t useless or a scam.

### Still Better Than USD.

Bitcoin doesn’t have to be perfect to take over the world. It just has to be better than USD, and it will see mass adoption. Another example of this is with self-driving cars. They don’t have to be 100% accident free. As a long as self-driving cars kill less people than human drivers, they are beneficial and will see mass adoption. Or even the simplest of examples. When running away from a bear, you don’t have to be faster than the bear; you just have to be faster than the slowest person.

Bitcoin is already superior to USD, with its deflationary aspect, and how versatile it is. Currently, sending USD around the world is a slow process, but Bitcoin is faster. While it may not be instant, it is still far better than the slow transaction speeds of wire transfers and other transfers.

There’s billions of dollars invested into these transaction companies such as Western Union. When people see that Bitcoin is a cheaper and faster alternative, Bitcoin is going to see mass adoption.

Bitcoin $BTC Approaching All Time High Short Interest Levels,"Recent analysis shows Bitcoin short interest being near all time highs. For any beginners, short interest is best defined as parties that are betting against Bitcoin (winning if the price goes down). This means traders/investors originally ""borrow bitcoin"" at a higher price and then hope to cash out when Bitcoin goes down and ""sell"" their borrowed Bitcoin. Simply stated, traders/investors acquire Bitcoin at current prices and then sell at lower prices. 

An example would be: Investor shorts Bitcoin at 7K, borrowing a certain amount of Bitcoin at 7K - Bitcoin then goes to 6,500 and the short seller cashes out. They use the borrowed bitcoin to now buy back in at 6,500 (making a 500 profit on each bitcoin). 

&amp;#x200B;

The market is viewing short interest levels as both negative and positive. On the downside, investors never like to see something being heavily shorted. It signals weakness in the market for various reasons. On the flip side, all of these short sellers have to ""cover"" eventually meaning cashing out and buying bitcoin at current market prices. Historically high levels of short interest eventually result in upward momo once all the shorts begin to cover their initial positions. Please view the attached photo to see short interest approaching all time highs.

EXCLUSIVE: Satoshi Nakamoto was killed by FBI in 2012,"Christopher Steele (UK) gave the CSIS a report that claims the 2012 death of Satoshi Nakamoto was the result of poisoning by FBI.

The alleged murder of the Bitcoin founder took place days before SN was supposed to meet with CSIS.

According to a report given to the CSIS, the death of a major crypto player was not an accident.

The report was apparently written by Christopher Steele, who is most famous for writing a dossier about President Donald Trump's alleged ties to Russia that was released in January of last year.

Steele had been a trusted source for the FBI and it remains unclear how federal authorities used his information.

CSIS agent who spoke with the publication said it was no secret within the Service that FBI had been behind his murder. A former CIA intelligence officer echoed the agent's statement.

Key facts from Steele's report: ""...certainly reinvestigate should additional evidence be brought to light..."".

SN's death took place just before he was slated to sit down for an interview with the CSIS, which wanted to speak to him about his story.

Three other individuals besides Steele told the FBI killed SN.

Bitcoin will not stop inflation,"While the method of how BTC is independent of a 'Board' or controlling party (Fed, IMF, etc.) and eventually will be capped at the 21 mark that will not stop inflation. I agree however it will limit inflation to a significant degree by removing those manipulative factors. It will be a market driven inflation, as it should be.
A key factor in inflation is the age old proven supply and demand principle.  Proverbial example would be if there is only one loaf of bread left on the shelf then the person with more BTC will pay a higher price for at loaf raising the price of bread.  Likewise if everyone is looking for a house but there are only a few homes for sale. The price of these homes will increase. 
Just want to make sure we stay grounded in our expectations for the future. We will still have to compete for better paying jobs and earn more coin to buy the most toys in the neighborhood.

Announcing IranbyBit. We use bitcoin primarily to provide services for tourists who want to visit Iran.," IranbyBit is a tourism Business which offers services, especially ecotourism based services to travelers and adventurer who wants to visit Iran. We also accept Bitcoin.  
The main idea of the business comes from the sanctions on Iran. We are cut off from the financial system and this prevents us from doing financial transactions with customers from other countries. Travelers who want to visit Iran are not able to use credit cards, such as Visa Card, MasterCard to book a place or pay their expenses in Iran. Here at IranbyBit we seized the opportunity provided by Bitcoin to solve the tourism problems in Iran concerning tourists who had to carry cash.

Regulation the only way to SAVE Bitcoin.,"Whales come and smash everyone any way they want. The market has become a circus and a joke for the small investor/medium. I am in the hodl gang and will continue holding but I feel it is in the interest of Bitcoin and the crypto markets that US and other govts begin controlling the whale manipulation on Bitmex and other platforms. US govt can force these exchanges and platforms to self regulate or face sanction. Any manipulative activity should be monitored and account owners face investigation. Unless we do this how can SEC or anybody in their right minds ever approve of an ETF for this madness? No govt, financial institution or business would ever consider investing and building upon the market if whales control everything top to bottom.

Well I lost almost Every dollar although be it on paper.  I changed my strategy end of July and decided to buy on the dips sell on the Green Day’s and buy on the red ones. I was losing sleep waiting for the turns. I was noticing a pattern of Friday’s Sunday’s and Monday’s. 

I ended up building my portfolio back around to around 30k. Unfortunately it’s a lot of work and I do have a day job. All I’m saying is choose your own investment strategy that works for you. What you can afford and what fits in your lifestyle. 

You can make money in this market doesn’t have to be green every day. I was so close to giving up many times as well as last week and then I saw a huge drop re bought in and will prob sell later tonight and pickup another 5%

Can we talk about Nick Szabo?,"The guy's supposed to be a genius, one of a few ever mentioned by Satoshi, yet he spends his day retweeting conservative pro-trump crap? For example, he just retweeted:

  
"" As a Marine &amp; supporter of law enforcement, it sickens me to see [~~@~~**Nike**](https://twitter.com/Nike)'s ads on my timeline promoting [~~#~~**Kaepernick**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kaepernick?src=hash)'s self-absorbed ""sacrifice"".  What an insult to all of the men &amp; women who died in the line of duty &amp; never came home to their families.  They sacrificed EVERYTHING. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously? Some of you think this guy is Satoshi?

Every sane person I know realizes that deaths like that of Tamir Rice or Philando Castile are far too common and can only be fixed from within our terrible policing system, while simultaneously realizing Nike is no saint for selling this bs while still exploiting foreign sweat shops, they're no better. Picking sides means you don't see the big picture. In less kind words, it means you're an idiot.

I saw that there's been some discussion of this in the past, with people saying they will judge him for his contributions, not his stance, but with everything we've seen from this administration (separating kids from their parents and literally refusing to return them, I can't even keep track of who is getting arrested when from his cabinet, the whole ""drain the swamp"" thing where he admitted he was only saying that to rally his audience, this list could go on for god knows how long) it's like I completely understand ignoring it all, but you're going to STAND BEHIND IT?

Let's bring Luke Dashjr into the discussion. I've long unfollowed him for his stances on ""correct"" marriage, abortion, religion in general. As someone who studied Christianity since birth, I can guarantee you that this religion teaches fear. They pretend they teach love, but that's the superficial. The end goal is to not go to hell no matter what, it is the ultimate fear of a christian, all their decisions are made with this fear in mind.

To me, supporting this administration shows the same type of fear derived from ignorance. 

I just wanted to get this all off my chest after seeing one too many idiotic retweets from szabo. I don't want everyone to shun them or anything, just be aware of what we really want to see from those we're going to be naming pioneers of this movement",1536537077,09/09/2018 23:51:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ehqf7/can_we_talk_about_nick_szabo/,1

Bitcoin and it’s potential,"I’ve been here for almost a year and like many others heard of bitcoin before but never really gave it any thought.
Except during the Mt. Gox crash almost invested in mining hardware, but due to certain circumstances did not.

In this year I already read every book Andreas wrote and mostly on Quora about its “groundbreaking possibilities” and following its news and development on Ln.

However I’m stuck at imagining how Bitcoin in its current form can develop any further besides “the currency of the internet”. 
What other possibilities can it fulfill, where does it go’s beside a speculative asset/currency?

If I look at today’s use of Bitcoin it’s more of a day trading and or “hodling” mechanism in hopes of acquiring large amount of fiat by longing and/or shorting.

Is there still a core of users who use it as it was intended (a currency) and is this number growing and if not isn’t this what could kill BItcoin?

Are there any conspiracy among world governments against Bitcoin?,"Not likely. However, the initial state of bewilderment mixed with fear towards Bitcoin is now changed to a widely shared by most authorities desire to keep it under the control (to nobody's surprise, of course). Most world governments are choosing among three major decisions: to allow further Bitcoin existence in the regulatory vacuum and under the constant threat of sudden repressions, to introduce a stringent set of regulations, which impose a costly AML and KYC burden on all financial intermediaries dealing with Bitcoin or to ban it completely. It looks, however, like that the smaller is a country - the less repressive is its legislation towards Bitcoin. Here’s an example of Mongolia: 

 The [Bank of Mongolia](https://www.mongolbank.mn/eng/)'s relatively tolerant view on Bitcoin was expressed in a public memorandum [МЭДЭГДЭЛ](https://www.mongolbank.mn/news.aspx?id=1703&amp;tid=1) (or ""Declaration"") dated back to September 29, 2017. It said [*The Law on the National Payment System defines a non-cash payment instrument (5.1.25) ""e-money"" as a Mongolian currency ... (and) does not include (Bitcoin). ... We declare that (Bitcoin) is not regulated by official (laws) and is not considered (to be) an official payment instrument.*](https://www.mongolbank.mn/news.aspx?id=1703&amp;tid=1)

That had left Bitcoin completely on the wild in Mongolia for almost a year until, in April 2018, there appeared an information that BOM approved a set of regulations, which purpose is ""[*... to create legal environment of coordination of (Bitcoin) and its activities which has been defined in the Law on National Payment System, and to protect customers through establishing safe and reliable digital currency system. The regulation defines who will participate in digital currency system and how, process of getting permission, rights and duties of customers and service providers. It also expected to support further development of FinTech technology and payment system.*](http://www.montsame.mn/en/read/14712)*""*

 As to details contained in this ""Regulation"" they are still remain unrevealed. We can only guess that as a result of this ""establishing safe and reliable digital currency system"" Mongolian Bitcoin-holders will be subjected to a centralized monitoring. However, we, certainly, must congratulate Mongolian Bitcoin-enthusiasts with that their country is not joining the rank of states - Bitcoin-haters. 

Business Notes for Bitcoin Startups Founders:

* political climate: relatively friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: locally;
* industries to focus: mobile apps, e-commerce, e-jobs, entertainments, FinTech;
* major limitations: slowing GDP growth (under 4%), low-wage (around $300/ month), low-density population (1.3 person per square kilometer), progressive tax system (ranging from 10% to 25%), low Internet penetration rate, administrative hurdles, shortage of qualified personnel, absence of seed and VC capitals;
* stimulus: low costs and absence of competition;
* opportunities: to develop niche e-services in non-English-speaking Internet.
* Bitcoin: unregulated (positive).

Arbitrage trading and how to benefit from it,"
I used the price difference between the exchanges:

\- Current rate at [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com/): $6500

\- Current rate at [BTC-A-Trade](https://btcatrade.com/): $7215






Steps:


1. I sold  [13.41644771 bitcoins](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1NeaaxtvLQ7vMF9e9Ri5h7LDYDcgLDmpUL) at BTC-A-Trade and I got [$96K payout](https://pasteboard.co/HCSmcif.png)
2. 10 minutes later I bought the same amount of bitcoins for $87K at Coinbase, 
3. = which leaves me with $9000 profit.

Crypto Wipeout Deepens to $640 Billion as Ether Leads Declines," 

The cryptocurrency bear market plumbed a fresh 10-month low after Bitcoin’s biggest rival tumbled and U.S. regulators [suspended trading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-09/bitcoin-tracker-one-and-ether-tracker-one-suspended-by-u-s-sec) in two securities linked to digital assets.

Ether, the second-largest virtual currency, slumped 8.9 percent from its level at 5 p.m. New York time on Friday, according to Bloomberg composite pricing. Bitcoin lost 2.1 percent, while the market capitalization of digital assets tracked by CoinMarketCap.com shrank to $197 billion -- down about $640 billion from its January peak.

&amp;#x200B;

 Cryptocurrencies have declined for five of the past six weeks amid concern that a broader adoption of digital assets will take longer than some had anticipated. That worry was underscored over the weekend after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily [suspended trading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-09/bitcoin-tracker-one-and-ether-tracker-one-suspended-by-u-s-sec) in two exchange-traded notes linked to cryptocurrencies and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin told Bloomberg that the days of explosive [growth ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-08/crypto-growth-nears-ceiling-ethereum-co-founder-buterin-says)in the blockchain industry have likely come and gone.

Localbitcoins.com Scam - Alert,"I have been using [LocalBitcoins.com](https://LocalBitcoins.com) for a year, i used to respect them and trust them.

I had a similar issue with Binance and they solved it and took a fee same week, but LBC refused to solve it and lied that they do not have a private key to use on their side to get the USDT.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my client transferred $5,000 USDT to one of my LocalBitcoins BTC addresses by mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

From the start I thought that it’s not a problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am pure technical guy and I know that USDT protocol is based on Bitcoin blockchain and if you have a private key from BTC address you can withdraw USDT from it.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a ticket and spend several days on negotiations with a LocalBitcoins support team.

&amp;#x200B;

I was disappointed so much with the company, coz I understood they don’t want to get me my money back.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone with experience in blockchain will understand that USDT can be retrieved again from a BTC wallet if they want to, 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead the company I used to trust started giving me newbie false information. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 - They said they do not have the private key of their wallet, how come and it is a web based wallet that they manage, they have the key and they can easily use it to get my USDT back and send it back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - They said my BTC wallet has no USDT inside it, and this is technically a lie because I have here the OmniExplorer link and it is clearly saying my money is there.

&amp;#x200B;

I even sent them a technical guide how to get the USDT from MY WALLET that they control, but they rejected it.

&amp;#x200B;

So by logic I came to a conclusion they are trying to make me stop asking for hard earned money of my client.

&amp;#x200B;

How it is possible: famous and honorable crypto exchange with 

multimillionaire volumes prefers to scam and lose the client which has trusted to them and the price of their honor is only $5,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably hundreds of users are doing same mistakes every months. And all stollen funds are stored on LocalBitcoins wallets till the final exit scam of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear LocalBitcoins team, these funds will not make you happier, your Karma is bad and it’s a shame on you.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t advise to anyone to use LocalBitcoins services if you don’t want to lose all your funds one day when the company will decide to do the final exit scam.",1536590370,10/09/2018 14:39:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9enq17/localbitcoinscom_scam_alert/,1

5. Hash it again.

"If online wallets require identification, what does that mean for offline wallet users?","I wanted to get onto bitcoin, so I joined an online bitcoin service. I then found that they required a whole lot of identification, including a photo of me holding up an ID. I didn't want to continue with this so I looked for other options.

Im still deciding on whether installing a full node (I have the storage and internet connection to do so), or just a light wallet such as Electrum.

Ive been review app reviews, and if I was to simply buy some bitcoins at a bitcoin ATM, and used either Bitcoin-core or Electrum, then my bitcoin transactions, could essentially be completely anonymous. (I could even purchase bitcoins at an ATM wearing heavy disguise, and connect to Electrum servers using TOR, and it literally be completely anonymous)

I dont intend for complete anonymity (I just dont want the whole hassle of sending off pictures of myself to some online bitcoin service, but it shows that one could easily enter the bitcoin market without any identification at all.

Online wallets require such strict identification verification, whilst offline wallets can be done without any identification whatsoever.

So I'm a little worried that I may be breaking some laws by using offline wallets. Can someone please clear this up for me? What am I missing? Why is there such a difference between online wallet verification, and DIY bitcoin usage?",1536600807,10/09/2018 17:33:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ep8tl/if_online_wallets_require_identification_what/,1

I sent letters to top newspapers asking for Lightning Network micropayments. Here are their responses so far.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ch8f923lsgl11.png

 Hello fellow Steemians and Crypto Investors,

The following is a combined version of the letters I sent to the most  circulated newspapers that are currently behind paywalls asking for  Lightning Network micro-payments.

*Subject: Implement Lightning Network micro-payments and tear down these walls!*

Hello Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, New York Times and many others,

I'm not going to pay $15 to $30 dollars a month for a subscription!  These subscriptions add up and I'm only interested in a few of the  articles anyway, not a full subscription. I would be way more likely to  pay a few cents for a particular article I'm interested in.

Why don't you implement Lightning Network micro-payments? You will  get a lot more revenue, a lot of hype from the crypto and millennial  communities and, most importantly, look cool and like keeping up with  the times. You can always maintain the old subscriptions, just give an  option for advanced users to micro-pay for articles.

It's frustrating whenever an interesting article from your website  appears on my Flipboard feed but you can only get to the paywall. I have  Eclair wallet installed and ready to micro-pay for it but the option is  not yet available.

Conversion rates on the subscription pages are likely very low. If  you could capture even a small percent of all those readers you are  currently losing revenues would increase dramatically and you can do it  without removing the current subscription model. It could be as simple  as a link saying ""Buy this article for 20 cents"", something like that.  20 cents doesn't sound like much but when they add up, especially  because your paywall rejects are way more numerous than subscribers. You  could also charge more for Breaking News and Exclusives.

I'd love to see journalism return to high profitability and thus be  able to afford the investigative teams and resources it badly needs and  also cryptocurrency micro-payments take off. I believe it's a match made  in heaven!

Get in touch with Coingate, they are piloting a gateway for these  kinds of micro-payments. (I'm not affiliated in any way with them. I  just think micro-payments are cool and use them for other services such  as Satoshis Place and Lightning Spin)

**Their responses so far:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Washington Post (****help@washpost.com****):**

&gt;“We have sent the comments to relevant departments”  
 

**Wall Street Journal (****support@wsj.com****):**

&gt;“We have taken the liberty of forwarding your comments to upper management“  
 

**Financial Times (****help@ft.com****):**

&gt;“You have a good point in suggesting Lightning Network micro-payments  in which customers can use if they want to read an interesting article  on ft.com. We take onboard your suggestion and hopefully one of the  things that our marketing teams would consider.”  
 

&amp;#x200B;

**You can help by sending your own letters to their following public customer service emails addresses:** **help@washpost.com****,** **support@wsj.com** **and** **help@ft.com**

**Have you sent similar letters to other online service providers asking for Micro-Payments? Which ones?**

**Do you believe micropayments can save journalism by making it  profitable again without controlling sponsors, ads, and dreaded  paywalls?**

My first impressions on getting paid through Bitwage,"I made the decision a few weeks back to start taking a percentage of my paycheck through Bitwage. Going in, there was honestly not as much coverage on Bitwage in this subreddit as I thought there would be, but their support team was pretty timely in answering my questions through email, and also seem to be fairly active on reddit which is a definite plus in my book.


It took a bit of time to get everything sorted with my company's payroll, and the Bitwage GUI can be a little confusing at time, but once again the Bitwage support team was helpful in answering my questions.


I, like many US employees, am paid every other Friday. Payroll usually processes my direct deposit into my checking account just before midnight on Thursday just prior. 


Bitwage received my deposit at around 4am on Friday morning. I knew going in that to expect a delay of around 1 day for the conversion to BTC, but what I didn't realize until later was that I should expect 1 *business* day. For a currency whose exchanges operate 24/7, I find that to be a bit of a bummer, though I suppose I can deal. Plus, there was a pretty significant drop in the price of Bitcoin from Thursday night going into the weekend, so I suppose I sort of lucked out there.


My Bitcoin purchase finally completed at around 8am this morning, true to the one business day time frame, I suppose, but a long time to sit and worry watching the market change in between.


The Bitcoin arrived in my wallet in a timely fashion, but my exchange rate was $6534.13 USD/BTC -- significantly higher than any price we've yet seen today for BTC. 


I'm going to stick with it for a few more pay periods and see how things go, but I'm starting to think I might be better off just scheduling bi-weekly purchases through Coinbase. 


Just my two cents -- thought I'd share.

&amp;#x200B;

The Twitter user Nunya Bizniz published an image in which it is possible to see Bitcoin’s price between 2013 and 2018 and Gold’s price from 1976 until today. The similarities are completely shocking. 

 

The twitter user said that both charts had an ""uncanny"" resemblance using a log scale. Clearly, the gold chart has a longer time frame, but the results are surprisingly similar. 

 

Some time ago, the famous US economist Paul Krugman, said that Bitcoin has more utility than gold. Indeed, he explained that gold is dead and that Bitcoin has more utility than gold. 

 

""There is some chance for Bitcoin to be valuable in the future,"" he stated. ",1536622352,10/09/2018 23:32:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9es9oi/bitcoin_and_gold_have_nearly_identical_price/,1

Looking for help with bitcoin wallet and transfer issues? Especially if you're in Boston please!,"I have some bitcoin stuck in a shitty wallet on my phone, so I can't withdraw or transfer it... I think I could fix it myself but would much rather be safe with my money than risk loosing it. I believe it's because my wallet offers the lowest possible amount in fees for miners, so the low pay means the transaction is never handled... I think. Really not sure though! Anyone super familiar with bitcoin and bitcoin transfers that could help me, or refer me to someone? I'm currently attending uni in Boston so preferably someone who is in Boston that I could maybe meet up with to show and talk about it? Also best to meet you for a little trustworthyness haha.

Then I take out the ones, and the fives,  and the pennies, and I get all confused because I'm not good at addition and subtraction. I'm too busy wondering why there is coke and aids on my money. 

         People don't even want real coins anymore. Unless they are really old. The coins not the people. Bitcoin is pretty knew. I barely know anything about bitcoin. But I barely know anything about anything so thats not a good reason not to buy it. Reasons to buy it. Decentralized currency, Less corruption, Feed the poor. I'll buy people things like food.

How does blockchain technology serve self-driving travel?,"Blockchain technology serves the financial, gaming, medical and other fields. Travel is no exception. The blockchain tourism is strong, and the blockchain technology has cracked the pain point of the tourism industry, which has become the consensus of the industry.

As a form of tourism, self-driving tour is different from the tour group of the bus as a means of transportation. It refers to the tourism activity in which the self-driving motor vehicle is the main mode of transportation. The rise of self-driving tour not only conforms to the psychology of the younger generation to pursue personality independence and freedom of mind, but also a form of tourism that will inevitably emerge under the times, market and technology call. At the moment when the current experience of the delegation is getting worse and worse, self-driving tour has gradually become one of the main choices for travel.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1mv0somftkl11.jpg

At present, the blockchain technology has touched the branch of the tourism industry “self-driving tour”. Then, the blockchain technology has landed on self-driving tourism. How do you serve self-driving tour?

First, the integration of tourism information on the blockchain makes it convenient for self-driving passengers to share reliable and feasible data. For example, LEOOY is a decentralized new blockchain tourism platform built with the blockchain technology framework, covering a wide range of businesses. LEOOY organizes, aggregates and trusts stranger transactions and unorganized scenes through blockchain intelligent contracts to form an information network on the chain. Finally, it is convenient for self-driving users to inquire valuable information and improve tourists' self-driving travel. The experience in the process.

Second, based on blockchain technology to serve driving related things. Self-driving can not leave the vehicle. There are many kinds of cars, and they are inseparable from licenses and driver's licenses. Recently, according to foreign media reports, Australia's New South Wales has released a digital driver license based on blockchain. The license, supported by the NSW government, is expected to be available nationwide by the end of 2019, when block-based technology digital driving licenses and digital photo cards will be offered to citizens across the state.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uhsn0x9itkl11.png

The digital driver's license is placed on the blockchain to better allow people to find information in a more transparent way. This measure not only saved manpower and material costs, prevented tampering, improved efficiency, but also promoted the implementation of self-driving tour.

Third, reduce the cost of personalized experience. Since the first China Self-driving Tour Summit Forum in 2006, self-driving tour has been around for 12 years. Due to the relatively high threshold and high price of self-driving tourism, the time cost of completing a self-driving tour is relatively high, which is why most passengers who travel by car need to have strong economic strength. However, this also limits the popularity of self-driving tour. With the addition of blockchain technology, blockchain travel platforms such as LEOOY rely on blockchain technology to provide one-stop solutions to design routes, integrate resources, and efficiently process orders with reduced links and decentralized management. In the end, it saves costs for self-driving users.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2m6roxtktkl11.jpg

With the improvement of people's economic living standards, self-driving tour has become a way of leisure experience. Since it is a casual experience, it pays special attention to the actual feelings in tourism. The blockchain enters the branch of “self-driving tourism” in tourism, and the self-driving tour “touch chain” is the embodiment of the smooth development of blockchain tourism.

Simple Program to accept BITCOIN and other crypto payments,"Hello folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to share with you one of my project,

it's a Python script to accept cryptocurrencies payment for website owner.

The program is very simple, It basically allow the website owner to  creates DEPOSIT wallets for USERS or CLIENTS, and save them into a  DATABASE.

It works with all the coins that use a BITCOIN core clone wallet client. The code published is based on CLAM coin.

I'm going to add new codes to this repository, to manage transactions  to hot wallet, and to allow withdrawals to USERS or CLIENTS EXTERNAL  WALLETS.

You need a local wallet installed an sync on your computer or on the server. It uses subprocess library to call, and execture che -cli WALLET CONSOLE commands.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin divisibles,"We already have Sats and Bits but can we agree on another usable divisible? I hate counting the zeros its confusing as hell and I always make mistakes

0.01 BTC = X?

0.01 X = 10k Bits / 1m sat (million satoshis)


Personally I actually find ""Bits"" pointless because its easy to just say ""100 sat"" or even ""10k sat"", but it would be useful to have a name for 0.01 BTC. Then theres 1 million sats in an ""X"" which is much easier to visualise, especially considering 1 X would be worth ~$6.30(rn) which is just about over pint and a bag of crisps at some hotel, whereas 1 bit is currently like, not even noteworthy

I don't like ""mBTC"" because it doesnt roll off the tongue and has too many piddly little 0s, its a pain in the arse",1536662612,11/09/2018 10:43:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ewexv/bitcoin_divisibles/,1

BTC Blockchain download (bootstrap.dat),"\[Google translate\] :-)

  
I wanted to set up a full node on my Raspberry and faced the problem of Blockchain Synronization. Unfortunately, I found in the network only a few pages where you could download the Blockchain standalone. Either you had to pay or it was the torrent story. 

Long story short. I would like to provide the Bitcoin Blockchain (bootstrap.dat) as a ""one click"" solution to the community here. It is updated once a week, every Monday. 

I appreciate feedback for further development.

MATTHIAS METI BEYER JOINS DESTREAM AS ADVISOR,"* **The DeStream project is delighted to announce that the eminent gaming industry specialist Matthias Beyer has joined the Advisory Board and   will be lending his experience to the development of the platform.**
* **Matthias   Meti Beyer is an experienced regional director with successful history working in video game industry. Mainly focused on content, influencer and esports business. He is an invaluable addition to the DeStream   project, considering his extensive experience of working at Twitch as a   Director of Content in Southeast Asia, where he developed and lead  content acquisition strategies in the major 6 countries,**  
**sponsorship   efforts for events, esports leagues, studios and professional esports teams, and localized the company’s core values and practices into  region  with vastly different economics.**
* **Matthias’   extensive experience in negotiations and working knowledge of the  Southeast Asian market are of immense importance to the DeStream   project, which seeks to establish a strong foothold in one of the most   dynamically developing markets for streamers and consumers of their   content.**
* **DeStream   has a vision, which is to develop an infrastructure that will simplify  the process of creating content for talented streamers, allowing them  to  interact with viewers and conduct financial transactions, thus  becoming  an integral part of this market that is slated to become the  main  source of content for the next generations. In fact, DeStream is   striving to transform this sector of the economy and take it to a new   level of development. Together, we will be able to discover and foster   new talents with various creative backgrounds, since the main problem of   talented people is the lack of money for promotion.**
* **The   advantages DeStream offers over existing resources are beyond anything   streamers could have dreamed before, and include such features as a  single access point for streamers/viewers/advertisers, a significant   decrease of transaction costs (up to 0.77%) and the possibility of paying for streaming platform services directly through the DeStream   platform. Other advantages include the use of a single overlay hub and   the possibility of creating individual smart contracts with unique algorithms for advanced users, as well as the possibility of trading virtual items in the domestic marketplace and on affiliate platforms. DeStream is striving to provide enormous opportunities for the  integration of streaming platforms, ensuring their development and  extension of their functionality, as a single gateway for accepting any  cryptocurrency will simplify conversion to any available currencies,   while smart contracts will ensure the implementation of the terms of   transactions.**
* **The   DeStream project is delighted to have a specialist like Matthias Beyer   onboard and is certain that his addition to the team as an Advisor  will  help ensure fruitful cooperation with the Asian community and will  help  solidify DeStream’s positions on the market.**

Why is it so difficult for me to give away crypto?,"I've been building a really cool community at [Coinfeed](https://coinfeed.com/) that will be supported by a cornucopia of analysis tools. Right now I think we have one of the best news engines that pulls from over 100 sources and trims out 90% of the garbage (saves a shit load of time). Some of the other tools being developed are based on my years working as a quant on the trade floor for commodities trading firms.

I’d characterize the community as one that’s eager to learn and eager to contribute. We have some really cool people in there including doctors, entrepreneurs, professional miners, a Jimmy Song-trained/Consensys-trained blockchain/dapp developer, and even a few down-to-earth youtube influencers (they’re on the app so won’t name drop).

But here’s the thing. I want to give away $10 worth of BTC or Nano (member's choice) each day to one new member that joins as a promotion for all of 2018 (app is freemium). I’ve come to realize that this sounds incredibly scammy no matter how I reword it. It’s not a scam however, just a simple promotion. Like a real one. I sent Louis (the community manager for NANO) a Facebook message to see if I can post my promo in his group. (Never got a response and I can understand why).

Any social media managers out there, maybe you can help get the word out?

The app is called [Coinfeed](https://coinfeed.com/). I can’t wait to show off the features we have in store. Once we finish testing our market watch module, I fully feel we will give other apps (2.0 or not) a run for their money.

Usernames such as @John or @Rishi are still available. Hope to have you join our tribe.

My time horizon is forty years. Your mileage may vary.,"I am not in this for a quick buck.  I didn’t sell when the price was over $10,000 and I’m not selling now. Or ever.  

Bitcoin is the only self sovereign money in the world and for me it is to be acquired and spent, but never ever sold for fiat. 

Why?  Bitcoin has fundamental value and fiat does not.  Bitcoin has scarcity which fiat does not.  Bitcoin is permission-less and, unfortunately, fiat no longer is. Bitcoin is still new and the world is still discovering its value. The world is also rapidly discovering the lack of value in fiat. 

As bitcoin matures, as it survives every attack thrown at it, as more people discover it, bitcoin slowly causes a revolution towards sound money that is transmitable over the internet.  It is one of a kind. (Note that all other altcoins are not sound money.)

Although I could cash out and have enough fiat to last me for several years, my purchase of bitcoin was never to do that and I will not change the hypothesis behind why I originally bought bitcoin.

CNN is putting out misleading and biased information about cryptocurrency,"I thought I would raise awareness of this issue with the community.

CNN does not appreciate cryptocurrency. They have gone to such a degree as to put misleading point of views on their front page.

One point I would like to make is that CNN may be trying to make cryptocurrency and Bitcoin look like ""fool's gold"", just plain silly. In every single Bitcoin/crypto article published by CNN I have read, they have almost *always* brought up ""TrumpCoin"" and ""PotCoin"". And you know that marijuana is a drug perceived by the public akin to heroine/coke and, well, CNN just doesn't like Trump.

They also like to report more dumps that happen in the Bitcoin charts. Today, they published a ""I invested in Bitcoin and I lost all my money"" article again. It's just infuriating.

guidance on bitcoin for spending vs as an investment,"I understand that a wide group of people holding bitcoin long term greatly assists in the naturalization of bitcoin as the global currency.

Another important activity is actual use of bitcoin making and receiving payments.

Under current laws in most first world countries the latter activity is currently quite tedious because you must document your capital gains or losses for every purchase or sale. Andreas mentioned in the last year he spends more money on his tax accounting than he actually pays in taxes related to his bitcoin transactions.

Assuming I am now willing to take on this accounting burden I am now faced with an additional problem. I want to maintain my existing bitcoin holdings as an investment and purchase new bitcoin to begin transacting with. 

How can I as a private citizen separate my long term bitcoin investment, and it’s greater capital gains appreciation, from my new short term bitcoin purchasing for the purposes of discretionary household purchases? 

Is there a way to clearly define the two separate investment streams? Will tax authorities accept a last in first out approach, or will they demand a first in first out approach?",1536695421,11/09/2018 19:50:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9f0r8k/guidance_on_bitcoin_for_spending_vs_as_an/,1
"Explain: What is Lightning, how does it work, adopt now or when it has proven to be useful?","So I'm not new to bitcoin, but to be fair, I've been out of the scene for a bit and am now learning about this new lightning thing.

Someone told me its just a faster payment delivery method, then I hear people saying it's not as secure as the blockchain that BTC uses, so what gives?

Is the lightning network a gimmick or does it hold useful purpose? Is there as much of a security threat to my BTC wallet as people claim? If I adopt now, will I see any benefits of putting BTC into (as in, will it somehow make my wallet grow) it as opposed to waiting to see who has developed the best use for it?",1536695556,11/09/2018 19:52:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9f0rwi/explain_what_is_lightning_how_does_it_work_adopt/,1

is bitcoin adoption in Venezuela happening at a significant level?,"One value I see in bitcoin is that it can play the role of stable currency when a nation's fiat becomes too volatile. So I have imagined that adoption would become more globalized as third world countries were forced to use bitcoin when the economy collapses (like in Zimbabwe or currently in Venezuela). I just found an article which showed recent trading volume / week at 6000 btc = 130,000 $ which seems really small for a whole country.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this number close to what the volume is now and is it enough adoption to influence the btc market?

Scaling Lightning Network open/reload channel from mainnet,"Hi

One possibly valid(?) argument against LN I hear from Bcashers is that even with LN the current blocksize is still too small to support a few million people opening and reloading their lightning channels from mainnet funds with a reasonable fee or time.

How is this meant to be solved? 

\- Is it so far in the future that we might actually increase the block size a bit anyway when the time comes? 

\- Is the purpose that ""normal"" users never touch mainnet and will open/reload channels by buying funds from a player that already has channels with alot of funds. Essentially a big ""LN Bank"".

&amp;#x200B;

Or is there something I am forgetting? :)

More thoughts on how this all works,"This is modified from a conversation with some BCash/multicoiners.

Decisions on scaling are made with either the goal of making it easier for people to run their own software or at least not make it harder, except for an existential threat. This directly takes away the power of the software developers to have the ability to control consensus. 

If I wanted to control the rules of bitcoin, and I had resources... I would see individuals running their own software as problem number one. I would attempt to solve this problem by increasing the cost of running a node and promote software that would allow the user to interface but not validate according to their own copy of the blockchain. I would increase the cost of running a node while simultaneously spinning up nodes of my own, increasing the percentage under my control. Eventually I will just collude with the final few businesses that are running nodes and we could then meet and choose the rules.

No there will not be a multicoin future.

Bitcoiners flock to the software developed by the people who make software that is able to be used by more people out there at a lower cost. It's nice to keep fees down, but the cost to run a full node is much more important. How much is decentralization and trustlessness worth? A lot. This is required for bitcoin to scale, as in the number of people running the software.

Not everyone who has knowledge of a private key is running the Bitcoin software, just FYI.

People run the software in their homes. They run it in their businesses. They run them in the cloud. They run it on satellites. These cypherpunk anarchist Austrian Economist normal people are what give bitcoin it's resistance to censorship and commitment to decentralization. To take over bitcoin, somebody would have to convince us to stop (not gonna happen) or kill or imprison us.

Making it more difficult for a user to trustlessly run his or her own software is not the way to a decentralized, cypherpunk, valuable, and fair (in the old way) monetary standard. 


The only objection I can think of that might make sense is to say that this is overkill, and that maybe a little trust is ok. 

I disagree for something as important as a monetary standard. We need maximum trust in the standard as it is the foundation of a healthy financial system.

We don't have to have lightning network to have sound money, but it's just icing on cake. Lightning network and open dime are early examples of many ways that Satoshis will be swapped for goods and services. Some methods will be good and some will be bad. Some will have specific use cases. Final settlement is on chain.

The more we can move things off chain, the lower the cost to run your own copy of the software and the harder it'll be for one person or group to control the rules because more individuals will be running it.",1536732328,12/09/2018 06:05:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9f56ic/more_thoughts_on_how_this_all_works/,1

"Coffee Wallet, my wallet/portfolio app, now supports BTC","G'day /r/bitcoin,

In the latest version of my open source application, ""Coffee Wallet"", I have enabled Bitcoin support.

I started this project to make order in a mess in my crypto assets and there were no applications available that would fit my needs. I wanted an app that is both a wallet and a blockchain portfolio. I can easily keep track on all my assets regardless of where I keep them but also accept and spend most popular coins on the go and have my portfolio updated instantly.

Here are some Coffee Wallet features worth mentioning:

* iOS and Android versions
* standard wallet features like QR code scanner, BIP72 payments, fingerprint authentication
* extra portfolio features like tracking an address or configuring price source
* ""send as a message"" feature that you can use to send small amounts of crypto to your friends, that do not have a wallet yet, using any medium
* simple paper wallets generator
* single BIP39 mnemonic for all wallets
* changelly.com integration lets you exchange coins without leaving the app
* BTC, LTC, DOGE wallet support
* ETH + ERC20 support coming soon

Racoin is created on a platform in the Bitcoin block chain.,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 1468k2i3gsl11...*

The things that will be common in the future, we must not leave them for the future, we must do them now.

And you who have realized that...

You are a true proprietor end investor.

&amp;#x200B;

**ABOUT**

RaCoin is the only real universal currency of Ramen that exists in the world.

Why don’t we call it RamenCoin, but Racoin?

That's because that is the name used in Japan, which is the major country of Ramen.

In Japan, the words related to the Ramen are shortened to “Ra”.

For example, if the word were RamenMania, in Japan it would be ""RaMania"".

There are several words related to Ramen as that.

&amp;#x200B;

RaCoin was designed to be used worldwide by the Society for the Dissemination of Racoin (SDR).

Initial Coins Offerrings (ICOs), or Initial Token Sales (ITSs) are mostly collective fundings that try to collect money.

Therefore, the purchased currency has neither circulation nor compatibility.

They are not designed for the actual use of the currency or the buyer’s benefit.

On the other hand, most of ICO participants think as if it was the lottery and dream to obtain tremendous profits someday.

Most are gamblers who buy with the thought of economic speculation.

For that reason, there are many ICOs that take advantage of this demand.

Therefore, it creates misunderstandings about virtual currencies or ICOs.

However, instead of being an ICO, Racoin has been designed thinking about its usefulness and its popularization due to its exchange capacity.

In addition, it can be used as a service ticket or as a tool to learn how interesting trading is.

Racoin has the potential to be famous for being the currency of the noodle culture that continues to expand worldwide.

SDR ensures that Racoin is the most realistic and the most reliable of the cryptocurrency that exist today.

It may be that Racoin is the latest token economy for you to get the chance and make your dreams come true.

&amp;#x200B;

Society for the Dissemination of Racoin（SDR）

&amp;#x200B;

**PROJECTS**

There are several types of noodles in the world.

Among all of them, like instant Ramen, Ramen is accepted by many places around the world.

The number of restaurants that offer Ramen continues to increase.

Could it be that there are still people who have never tried Ramen in the world?

We must not forget that Ramen is not a meal only supported by the minority of rich people or ramen crazies, but the common population also loves it.

Ramen is a mysterious dish that continues to evolve according to the culture or the customs of the country in which it is eaten.

Racoin will revolutionize the noodle industry and will take it to a new phase.

In addition, it will create a new world economic order, and will contribute to the vitality and dreams of the Ramen market.

It has the responsibility of promoting globalization and expanding throughout the world as a dish of current interest.

You will know the charm of Ramen when you get the Racoin.

In addition, it will evolve with you when creating a new Ramen that can only be enjoyed in your country, and it is very sure that many people will love it.

*Processing img lgy4n0t1esl11...*

&amp;#x200B;

**FEATURES**

&amp;#x200B;

**RACOIN EXCHANGE CAPACITY**

RaCoin is created on a platform in the Bitcoin block chain.

It is possible to use the well-known Bitcoin 2.0 service.

RaCoin is friendly because it can be used in the same way as Bitcoin.

It can be saved in the same wallet as Bitcoin because it has exchange capacity.

There is no need for your wallet to have torn service tickets or to be filled with service tickets from various stores.

*Processing img ariwtk2ydsl11...*

&amp;#x200B;

**RACOIN’S VALUE**

For example, a Ramen restaurant gives a RaCoin to a customer, to use it as a “Free Ramen ingredients ticket”.

The RaCoin is changed to Ramen ingredients and returns to the restaurant's wallet.

You can redistribute that RaCoin that has returned.

In this way an average price of the ingredients is created, even using the ingredient service ticket.

It may become a reality to be able to eat a Ramen dish with a RaCoin.

It can also be used for instant ramen, mail orders, donations, campaigns, events, etc. and it will indeed be a revolutionary currency.

*Processing img jrev9k0ydsl11...*

&amp;#x200B;

**MINING**

Mining can be done by restaurants that serve Ramen, noodle dishes and also by the companies that use Racoin.

For example, you can promote through social networks or in your restaurant that you have the service of a ""Large Portion of Ramen for a Racoin today"".

The customer who has Racoins goes to the restaurant and can eat a large portion of Ramen in exchange for sending the Racoin to the restaurant's wallet.

Like this example, the restaurants that use racoin, notifying their services and their events, can undermine the racoin with their ideas and send them freely.

You can sell in the market or give your customers the mined racoins.

That racoin gift will be a mine for the customer and it will be a pleasant discovery to find that restaurant.

Mining Racoins will be linked to improve the restaurant’s service and offer a service that will not get your customers bored and can get the freshness of finding new services.

The clients that expect Racoins will be happy with the variety of the restaurant’s services and will always be attentive.

*Processing img zcqoryuydsl11...*

&amp;#x200B;

**THE RACOIN STORE: ANGEL**

The risks of administration will be covered by the Racoin store, Angel.

It is possible to distribute racoins of the number of people that exceed the equilibrium point of the restaurant.

It is possible to be stable by controlling the number of customers and sales.

*Processing img vnzl2gybesl11...*

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCOVER THE MARKET’S CHARM**

Racoin will offer you something fun and it will be more rewarding to work for Ramen restaurant owners.

It is difficult to remain motivated having a heavy work of many hours, with many things to do and with so few days of rest.

Mining and trading Racoins will bring a new perspective to the life cycle that often becomes old routines.

It will prevent the decline of your mentality and performance.

It will expand your vision and values ​​as an administrator.

Discovering the market’s charm will give you something fresh and will give you vitality to your daily work.

If your potential increases, that will improve the taste of your dishes.

In addition, customers who have Racoins will be aware of the service that their restaurant offers, since it reflects the trends and changes of the market.

Also, we will present 2500 RaCoins（equivalent to 250000 yen）to the introducer of RaCoin introduced store.

Not only ramen specialty stores, but also restaurants and companies that offer noodles can introduce this coin.

P2P Exchange Bisq: “It Doesn’t Get More Decentralized Than This”," 

With a recent surge in so-called decentralized cryptocurrency [exchange](https://www.bitcoinnews.com/category/exchange) platforms, [peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange platform Bisq](https://bisq.network/) appears to be one of the very few to attempt serious decentralization.

Once the favored method of exchange, P2P volume has fallen over the years but with increasing privacy and security challenges on centralized exchanges, some like Bisq see a revival in the concept of direct exchange via P2P.

Felix Moreno is one of just a few individuals who work on the decentralized P2P exchange platform Bisq openly. Most people working on it volunteer their services anonymously and for free. Why? Because, as Moreno told Bitcoin News, it is the ”holy grail” of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

Bitcoin News caught up with Moreno to discuss the logistics of running a nearly entirely decentralized exchange, why they will have to fight tooth and nail to keep it that way, and why know-your-customer (KYC) regulations are really just a way for the government to get into your pockets.

HitBTC holding my bitcoins hostage for months! Is it just me?,"I deposited 10+ bitcoins there to trade but then found better prices on another exchange, however when I tried to withdraw it appeared they are on hold.

They requested a ton of documentation and verifications which I provided but they kept asking for stuff including stuff that have been provided already. 

It was funny that after all the documentation I provided they insisted on a gmail account, but I don't have one. Was never aware that is required.

Anyway, at this point it appears that they keep asking for stuff just to stall and I'm not sure if they have intention at all to release my bitcoins. This all has been going on for couple of months now.

What are my options to fight this at this point? For me this is almost everything I had and their actions are having real life consequences for me.

"What we're experiencing right now is not the ""crypto-bubble"" exploding, it's the ""next Bitcoin"" bubble exploding.","I think in 2017 we experienced two, highly correlated but different bubbles: the first was one more of Bitcoin's price discovery bubbles and the second was the ""next Bitcoin"" bubble where a lot of FUD and misinformation caused an important number of newbies and speculators to believe that Bitcoin was dying and that the next Bitcoin was among over one thousand of alternative coins. 

Today we have apparently reached a somewhat solid bottom in Bitcoin but we're witnessing alts free fall because the second cycle, in which speculators are realizing Bitcoin was actually never threatened as the absolute leader in the crypto space.

I wouldn't so bold to try to predict bitcoin/alts price for the near future, but I feel quite confident the decoupling will continue and we will probably see BTC market dominance over 80% in the next weeks or months, which in my opinion, is great for the future of Bitcoin and crypto in general. Remember this all started being about crypto scarcity, and the alt explosion wasn't good at all for that narrative.

My story of being the first Bitcoin purchase in a New York City retail store,"Hey guys, so I’m from a relatively small town in Mississippi, a nice little novelty in itself, but my friends and I decide one weekend to road trip up to see the City! So we (3 friends 20-22yrs of age) make it up and are exploring around when we decide to stop at a shop called “MoMatcha”. It had a real nice feel to it. Bright colors, cool art, friendly staff.(a cool gen z/millennial vibe) They sell tea and things of that sort. Well I make my way to the counter and decide to try out some CBD because I had never tried pure CBD. I get to counter to discover they don’t accept cash. I ask if they accept bitcoin by chance and the cashier’s face immediately lights up and he says they actually just recently began accepting bitcoin with me being the first one to ask. They were using a wallet on some sort of social media site called Ense. I downloaded the app, but found it wasn’t as efficient as the wallets I was used to and it was pretty unfamiliar to both parties. The owner was in shop and curious about the entire space so I explained to him that there were more efficient wallets he could use. He was very open to the entire idea of crypto and downloaded a paper wallet. We talked and they thought it was ironically cool/funny that I being from Mississippi was their bitcoin pioneer. I told them we were laying foundations for the future and more would come one day. It was overall a great experience. The CBD product/shop vibe was very pleasant and I’d recommend the store to any and all in the New York area!

ICO Investments,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zp2ab38pwul11.jpg

To most people, an ICO is when investors are offered some units of cryptocurrency in exchange for cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. ICOs have been used to fund start-ups if there is a demand for the cryptocurrency. Normally, investors spend digital tokens on the platform or sell them later, on crypto exchanges at a different price.

&amp;#x200B;

As a rule, at the initial stage, all ISO projects are actively searching for investments. And it's tiresome. Surfing the Internet from morning to night in search of your angels is not the best idea for a young project.

21 million bitcoin question,"This issue has always bothered me about bitcoin.  The supposed 21 million cap in bitcoins is simply a number in a computer program.   The cap can be changed simply by changing the 21 to a 22. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time the bitcoin code is changed, such as with the lightning network, they are showing how the 21 million cap can be changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

If enough people want the 21 to be 22, it will become 22.  This is just like the debt ceiling in congress.  They keep setting a ceiling and then keep raising it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only way to truly have  cap is if there were a physical limit.  Since crypto is a computer program it is physically impossible to have any cap or limit.  ",1536793093,12/09/2018 22:58:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fcn16/21_million_bitcoin_question/,1

Look at what the Intercontinental Exchange has built!! 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180803005236/en/Intercontinental-Exchange-Announces-Bakkt-Global-Platform-Ecosystem

http://fortune.com/longform/nyse-owner-bitcoin-exchange-startup/

This is where they are going to put everyones 401k's and Pensions. The Gov't wont be able to contribute to the funds any more. But by placing them in a Digitally Scarce asset, they will become more and more valuable over time as people all over the world buy Bitcoin and other digital assets.  

From 2009 to Today, we are considered the early adopters. in the next year, all of Wall Street and risk taking Businesses will flood the market and raise the price to new highs that will blow everyones minds. 

To secure their wealth and increase their own holdings, they will start dumping everyone's 401k's and Pensions into Bitcoin and Litecoin and many others. Doing this increases their holdings value, and if early adopters cash out, they are taking money from the 401k's who came in late. But at this point, there will be no point to cash out into dollars as you should be able to buy anything in Bitcoin by this point in 2020/2021.  And since this money is meant for Retirement, they are instant hodlers. When Bitcoin is this high in Value, even if the market drops by a few dozen billion it will be a drop in the trillions being stored on the blockchain. 

https://news.bitcoin.com/nyse-owner-bitcoin-should-be-in-retirement-funds-credit-cards-retail-stores/

The Gov't will tell you, If you want to help your grandma's retirement Fund(and your own), go Buy some Bitcoin with your paycheck. Doing so will make her Bitcoin more valuable. And Suddenly, 100% of America has a Good god damn reason to buy some Crypto Currency. And the Rest of the world will see it as a global reserve currency backed by trillions of dollars in American Pensions and 401k's.  

I think Trump will Nationalize the Federal Reserve and appoint people to Control the Money Suppy, And if the Central Bankers don't like this and try to hyper inflate the dollar by sending them all home to roost, then those dollars will be redirected into cryptos, further increasing the value of Everyone's pensions and 401ks and all of Wall Street who had bought in and especially all of us Early Adopters.

I really think this is the way the world is going to turn. We will be saved from doom. The only other options is to not bail out the banks and watch the world economies and wealth vanish into thin air and there will be Millions upon Millions, probably Billions of deaths.

     Esta plataforma que tiene poco tiempo en funcionamiento tiene la particularidad de ser igual a Steemit pero mejorado, esto no significa que Steemit pasara al olvido, al contrario considero que irán a la par, porque muchos de los que estamos aquí podremos tener un nuevo espacio para reinventarnos.

&amp;#x200B;

   Algunas de las mejoras que considero muy útil es que aun no recibiendo votos o comentarios puedes ver cuantos usuarios vieron el post, esto nos da una idea del alcance que tiene.

     Otras de las ventajas que tendrá WEKU es que podrás realizar audio y vídeo para los post sin necesidad de una aplicación o plataforma externa. Esto no está nada mal, entiendo que para muchos de los que estamos en Steemit es un dolor de cabeza, sin embargo, no quiere decir que sea algo malo para Steemit debido a que las plataformas de vídeos como lo son Dtube y Dlive tienen vida propia basada en la red de Steemit.

     La otra modalidad de WEKU es que para abrir un post no sales del blog para entrar al artículo, este se despliega sobre el mismo blog y la presentación es más amena.

Chaos and rationality about blockchain tourism,"The huge volume of the tourism market occupies a significant weight in today's society. According to statistics, in 2017, the contribution of tourism nationwide was about 980 million US dollars, accounting for almost 10% of global GDP, and created about 9.1% of employment opportunities around the world. Therefore, after the outbreak of the blockchain, the tourism industry was predicted to be the next industry to be subverted, and the blockchain tourism platform such as LEOOY was born in the current situation.

In 2017, China's per capita travels reached 3.7 times, and the number of outbound tourists ranked first in the world. The comprehensive contribution rate of tourism in national economy and social employment exceeded 10%, and the status of strategic pillar industry became more prominent. With the continuous development of technological innovation, the online travel platform has been constantly changing and innovating. The tourism industry has undergone rapid changes in recent years. From offline to online, the tourism industry has always been inclusive, reciprocal, convenient and fast. But it is also because of the strong monopoly of some OTA giants, the price is high, the inventory is opaque, and the bundle is sold, which has a great adverse impact on the tourism industry.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/37fcfety9zl11.jpg

First of all, due to the information asymmetry in the tourism industry and the reason of the middlemen, there is often a huge price difference. Many transactions in the tourism industry have multiple links or multiple middlemen. The opaque price and the small “cost of link” are factors that reduce the passenger experience. However, if the traditional OTA is effectively combined with the blockchain technology, its decentralization and trustworthiness will provide a lot of benefits in reducing transaction links and reducing the division of middlemen. It will also eliminate the emergence of such phenomena as “oversold” and enhance the travel experience of passengers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cbz8siuiazl11.png

Secondly, the traceability and irreparable modification of blockchain technology can also help the retention and verification of passengers' identity information. Take Le Guu, as long as you have the LEOOY Pass, you don't need to repeat the authentication. The repetitive authentication time required for ticket pre-order, reservation, and authentication will be greatly reduced. At the same time, it is also the only way to establish a ""trust ecology.""

In addition, in the Internet era, all kinds of false information and false comments have brought a lot of deceptiveness to travelers' choice of travel tools and residential hotels. When the information of various service providers in the itinerary is on the chain and the comments are on the chain, it can be done: every consumer is a supervisor, everyone can check, all kinds of real comments are clearly understood, and false information or bills can be Trace back to the source and retain evidence to seek justice for merchants and travelers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/w2bh2fu5azl11.png

However, at present, the blockchain + tourism is still in the stage of continuous integration and progress, and there are still many problems that cannot be completely solved at this stage, such as hard conditions such as policy supervision. However, for the future prospects of blockchain tourism, many Internet giants still believe that the arrival of blockchain technology will bring disruptive changes to the tourism industry and always maintain a positive attitude. The blockchain tourism platform such as LEOOY is also constantly changing and improving its technology. I believe that in time, the blockchain tourism era that truly belongs to consumers is coming soon.",1536832611,13/09/2018 09:56:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fgnn9/chaos_and_rationality_about_blockchain_tourism/,1

Britain's longest running Soap features storyline about Cryptocurrency,"[https://bitcoinist.com/cryptocurrency-coronation-street/](https://bitcoinist.com/cryptocurrency-coronation-street/)

Coronation Street is [**the worlds longest running TV soap opera**](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-running-tv-soap-opera), with a regular audience of around 8 million. In the programme, Ryan Connor, a semi-regular character since 2006, has gambled away the money he earned DJing in Ibiza. He then remembers investing 50 quid (£50) in WhipCoin several years ago. A quick internet search and he realizes that his investment is now worth £250 million.

If only he could remember his password!

Just my thoughts on this sub.,"I've been in crypto a while now, and held Bitcoin through that entire time. I used to love seeing all the memes , important info , and other posts in this subreddit. 

Lately the only thing I seem to be seeing are a bunch of angry people bashing on other crypto's for really no reason. Shitcoin this, shitcoin that, everything's a shitcoin If it's not bitcoin.

The real fact is that if your looking on paper, there are far better choices for an online digital currency over bitcoin. There's cheaper, faster, and more secure coins out there. The only reason Bitcoin will stay where it is for the foreseeable future is that it was the first coin in this market, and has been here the longest. 

People were buying and selling Bitcoin way before any other alts, there's more dead addresses then most alts have active addresses. Almost 1/3 of bitcoins available coins aren't even active, meaning roughly 1/3 of bitcoins market cap is in lost coins right now. Kinda scary.

Anyways I'm just gonna end it here and watch the downvotes and crying kids deal with this. But for any mods reading this, know that if this my opionin on this sub's post direction, then I am not the only one. For anyone looking to get into Bitcoin, if they were to come.to this sub they would probably laugh at the majority of posts and comments in this section. It's really quite pitiful, and it's really the moderators jobs to deal with this kind of stuff.",1536836431,13/09/2018 11:00:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fgzxv/just_my_thoughts_on_this_sub/,1

Bitcoin price has a four year algorithm that corresponds with the halvening.,"Unless Bitcoin's price algorithm breaks trend, we won't see another huge wave until after the halvening. Looking at the price data in two year increments suggests Bitcoin simmers for 2 year intervals showing signs of the next big move and then erupts right around the Halvening. Here are for Bitcoin price charts, starting with the first half of the first halvening. 7/10 - 9/12  [https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2010-07-16zeg2012-09-14ztgSza1gSMAzm1g100za2gSMAzm2g200zv](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2010-07-16zeg2012-09-14ztgSza1gSMAzm1g100za2gSMAzm2g200zv). showing the price is simmering, it really hasn't made it's first huge move.

Next take a look at the second half of the first halvening (11/28/12). [https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2012-07-16zeg2014-09-14ztgSza1gSMAzm1g100za2gSMAzm2g200zv](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2012-07-16zeg2014-09-14ztgSza1gSMAzm1g100za2gSMAzm2g200zv). The price erupts sometime around the first halvening.

&amp;#x200B;

Next take a look at the first half of the second halvening 07/14 - 9/16, again the price simmers not really showing it's next move completely. [https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2014-07-16zeg2016-09-14ztgSza1gSMAzm1g100za2gSMAzm2g200zv](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2014-07-16zeg2016-09-14ztgSza1gSMAzm1g100za2gSMAzm2g200zv).

Finally the last half of the second halvening 07/16 - 09/18, the price erupts for the second time sometime just after the second halvening ( July 9, 2016 ) .

John McAfee might be right,"Although not completely decentralized, Bitcoin can already provide mico-payments to 100 companies for all 7.6 billion people on this planet IF the bitcoin price increases significantly.

**I know** a lot of assumptions will be made but they are reasonable assumptions just to get the idea.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's assume that to be able to make micro-payments to Youtube, 1 million people pay (on average) $10 via their bank account or in cash to 1 lightning node owner/company. This way (on average) people would put a negligible amount of money at risk. With a bitcoin price of the order of $10k, that lightning node owner/company would need a:

    $10 x 1,000,000 / $10,000 = 1,000 btc channel

To serve 7,600 million people, we would need 7,600 such lightning nodes. Thus, in total, we would need

    7.6 million btc in all channels

which is far too much unless the bitcoin price increases a lot.

Let's also assume these nodes update their channels with Youtube every week, so Youtube can cash out or something. That would be one on-chain closing transaction and one on-chain opening transaction. So

    7,600 x 52 x 2 = 790,400 Tx/year/company

Now let's assume these nodes are not only connected to Youtube but to 100 companies. This would mean:

    790,400 x 100 = 79,040,000 Tx/year

These transactions are about 250 bytes each and assuming 2MB blocks, Bitcoin can do:

    2,000,000 / 250 x 6 x 24 x 365 = 420,480,000 Tx/year

So we would need:

    79,040,000 / 420,480,000 = 19%

of all on-chain Bitcoin transactions to serve the whole world with micro-transactions.",1536841150,13/09/2018 12:19:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fhh9u/john_mcafee_might_be_right/,1

Configuring bitcoin full node for faster RPC calls,"I have been working with a bitcoin full node and attempting to parse the blockchain data, whilst storing it in an external database. 

The script I am using iterates through each block using getblock\[hash;2\] which populates multiiple tables. However in order to get the current blocks input values we have to perform an expensive getRawTransaction each previous txid.

We have singled this out as the bottleneck in the code for most time taken, rendering the script very slow. We have also tried using RPC batching but this also takes considerable amount of time, potentially more with a memory overhead.

My question is around configuration of the daemon, is there a best configuration to improve RPC call speed? i.e. using rpcthread/queue, increasing dbcache etc.

New CRYPTOCURRENCY? Initiative Q,"There's a new cryptocurrency in town (well, the world), Initiative Q. I've just signed up and got some free coins, which is pretty cool. Anyone else already a member? Opinions?

It's in it's early days so for a limited introduction period coins are being offered free (!) to those who register early. This can only be done via an invite link from existing members, see below.

INITIATIVE Q invitation link: [https://initiativeq.com/invite/BMPmeFa8m](https://initiativeq.com/invite/BMPmeFa8m)

There are no hidden catches and no strings attached as far as I can see. I just signed up and got free credits. Invite more people and you'll receive even more free coins.

I guess it's similar to how Bitcoin started? A small initiative with no value to begin with which only few (very lucky ones) took seriously. Well, those who bought Bitcoins early are now rich! Initiative Q seems to be doing exactly the same - only you don't even need to pay in order to get coins - they're now given totally free..

Is it possible Initiative Q coins will never gain value? Yes. However the same could've been said for Bitcoin in it's early days. Is it possible Initiative Q will become the next big cryptocurrency and by gaining credit now you'll get real money later? Absolutely. So I'm thinking now is the time to get onboard, right?

I don't work for Initiative Q, I've simply signed up in the same way and am now inviting others to join in.

It seems legit, if anyone has experience or any opinions please post (again, I'm not part of the Initiative Q team, but can do my best to answer). Otherwise, if you wanna join you can use the link below to sign up, no need to reply to this post. I'll be notified when you do and approve your invitation right away.

Here's hoping this will be the next big thing! :)

Cheers.

Want to work with Blockchain..,"Hey there,
Cryptoverse, nerds and crypto enthuaists.
I consider myself  a nerd, crypto ethuaist and a enterpreneur or atleast want to build up to it.
I am not a IT guy, so the coding is all alien technology for me. But, I am so excited about the cryptoverse and what it would be in 10 years from now. I can already see so many use cases that are being utilized in the real world. I want to work wit this community and help build this future, that we have all been visioning for years now.
I do not know where to start though, Have been looking for some acctedited courses with no luck.
I am willing to go to school and get my certificate or degree if thats what it takes for me to get my hands wet on this field.
Can anyone give me any advice or suggestion on how i should get started?

Quantum immunity and bitcoin - revived discussion and questions,"Here is the underlying question (#1):
1) What protocols, such as New Hope, or approaches, such as usage of Lamport or Sphincs -  to achieve stateless many-time signatures - are likeliest to find their way into general bitcoin development processes?

Followup inquiries:
2) What sort of problems are encountered potentially in systems that have implemented (or rely upon systems that have implemented) a Lamport signature scheme, where the usage is optional?

3) Multisignature and lightning developments. How are these affected post QC and/or what preparations need to be made?

4) Privacy oriented wallets, such as Samourai, Wasabi, etc., secure/cold wallet tech such as Trezor, and repositories where strong privacy is developed. As these will become more targeted post QC, what are the best approaches for defense?

5) ""How long until?"" That is, how long until QC is not merely viable in Google's lab, or in an NSA office or China, but how long until it can be readily produced for most larger corporate interests?",1536856444,13/09/2018 16:34:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fjj4e/quantum_immunity_and_bitcoin_revived_discussion/,1

Question about LN routing,"When setting up payment channels on a LN node, my strategy was to create channels with a handful of the largest nodes. Then after playing around on LN visualizers, I realized all these large nodes I'm connecting to are already connected to each other directly, with very well funded channels orders of magnitude larger than mine. I suppose that should have been no surprise.

So is this a bad strategy if my end goal is to get many people incentivised to connect with me and open more channels? There is no reason for one of those large nodes to use me if they are already directly connected to all the other large nodes that I am connected to. Certainly none of them had opened a return channel to me.",1536857983,13/09/2018 16:59:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fjr0d/question_about_ln_routing/,1

I used the price difference between the exchanges for making some profit:

\- Rate at [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com/): $6500

\- Rate at [BTC-A-Trade](https://btcatrade.com/): $7215








Steps:


1. I've sold  [13.41644771 bitcoins](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1NeaaxtvLQ7vMF9e9Ri5h7LDYDcgLDmpUL) at BTC-A-Trade and I got [$96K payout](https://pasteboard.co/HCSmcif.png)
2. 10 minutes later I bought the same amount of bitcoins for $87K at Coinbase, 
3. = which leaves me with $9000 profit.

How about adjusting nonce length to force distribute hashing power?,"As far as I know extra nonce has been introduced because some powerful rigs were running empty after consuming all the original 32bit nonce's variability within less than a timestamp-second. So what if nonce length would be automatically adjusted according to the number of mining accounts, so that each account had a certain equal limit of the chance to succeed in a given block's mining? Which would then:

* make piling up mining power economically pointless above a certain limit and thus mining would be more distributed
* need a limitation on the number of mining accounts, otherwise people would just pile up accounts with rigs simultaneously
   * this may be done by some central authority
   * this authority could maybe only limit people entering the mining competition, couldn't expel anybody
   * this authority would have nothing to do with non-mining user accounts which would be there arbitrarily many

"3rd layer for ease of use end users, on top of Lightning?","Hi all!

In these pretty exciting bear markety times (and I genuinely mean that), it is amazing to see so many awesome developments. And while I am still learning on a daily basis about the fundamentals of crypto, it has caught me and is not letting go.

This morning I woke up after a frantic Bitcoin dream, in which I feverishly tried to explain Bitcoin and the Lightning network to my girlfriend. Alas, I was unsuccesful due to the usual dream crap, preventing you from completing your task, but it did wake me up thinking about some stuff in regards to usability for the end users.

I know there have been maaaaaaaany discussions and of course, developments to make Bitcoin (and crypto in general) easier and faster to use, but there is still so much that people need to take into consideration that there is a learning curve.

A few days ago, I read up again on an article about the lightning network, after seeing some cool updates here, and even though it is definitely ""understandable"" and with recent app developments much easier in use, there are still so many things that kind of made it ""not so easy"".

So, after a long winded post, I guess my question is, is it possible that both ""doing crypto"" on chain or on the lightning network, will always be too difficult to Joe Shmoe, and could we ever move to a situation that there will be some sort of ""3rd"" layer on top of what we have now, where we as the ""crypto people"" sustain and update the network for the ""end users"" above it?

For example, things like updating wallets, making sure you're on the right chain, terms like payment channels and whatnot, could it be ever possible that those things are done ""behind the scenes"" for the regular people using it?

To the point that they don't have to worry about anything in regards to the tech behind the currency? No updating anything, no selecting any channels, simply being able to pay the person they want, with zero complications. 

I guess it would probably mean that the ""3rd"" layer would have to be some sort of centralized managed UI, which of course negates the whole idea of decentralization, in a way, but at the same time, it would provide the ease of use that honestly at this point is lacking.
And I mean ease of use for people who have no interest in cryptocurrencies other than means of paying someone quickly.

So, bottom line, summed up, could Bitcoin develop into a system where ""we"" are the hamsters in the wheel, decentralizing, lightning networking, updating etc etc etc, behind the scenes, so mom and pop can just ""click and pay""?",1536907527,14/09/2018 06:45:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fpryd/3rd_layer_for_ease_of_use_end_users_on_top_of/,1
"Bitcoin is like the rotation of the earth, sun, moon or stars","I'm reading The Bitcoin Standard and found this really insightful quote:

“Bitcoin is to be taken as it is, accepted on its own terms and used for what it offers. For all practical intents and purposes, Bitcoin is sovereign: it runs by its own rules, and there are no outsiders who can alter these rules. It might even be helpful to think of the parameters of Bitcoin as being similar to the rotation of the earth, sun, moon, or stars, forces outside of our control which are to be lived, not altered.”",1536908663,14/09/2018 07:04:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fpvfz/bitcoin_is_like_the_rotation_of_the_earth_sun/,1

How could a 100 j/TH miner compete with 65 j/TH miner?,"Simple. 100 j/TH miner should be sold cheaper, than 65 j/TH, but how much cheaper?

33 TH, 65 j/TH miner is being sold at $1569. That's $47.54 per TH.

I've calculated 100 j/TH miner sales price, keeping miner + 1 or 2 year electricity cost same as 65 j/TH miner..

When you buy a new phone or laptop and suddenly it comes pre-installed with a bitcoin wallet. That is when it will be considered weird to not be using bitcoin.,"Your web browser is your portal into the world of the internet. Your wallet is your portal into the world of bitcoin and crypto.

Just as the tech giants of today compete for web browser market share, so too will the tech giants of the future compete for bitcoin wallet market share.

When you buy a new laptop there will be a microsoft wallet installed by default, when you buy a new smart phone there will be a samsung wallet or apple wallet installed by default. Of course people will avoid the default wallets just like they avoid microsoft explorer today, and download what popular consensus deems the best wallet.

Within the next 3 to 5 years every new laptop and smart phone will come standard with a pre-installed bitcoin wallet. 

At that point NOT using bitcoin to store value or shop online will be considered only for people over the age of 50 or 60 who cant handle change and grasp desperately onto their credit cards, like their parents before them who grasped desperately onto their cheque books.

Que tal amigos, hoy les quiero hablar de una plataforma llamada WEKU, está en su etapa de actualización aunque ya tienen tiempo desarrollando el proyecto.

¿Quién quiere decir que esto es igual a Steemit? Pues de cierto modo, pero las ventajas que ofrecen WEKU son muy variadas, con esto no quiero decir que Steemit este mal, pero WEKU llega con buenos agregados que nos ayudan mucho.

Tendremos la posibilidad de montar en nuestro correo y el video de manera directa, el chat interno, la interfaz al montar el post me parece genial el toque de elegancia y se hace más ameno el trabajo.   
En este momento, están en proceso de lanzamiento de aire, el cual tiene todas las características que nos permiten ganar dinero con nosotros. WEKU, solo debes dar un pequeño recorrido y me entiendeás.

Por el momento esta plataforma está trabajando de manera fluida, se siente bastante rápido a pesar de que toda la comunidad, que solo me da un significado que se puede pensar bien y no quiere repetir errores de otras plataformas.

Proyectos como este se agradecen, en este mundo siempre tenemos una nueva oportunidad para seguir adelante, para eso llega WEKU, ojalá en el futuro sigan saliendo proyectos como este.

How do we think about market cap,"I have been wondering about the meaning of the marketcap for crypto recently.

My aim is to understand what's the meaning of marketcap and how it is compared to other assets.

The general formula for stocks (used also in CMC) is: Total Market Cap = N.of Pieces * Unit Price

For Bitcoin or other cryptos we can easily check CMC.

I did the same for gold in order to understand. I ckecked the data first and found that the total marketcap of gold is 7.8Trillions.

Now for the quantity of gold.

In the world are mined up to now a total of 131.700 Tonnes of Gold. This equals to 171.300.000.000 Grams of Gold.

So if there is a variation of 1USD for a gram of gold, this means there is a variation of 171.300.000.000USD in Market Cap.

Is this correct? Those numbers doesen't really make sense in my mind. Or am I correct and my logic does not have flows?",1536945799,14/09/2018 17:23:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ftxrv/how_do_we_think_about_market_cap/,1

Alternative approach to Bitcoin difficulty,"The current difficulty is adjusted automatically with the intent of ensuring that a new block is mined roughly every 10 minutes irrespective of the network hash rate.  This is necessary to ensure transactions are always processed at a predictable rate, however I see no reason why the amount of newly minted bitcoin needs to be predictable.

What if the difficulty also adjusted the payout from mining a block, such that the higher the difficulty, the less BTC the miner would mint for themselves.  This would have a downwards pressure on the network hash rate, and make it unprofitable for too many miners to participate (and therefore waste too much global energy).

I appreciate that the higher the hash rate the higher the security of the network (in theory), however given the apparent concentration of mining into a few key players, and the exorbitant energy usage of PoW, it seems a downwards pressure on the hash rate may be beneficial - at the moment it seems like an infinite arms-race, with the big weakness that there is a feed-forward cycle in that the most successful miner will earn the most and be able to reinvest that into more hardware making them more money, to reinvest into more hardware etc etc.  A downwards pressure would at least slow down this cycle.

Can anyone think of anything terrible with this idea?",1536953556,14/09/2018 19:32:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fv1y5/alternative_approach_to_bitcoin_difficulty/,1

Bitcoin's uncanny similarities with Gold,"## Bitcoin – Striking Similarities to Gold

Bitcoin is commonly viewed as a form of digital gold and both gold and Bitcoin do share a lot of similar properties. This means that interesting insights into Bitcoin can be gained by looking at the impact that the introduction of a gold ETF had on the gold price.

**Need to be convinced that gold is indeed similar to Bitcoin?**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 441of4uu1am11...*

**So, what happened when the gold ETF was finally launched?** 

Well, it kick-started the biggest bull run in gold’s history. Prices rose from just $331.60 per ounce to a high of $1,917.90. That’s an incredible **478% increase in price after the gold ETF was launched.**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img xv24jye42am11...*

The interesting thing about the history of gold and Bitcoin is that both got futures contracts before an ETF was launched. In both cases, there was a big increase in price before the futures markets opened and there was a significant fall in the price of both assets when futures trading actually began.

LN : Bitcoin :: Pre-1970 USD : Gold,"If you don't understand the title, it reads,

""The lightning network is to bitcoin, as USD (pre 1970) was to gold.

Basically the point of the gold standard was to keep the stability/predictability benefits of gold, while being more divisible, scaleable, and easier to transact with.  The USA originally used gold and silver coins as money.  When they introduced paper bills, they actually represented gold:

""Therefore, in the Coinage Act of 1834, the 15:1 ratio of silver to gold was changed to a 16:1 ratio by reducing the weight of the nation's gold coinage. This created a new U.S. dollar that was backed by 1.50 g (23.22 grains) of gold.""

You can see that a US dollar was just a placeholder for actual gold.  You can also see that ratio was not necessarily guaranteed in this case, as the conversion from USD -&gt; gold was a centralized process.

This is essentially what the Lightning Network is.  You can trade actual BTC for LN-tokens.  You can then transact in LN-tokens quickly and easily.  There is no real need to convert LN-tokens back into BTC in many cases, as everyone understand they are essentially the same thing as actual BTC.  Much like people transacted in USD knowing it was convertible to gold, people will presumably transact in LN-tokens.

So LN is, in a way, bitcoin's more transparent take on the USD gold standard.

(Just to be clear, this has nothing to do with the fiat USD of today, which many people here strongly oppose).",1536967567,14/09/2018 23:26:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9fwvgj/ln_bitcoin_pre1970_usd_gold/,1

A few concerns with the security of using a Ledger hardware wallet...Requires too much trust in third parties.,"I have a few concerns about the Ledger hardware wallets and am hoping to generate some discussion about these, being that a huge percentage of the Bitcoin community relies on these devices to store their coins. I think this is extremely important and should be addressed and fleshed out thoroughly, once and for all.

1) The Ledger company admits that part of their device is not open source and that the code of the closed-sourced tech cannot be published due to non-disclosure agreements with the manufacturing company protecting the proprietary and secret technology.   Huge security flaw. Seems like they could publish the code if they wanted and simply scramble the proprietary info. But even if they did, the hardware itself would need to be audited.

2) To my knowledge, there has never been an independent audit performed on the Ledger's code or hardware by a third party. Is anyone aware of such an audit?

3) The Ledger CTO has said that using their device inherently requires the user to place some degree of trust in the Ledger team. So, not only does a user need to trust the Ledger team, but a user must trust the unnamed manufacturer of Ledger's closed-sourced chip, and trust that it is not compromised during the manufacturing stage, via a backdoor or covert transmitting mechanism, etc.

4) It is impossible to be sure that the private keys and seed words generated by the Ledger are actually 100% randomized. Meaning, the Ledger team could have a database of pre-generated keys and seeds that the wallet pulls from. Ledger does allow you to generate your own seeds or important your own, which is great, but it's impossible to verify that your seeds or private keys are not being transmitted to a third party via the proprietary hardware.

As I said, being that so many people use Ledger's products, I think this is an extremely important issue that should be discussed thoroughly, from a technical aspect. 

Should we really be placing trust in Ledger and its unnamed manufacturer (which is likely a Chinese company), being that they are using propriety closed-soured hardware and code to allegedly protect our coins? If so, why? Explain the pros/cons of trusting the Ledger team and another anonymous company.

To me, it seems that using a completely open-sourced wallet such as Electrum or Mycelium, which have been thoroughly vetted and independently tested and are completely trustless (aside from trusting the general consensus of the community that has vetted the code), would be more secure than using a Ledger. 

What are your thoughts?

Best cryptocurrencies of all times | Bitcoin tops the list,"**Bitcoin (BTC) :**

**Bitcoin** is a [cryptocurrency](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cryptocurrency), a form of electronic cash. It is a decentralized [digital currency](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Digital_currency) without a [central bank](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Central_bank) or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the [peer-to-peer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Peer-to-peer) bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

Bitcoin was first introduced as an open-source software by an anonymous programmer, or a group of programmers, under the alias [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) in 2009. There has been a lot of rumours about the real identity of BTC’s creator, however all of the people mentioned in those rumours have publicly denied being Nakamoto.

**Ether** is a [cryptocurrency](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cryptocurrency) whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. *Ether* can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed. Ethereum provides a decentralized [Turing-complete](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing_completeness) [virtual machine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Virtual_machine), the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. ""Gas"", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate [spam](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spamming) and allocate resources on the network.

Awesome platform for Music Lovers and Crypto Nerds,"I just saw this after[Street Cleaner posted his fund-raiser to help woman that are victims of Domestic Violence](https://groupees.com/streetcleaner) and got a massive sense of elation from what this platform could do:

[https://groupees.com/](https://groupees.com/)

Essentially, artists put their music on their in bundles for a set price and can offer to make XX% of funds available to charity of their choice, if the donaor chooses to. 

On top of that they have grouped rewards if they achieve a set milestone/benchmark price. Its so simple but equally brilliant.

I kind of envisioned something like this would occur when Soundcloud started accepting BTC, and kind of lost hope as no one bothered to use it let alone participated in it.

Music is basically a non-profit based endeavor for 99% of artists, its pretty much PR/marketing that will likely not be bought, but  since most artists prefer to be heard than paid these days monetization avenues need to be creative; luckily this is the ideal middle ground for those than want to support the artists, but also try to help out others in need with as little fees as possible. Its super reasonable.

I really do hope this takes off, this could be THE new way music spreads with BTC finally playing a vital role in making sure all involved win and middlemen/studios can fuck off.",1537011086,15/09/2018 11:31:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9g0skc/awesome_platform_for_music_lovers_and_crypto_nerds/,1

Unintentional HODL'ing insight by John C. Dvorak,"Check out this interview between John C. Dvorak and Scott Adams.

In the beginning, they're talking about the emergence of the world wide web and how they missed the opportunity of a lifetime by not buying Cisco and then later Apple stock.

Dvorak then says something to the extend of ""imagine you bought Apple right when Steve Jobs came back, for like $10'000. You'd be loaded. But the reality is, you can't hold the stock that long. Unless you put it in a trust and forgot you even got it.""

It starts about min 2:45: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkN54YfbrIU

Now Bitcoin is of course not a company or a stock in a company, but the insights are, I think, valuable. The insight being

A) hodling is what makes you rich (assuming you didn't buy bags) and

B) it's so difficult after a certain point of price increase, because the temptation to cash out is so high, that a guy who's been involved in tech-companies since the beginning of the Internet says *it's impossible*.

Lets prove him wrong. ",1537015988,15/09/2018 12:53:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9g18fi/unintentional_hodling_insight_by_john_c_dvorak/,1

Help me get my wallet back,"Ok story is,

I purchased a new iMac. Created a new wallet because phone was about to break on blockchain.com, used auto generate password. Don't ask why long story short the IMAC was returned to apple without realising the auto generate password was on it. I obtained the same IMAC its 100% reset ready to send back to apple.

There was no iCloud on the computer to restore passwords.

I know new Macs use the auto generate 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 so for example it generates a password such as this 349-gt2-69z-qQL. The website is blockchain.com, I have my identifier and access to my email what can I do?

if anybody can help me I can give you $1000

Even if illegal methods I can 100% prove I own the wallet before requesting such action. thanks.

"AA points out: 'wallet' was a poor choice of word, 'keychain' would be better.","Andreas Antonopoulos points out how, in the early days, certain terms like ""coin"" and ""wallet"" were selected in an apparent attempt to make it easier for people to understand, but some of these terms have ended up causing a lot of confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, our ""coins"" are not stored in our ""wallets"".  lol  You can't just copy your physical wallet (the one in your pocket or handbag).  You **can** go to a hardware store and copy a **key** (or ring full of keys), and both keys will open the same locks.  It's important to protect our keys, and to have an emergency back up copy stored in a secure, but separate location.

Safest / Least Trusted Way To HODL Bitcoin,"Hello everyone, I'd like to try to get the topic of the absolute safest way to store your Bitcoin long-term started here. A lot of times you'll hear different experts claiming that the best trade-off between complication and security for the average person would be to simply buy a hardware wallet. To me although this may be satisfactory to most, I have issue trusting hardware wallet producers 100%. Especially the ones that do not have completely open source software for public vetting and that use have chip producers that have most likely worked with government agencies in the past (possible back doors) . So, with all that said, please chime in and let us know what you believe to be to the most secure way to store Bitcoin long-term is.  We have a lot of very intelligent and altruistic people here that have not only a vested interest in Humanities Evolution, but also an evolution in terms of their own Financial betterment. That being said even if the method that you mention seems overly complicated for the average user, I'm sure that if enough people agree with you that there would be more than one willing participant to take on a step-by-step guide at the community could vet. 

Here are a few things that enter my mind when considering how to store BTC:

- where am I putting my trust in both the hardware and software that I'm using? 
- what is the best way I can I test my solution?
- what are the attack vectors for my chosen storage options (physical and digital) 

Personally I've found that the best way to generate your own Bitcoin addresses is rolling dice. Once you've rolled the dice enough times to generate enough addresses, simply downloading bitaddress.org and printing in an offline printer paper wallets and laminating them. Ideally you will also encrypt them with a password or passphrase that you will remember as this will minimize the likeliness of any theft.

Thank you in advance for your feedback!",1537031567,15/09/2018 17:12:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9g35gs/safest_least_trusted_way_to_hodl_bitcoin/,1

Worst case scenario for Bitcoin.,"Ok, blockchain tech is one of the most promising, revolutionary and important tech of our time, and it's not going anywhere, no doubt about that. We all (we includes me) also strongly believe in bitcoin that one day it'll be the world currency. But it is always wise to know what is the woese that can happen. So here is the worst case scenario, in my opinion, for btc. 

All the techniques fail to make btc more scalable, faster and transactions feeless. In this form, this can't be the world currency so it fails to be the world currency.

Now, with all the huge money in bitcoin, along with the transparent blockchain tech, very limited supply, and the security, it will always be the 'digital gold', the preferred store of value, which can be transferred with ease across the borders and more secure. (unlike gold and silver).

So in my worst case scenario, I see bitcoin not only survive, but thrive. I'd love to know what you think of this and what is your worst case scenario.",1537032539,15/09/2018 17:28:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9g39yw/worst_case_scenario_for_bitcoin/,1

"Sister found her seed phrase, doesn't know which wallet she used","I've been trying to help her access her wallet she obtained YEARS ago when she was gifted bitcoin on the internet. This was longg ago and about a year ago she told me she had bitcoin but didn't know any of her info. Fast forward to this year, she moved and found the paper with her ""password"" but didn't know which email she used, as she's used a ton of aliases. 

  
I checked out the paper and behold.. seed phrase to a wallet! I personally use coinbase, but coinbase doesn't use seed phrases for their wallets. S o o ... I'm now trying to figured out how to go about testing this phrase? I don't want to plug it into a bunch of random apps for security purposed. I don't know what wallets are trustable or how I should best proceed with this.

BTC addresses for BAKKT?,"Just curious if any redditor investigators have been able to deduce the BAKKT warehouse btc addresses?   

Remember, all transactions for BAKKT will occur on an off chain BAKKT ledger, not the btc blockchain.  This was explained  in the original [Fortune](http://fortune.com/longform/nyse-owner-bitcoin-exchange-startup/) article:

&gt;Bakkt, however, would transform Bitcoin’s architecture to run at high speed. Imagine that dozens of mutual funds, pension funds, and endowments hold Bitcoin in the Bakkt warehouse. If Asset Manager A buys $200 million in Bitcoin from Asset Manager B, the Bitcoin tokens simply move from B’s account at Bakkt to A’s account at Bakkt, via a trade on the ICE exchange. The total number of Bitcoins held at Bakkt doesn’t change. Let’s assume that millions of those transactions happen every day, all inside the Bakkt ecosystem. Bakkt simply keeps a ledger of those offsetting Bitcoin debit and credits. The individual purchases and sales don’t need to be broadcast to the blockchain. What does need to be broadcast are any payments coming into or exiting Bakkt’s warehouse.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Hence, so long as Bakkt controls a big share of the market, it would need to report only a tiny sliver of transactions to the blockchain, enabling its system to operate at warp speed.

"Questions about the Pareto principle, hardness of money and Bitcoin.","I've read a lot from maximalists who think Bitcoin will, over time, consume value from other currencies over time due to [Network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect), [hardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency), etc.

While these views all make sense to me and I do agree with them I have a couple questions.

First, if hardness is such an important factor in the value of a money why aren't we using Gold as our money now? (Is the answer that there are other limiting factors, for example gold isn't sufficiently divisible, transportable, etc?)

Second, how do we know how much value Bitcoin will consume over time from existing currencies, will it be 99% of the value, 80% such as with a [Pareto distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution) or less, such as with the current value of the US dollar?

What both of these questions are trying to get at is there seems to be many factors which influence the long term value of Bitcoin but how do we know which are the most dominant over time?

Block Satoshi funds to prevent Future Attacks,"THEORY:

An attacker in the Future in 100-400 years is able to touch the Satoshi funds, supposedly Satoshi. And is able to use the funds or exchange them to other currency at that given time. This way the attacker gains unbelievable wealth and control over government, people, the world. End result: CATASTROPHE. Financial domination of the world, wars funded by private person.

&amp;#x200B;

How to prevent:

In case the creator of Bitcoin is in a such program that allows him to bypass hundreds of years, (for example the Alcor Life Extension Foundation) we must proceed and block all funds created and mined by Satoshi Nakamoto to prevent such an attempted attack on the world. The so called genesis block funds that satoshi holds still as of today, must be blocked permanently to prevent a catastrophic attack on the world's financial system in case the creator of Bitcoin have malicious intention to ruin the world in the far future.

&amp;#x200B;

Why should we do this?

Because this is the only legal and legitimate way of thanking Satoshi his heritage, Bitcoin. If we want to serve man kind we must block these funds to prevent such attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

But won't an exchange get hacked with over million bitcoins be the same problem?

No, we can track them, Satoshi's funds are legal and legitimately mined bitcoin if he can access the funds then he will be able to change the world order for the better or for the worst. Therefore we must prevent this from happening.",1537078099,16/09/2018 06:08:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9g8gbj/block_satoshi_funds_to_prevent_future_attacks/,1

"Will Lightning Network save the Bitcoin, or will we see another coin take over?","Hey guys,

I just wanted to ask a simple question to everyone and hear the community thoughts. The way BTC is now, I don't see it remaining the dominant crypto coin in a few years. Mainly due to fungibility, lack of privacy and scalability issues. Blockchain layers promise to solve these issues (like he Lightning network), but at the end of the day, do you personally believe these layers will be successfully implemented and solve our problems, or we will simply let a new Coin take over?

&amp;#x200B;

Walkaway campaign? banned by Facebook? Censorship resistance is not just for bitcoin.,"I will speak from the heart now, please give me some leeway. Bitcoin tech is SOUND i mean really sound (will cover this later in an interview)  at the heart bitcoin rocks because

1. **Limited supply** barring a near unanimous consensus (where it would be so obvious and UNhurtful to adjust for some hypethetical reason.)
2. **Censorship Resistance** \- i.e. fungible .. all bitcoins are treated equally.
3. **Private contract ability** \- our ability to TX and contract unencumbered by fear or coercion. (i.e. a true free market - TX without a 3rd party)

If society continues **down the path of accepting censorship** (pls youtube 'facebook banned"" or ""twitter banned"" and sort by date.. it's now a constant stream. Pretty soon however they will ban those that even discuss who was banned.  I don't like where this end and It scares me.

As bitcoiners we require SOME SEMBLANCE OF CIVILITY or it's all for naut.  Without a shred of social support for the principles we are investing in we don't stand a chance and like I have said for quite some time.. IF bitcoin ends up failing, you will not want to live in the aftermath.  It means we lost our only chance to govern our own affairs down to the brand of toothpaste.

&amp;#x200B;

But **we, 'empathetic human beings who love one another"" will win**. This censorship and tyranny and jailing of whistle blowers etc.. Has no real base. Who has more to lose a person being enslaved or a person supporting slavery?

The status quo / corporate oligarchy is highly leveraged using main stream media and now social media MODERATION power. The financial system has never been more leveraged and neither is their agendas of force. WALK AWAY apparently (i just found out about this campaign) at it's heart is about **unifying people based on** **principles not POLITICS** (party lines) so it's no surprise to me they banned him on facebook.

Please help me in *whatever way you think is best* to spread the word  and support the principles of individual freedom so we can Enjoy and Party with one another,  rather than enter some mad max dystopic future in tears.

What is the benefit of Bitcoin to a G10 country?,"Hey Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I am the head of new products and researching them at a very large financial company. Blockchain and all this technology sounds amazing on paper but from a practical standpoint, I do not see the use case. I am trying to pitch a case to open a bitcoin trading desk here but I am finding myself at crossroads. Volume on futures is low and I am aware of all the physical and non-physical futures that are running and upcoming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a G10 currency country and see no reason for any self-sufficient country  to switch to bitcoin. The ledger system that does not allow for anything to be changed sounds good in theory but some things do need to be changed or ammended. 

&amp;#x200B;

If one of my wallets gets hacked, I am at a loss. If my identity gets stolen, the banks generally have my back. 

Governments can seize my assets.. If the government can seize my assets, they did so for a reason and this is more an arguement for criminals. 

Sending money oversees is a light in my dark bitcoin tunnel but it is not enough justification. 

&amp;#x200B;

An associate told me reddit was a place that has lots of passion for bitcoin. Give me your best shot.

Convince me to open this bitcoin desk!

An Alluring New Asset Class For Bitcoin,[removed],1537134910,16/09/2018 21:55:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9gek7u/an_alluring_new_asset_class_for_bitcoin/,1
Improving Finland's crypto taxation,"In early July 2018, Finland introduced one of the most punitive crypto taxation schemes in the world.

1. All Bitcoin/crypto transactions are taxable events, and taxed against euro value.
2. All wins are taxed as capital gains.
3. Losses are not deductible.
4. Mining income is considered salary for taxation purposes.

The new tax rules single-handedly killed the industry in Finland. Nobody in their right mind would daytrade with this taxation, and even buying coffee with BTC would be a taxable event. I wrote multiple popular blogs about the topic, saying that this move will cause a lot of harm down the road, as Bitcoin and blockchain-based business grows and Finland will be left out completely. 

  
The lobbying worked and the tax administration took notice. On Monday the 17th of September, we have 4 of the country's leading blockchain activists gathered together with the tax administration to discuss changes. The crypto-community is still small, so we have to keep talking publicly about the importance of this industry to help the governments make better decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Altcoinstalks - the best forum about crypto-currencies,"Friends - today I will tell you about one remarkable crypto-currency forum, which is rapidly gaining popularity and whose audience is growing every day. How do you understand this forum, which as its primary goal sets itself the task of systematizing all information about the main crypto-currencies and also bringing together first-class crypto enthusiasts capable of developing and moving this market forward.

To date, the audience of the forum is more than 30000 people and is growing rapidly, as Altcominstalks has many advantages. Of course, it's not a secret for anyone that the main palm of the championship is occupied by another crypto-exchange forum Bitcointalks, which began its work many years ago and gained frenzied popularity, but due to its wrong policy, many of the old forum participants flee from there, and those who are there still remains increasingly express their dissatisfaction. I myself do not want to go to Bitcointalks once again and suggest that you consider the main disadvantages of this forum.

Entering merits - for many this moment is of paramount importance. In early 2018, the ranking system was changed at the oldest forum and merits were introduced. Before they appeared, it was enough to just be active in the forum and eventually raise your rank. After the innovation to obtain the next rank, you needed more and more merits. For the rank member - 10; for the rank of full member - 100 and so on ... I did not specifically continue the whole ladder, since even getting the member was almost impossible.

Why do you ask - because users who had large ranks before the introduction of merits automatically appeared last and they for quality posts should reward them with other participants. The answer lies precisely in the fact that they should not mean giving. To get a merit on the forum is almost impossible - you can write at least 10 super useful and useful posts for 1000 words, but you will not get anything in the end, but all because these merits are sold.



Why give free what you can sell?

The price ranges from 400 to 1000 rubles per 1 merit - a good business is not it, after making a simple calculation it becomes clear that the ""owners"" Bitcointalks simply decided to shut themselves off from the whole mass of new people and enrich themselves. For example, when reaching the Legendary rank, the user had in the piggy bank 1000 merits, which even sold at a minimum price of 400 rubles, he became much richer and why they are just so give ...

Boorish attitude - from the first problem automatically follows the second, when the same top, which introduced merits felt like kings. They have the right to paint any user of the trust for fictitious reasons, insult you and proudly lifted their heads and put it on public display. Behind the apex their gang is tightened, which introduced a normative non-official communication on the forum and not at all a partial favor to other participants.

Struggling with quality content - as it is not paradoxical, but Bitcointalks has lost its main advantage and has ceased to carry the function of enlightenment and discussion of information. Many times I encountered how the quality and useful topics that were available for a long time at the forum were simply removed from the forum under various far-fetched pretexts. As an explanation for such a step, the wording about the existence of a similar topic (plagiarism) is most often used, but in fact the exposed reason is very twisted. But in an infinite number of topics there are multiplying themes that do not carry a semantic load and lead to the same comments only for stuffing messages for the subscription.

Forget what merits are and move to a bright future together with Altcoinstalks !!!

Altcoinstalks - new crypto-exchange forum
I like many other users for the first time on the forum Altcoinstalks immediately felt at ease. It felt like I knew everything here, that I was at home and could relax. The former vanity vanished immediately and it was time to really get to know new people. And all because the interface here is much more understandable and friendly, the forum engine works much faster and more efficiently and it's not just empty words, you can right now look at the site with your own eyes by clicking on the https://www.altcoinstalks.com/index.php?action=refferals;refferedby=37893.

A long time to understand the structure of the forum also did not have to, here everything is much clearer and easier. Separately, a branch on the bounty, separate branches of discussions kriptovalyut and naturally local branches in different languages. I was very surprised by the friendly atmosphere that exists on the forum. Of course, I spend more time in the Russian-language branch and for a comparatively small amount of time I have already found like-minded people. You will receive an answer to any of your questions, and you can answer both the forum administration and ordinary users. Also you can ask a question and the main ADMIN forum and get a clear answer, where you still meet this !!!

Altcoinstalks has just started its development path and, for increasing its audience, intelligently conducts various marketing moves and promotions - in other words, the forum administration constantly develops and modernizes Altcoinstalks, it does not stand still, which is also pleasantly surprising. I suggest you consider the advantages of this forum, which without exaggeration will play a positive role in the development and prosperity of the new crypto-currency community.

Convenient and quick pumping - in order to start your career ladder on this forum you just need to register, which takes 2 minutes and start writing posts or comments. There is no restriction on the time spent on the forum for obtaining a certain rank, but there is only the number of your posts.

So to achieve the rank of Jr. Member needs only 20 posts; Full Member needs 60 posts; Sr. Member needs 120 posts; Hero Member needs 500 posts, and for Legendary 1000 posts. Also there is karma for each user. For useful comments and posts, other users can put you pluses to karma and negative to negative accordingly. Such an opportunity is given to any user who has received the rank of Sr. member. Karma does not give much privileges at this stage, with the exception of additional bonuses for airdrops from the forum. In more detail, positive karma increases the chances of getting a random bonus in tokens from the administration, i. E. the positive karma itself is not paid for, but simply increases the chance of a bonus. More ""+"" karma, more lottery tickets.

Also each user accumulates points POINTS, which accumulate over time and proportionally depend on your activity on the forum - the more often you write, the more POINTS you get.



Ayrdrops and bonuses on the forum - today the forum is replete with a lot of different airdrops and bounty, both for beginners and for seasoned users. The forum is constantly growing audience and there are more and more new buns for them. Here are just the main bonuses that you can now use:

main airdrop-get tokens of the forum ALTS and ALTT for activity on the forum. Creation of high-quality content and the development of the forum gives you the opportunity to exchange once every few months earned POINTS, karma for forum tokens. If you store them in your purses and do not sell, then you will be paid additional various tokens collected by the forum. More details you can read here;
contest for creating articles and videos about the forum - creating your own content and distributing information about the forum you can earn valuable prizes and various tokens such as ALTS, SPARTA and others. More details you can read here;
Royalty and Patron - support the forum financially and get one of these statuses that give you an increase from 10% to 40% on any airdrop. More details you can read here;
airdrop for beginners - forum participants who have fewer than 10 messages can simply fill out the form to get 10 ALTT tokens. More details you can read here;
referral system - each user of the forum has a referral link and for each reduced user on your link you get 60 ALTS. If this article was useful for you, then you can podderat author and register for my referral link;
subscription companies - everyone can already participate today in subscription companies on the forum, and it is not difficult to pump their rank here. Currently, there are several good companies, where you have the opportunity to receive not only tokens, but also real money (for example Tartaria).


In conclusion, I would like to add that for today Altcoinstalks is the fastest growing forum dedicated to crypto-currencies. Current actions and airdrops contribute to increasing interest in this forum, not only in the short term, but also in the long term. So the ALTS tokens that you can earn and sell on the exchange will bring you more use if you leave them on your wallet for a long time. In the future, the price of the token will increase and it will become harder and harder to earn it, since its distribution has a complexity bomb, and only a small part of all the planned ones is issued.

Friends - I advise everyone to think about the future and register as soon as possible. You see how quickly everything changes in the crypto-currency world and how quickly this forum is gaining popularity. Register on the forum and start changing your future, you can at this link, and if you doubt, then join the social networks of the project, so as not to miss all kinds of shares and be up to date with news.",1537143616,17/09/2018 00:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9gfm2e/altcoinstalks_the_best_forum_about/,1

New Exchange To Offer Decentralized BTC Dark Pool Trading With KYC Integration,"This past Friday, an article was released (https://medium.com/republicprotocol/republic-protocol-partners-with-wyre-1ccdedaa296d) detailing some specifics around a soon-to-be-launched decentralized Dark Pool exchange called RenEx that will likely enable a healthy increase in BTC trading volume. 

For anyone unfamiliar, RenEx is being built on top of the Republic Protocol, a protocol designed to power dark pool exchanges. REN is a utility token for the protocol that provides fuel and security to the engine.

But what’s more interesting is a recent collaboration between the RenEx exchange and a company called Wyre. Wyre’s decision to partner with the Republic Protocol / RenEx team is exciting for a few different reasons:

First, these guys have an OTC desk that is going to be on boarded onto the RenEx platform, providing (what I would assume to be) a pretty substantial amount of liquidity. Wyre formally announced their OTC desk back in May of this year, but has traded $3.5 billion in cryptocurrency assets in-house since 2013. 

Perhaps even more interesting... Wyre is also going to provide Know-your-customer (KYC) and Anti-money laundering (AML) services to the RenEx exchange. At the end of the day, this will be the first DECENTRALIZED Dark Pool Crypto exchange offering users a level of compliance that’s consistent with big banks working in traditional financial markets. A statement released by Wyre included the following, which, in my opinion, did a great job at capturing the potential impact that this could have on BTC and other Crypto markets:

“We can’t overstate how excited we are to be able to leverage our unique combination of payments infrastructure and legal compliance services to help bring Republic Protocol’s offering to life. As Republic Protocol CEO Taiyang Zhang noted, this represents the shared focus of the two teams ‘on facilitating the entry of traditional institutional investors and funds to provide the increased liquidity digital asset markets need to grow and flourish.’” (https://blog.sendwyre.com/republic-protocol-partners-with-wyre-to-provide-liquidity-for-decentralized-cryptocurrency-dark-4248e4912b77)

Did Roger Ver illegally evade US exit taxes? What about guys like Brock Pierce and Michael Terpin that moved to PR?,"If a US citizen renounces their citizenship, they need to pay an exit tax on all of their assets. Did Roger Ver ever do this or did he not claim his cryptocurrency assets?

Similarly, those moving to Puerto Rico to keep their citizenship but avoid federal income taxes are supposed to pay federal taxes on the current value of their assets if they ever sell them. For example, if you own 1 bitcoin worth $6,500 and sell it in one year for $106,500, you owe 10% Puerto Rico tax on the $6,500, federal long term capital gains tax on the $6,500 (10% paid to PR can be deducted from this amount), and pay 0% on the $100,000.

If bitcoin stays at $6,500, well, you just wasted all that effort moving to Puerto Rico for nothing because you'll pay the same amount that you would have paid in the states. Right? So if that's the case, how does this really help guys like Terpin and Pierce unless they wait for the price to go up?",1537167275,17/09/2018 06:54:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9gi2t3/did_roger_ver_illegally_evade_us_exit_taxes_what/,1

"1 Merchant, 20 Customers, 1 weekly payment per customer. Best system for the merchant to check the weekly payments?","Imagine that I will receive weekly, bitcoin payments, from 20 friends. Value per payment is 0.010 BTC.

What is the best solution to follow up these payments?

First I was thinking to create 20 bitcoin addresses and link 1 address to 1 friend.

Are there wallets what lett you create 20, or more address at the same time, but all controlled by 1 wallet?

Or are there better systems?

Maybe Lightning is a better option? Are there tools for easy create customized invoices? I can create than every week, per member, a unique invoice, and I can follow up if the invoice is paid.

I know it's possible in LN wallet to create manual an invoice. Maybe 20 per week is achievable, but if more, a tool will be very easy.

I really have no idea what the best solution can be.

Maybe I forget the most logical solution.

Or maybe this is a software problem, and do I need a program, or programmer what can write the code for me?

And if possible, the operating system where everything works on, have to be android, or standard windows 10.

Bisq - the decentralized exchange," 

1. **Censorship resistance**
2. **Privacy**
3. **User control of funds**

These are the 3 key reasons why decentralized exchanges are fundamental for Bitcoin to succeed. They are not theoretical risks, but very real threats: We have hundreds of examples of users losing funds after ceding control to a custodial exchange. We have dozen of cases of goverments blocking or regulating exchanges out of existence. And we have an ever increasing number of exchanges being forced or choosing to invade user privacy through KYC, AML and other intrusive (and exclusive) requirements... and then leaking or selling that information.

Bisq is currently the best available option to exchange Bitcoin without sacrificing privacy, ceding control of your bitcoins to a third party or allowing censorship of any kind.

1. Bisq cannot is **censorship-resistant**: it runs over TOR and cannot be shut down or regulated. It is not a company or website, but rather a P2P network similar to BitTorrent or Bitcoin.
2. Bisq **does not require nor collect your personal information** \- it is stored locally on your computer and only what is strictly necessary to complete a trade is shared with your counterpart in each trade. There is no central respository of user info.
3. Bisq **never touches your funds** \-  bitcoins are under your control in your own wallet and only locked up in a multi-sig transaction during the execution of each trade. Fiat funds are sent directly from the buyer to the seller without involving a third party.

If you want to help Bisq grow on **September 20th** there will be a market Kick-start day to push liquidity. Please post a offer to buy/sell on that day to show your interest.

Why is no one using BitShares (BTS) decentralized exchange?,"Why does everyone praise Bisq when there’s already a better decentralized exchange with more volume that is also top 30 crypto right now? 

I’m talking about BitShares (BTS). 

It was created by the same guy who created EOS and Steem. 

There seems to be decent volume on there, but for how powerful the exchange is, I don’t see why more people aren’t using it? 

Plus there are other decentralized exchanges built on top of BitShares like OpenLedger and a bunch of others, which increases the value of BTS. 

All the coins on BTS DEX is backed by 1.75x the value of the amount of BTS, so compared to tether, bitUSD (which represents the value of $1 on the BTS DEX) is actually backed by BTS itself. 

You can also easily use your BTS to get a loan to purchase more coin and get a margin. Of course that can be risky like any other margin trading, but it is very easy to sign up and there is no KYC or anything like that.

Want 10 Bitcoin stickers for a dollar?,"Sticker Mule is having a promotion for a 10-pack of 3""x3"" custom die-cut vinyl stickers for a dollar with free shipping, use the discount link (not a referral) here: [https://www.stickermule.com/p/640b6ab4](https://www.stickermule.com/p/640b6ab4)

If you're skeptical about the deal check out the discussion n vetting over on slickdeals here: [https://slickdeals.net/f/12049755-1-for-10-custom-stickers-fs](https://slickdeals.net/f/12049755-1-for-10-custom-stickers-fs)

For an image, just google your favorite style of the icon, and after you upload specify in the instructions that you'd want the die-cut to just go around the border of the icon

Lastly, the deal can only be used for one sticker pack per email, but I made another account with the same shipping address and credit card and successfully ordered another set, so, go wild!

Update: if you use my referral link you also get a $10 credit just for signing up (which is useless for purchases under $30), but I get $10 too, sooooo, shameless plug :D [https://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref\_id=4800011701&amp;utm\_medium=link&amp;utm\_source=invite](https://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=4800011701&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=invite)",1537227016,17/09/2018 23:30:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9gph82/want_10_bitcoin_stickers_for_a_dollar/,1

This time, however, unlike the usual good announcements made by the platform, Robinhood is alleged of selling user data to high-frequency trading (HFT)firms.  


The news hit the space right after Robinhood disclosed their financial report for the second quarter of 2018 in order to abide by the Securities and Exchanges Commission Rule 606. The report spread like wildfire with many claiming that the platform is selling their customers orders and earning millions by doing so. However, regarding the matter, the Head of Communications of Robinhood, Jack Randall issued an official statement on behalf of Robinhood on Twitter. The statement claims that Robinhood, alongside other licensed brokerages, is required to execute customer orders at the best available price across every regional and national stock exchange as it is required by the Federal Law.",1537242863,18/09/2018 03:54:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9grfn0/robinhood_said_they_do_not_sell_customer/,1

Nulltx posted an article today to clarify the FAKE VOLUME allegation upon OKEx, the world-leading digital asset exchange. According to nulltx, the main proof is that OKEx has a long-term program called Happy Friday, a bonus distribution campaign that to give away 50% of its trading fee to OKB (OKEx platform token) holders weekly. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if OKEx has washed trade grossly from $10 billion to $20 billion, meantime the trading commission raised from $5 million to $10 million (assumptive), then it needs to pay the extra $7.5 million from their own pocket. Why would OKEx make fake volume of the $20 billion? Hope the rumors will stop from the wise man's mouth.

One day while trying to access my account I realised that it was blocked (see the screenshot).

I left a reactivate request and then start the long process of discussion and reactivation.

I expected that that would be it, and then they requested to talk with me via skype.

P.S. Before giving all my documents, I checked that it was a real Binance site and that it was their real email to make sure I wasn’t being scammed.

**Part2:**

So I agreed and the skype call was scheduled. It took several attempts and days for me to get in contact with Binance via skype. The call rescheduled, then declined, and then finally the skype conversation happened. During the skype call, I showed additional documents with proof that it is my account and still, nothing is moving, nothing is happening. 

**Part3:**

Yesterday I sent them one more message asking about the progress with my account and got no response.

"""Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life"" - Ralph Merkle, just read in Bitcoin Standard book"," It lives because:

* It lives and breathes on the internet.
* It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive.
* It lives because it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform.
* It lives because anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code.
* It lives because all the running copies are constantly talking to each other.
* It lives because if any one copy is corrupted it is discarded, quickly and without any fuss or muss.
* It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can see its code and see exactly what it does.

### It can’t be changed

* It can’t be changed.
* It can’t be argued with.
* It can’t be tampered with.
* It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped.
* It can’t even be interrupted. If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted.
* It would continue to offer its services.
* It would continue to pay people to keep it alive.

If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted. It would continue to offer its services. It would continue to pay people to keep it alive. 

The only way to shut it down is to kill every server that hosts it. Which is hard, because a lot of servers host it, in a lot of countries, and a lot of people want to use it. 

Realistically, the only way to kill it is to make the service it offers so useless and obsolete that no one wants to use it. So obsolete that no one wants to pay for it. No one wants to host it. Then it will have no money to pay anyone. Then it will starve to death. 

But as long as there are people who want to use it, it’s very hard to kill, or corrupt, or stop, or interrupt.

I have some questions about setting up a full node/lightning node.,"Saw some sites like https://satoshitweet.com/

and https://www.lightningspin.com/

which really made me want to be able to play with Lighning on mainnet... it looks so cool, it's like getting to have the excitement of Bitcoin all over again.

So, I'm on iOS, and would like to use Union7, or Thinwallet, or whatever they're calling it.

Following the links and the FAQ, I found myself here:

https://gist.github.com/bretton/0b22a0503a9eba09df86a23f3d625c13

1. Can I do this on an old laptop with like 40G of storgage? In other words, do I need to download the full blockchain, or is it just that I *should*.

2. If I do need to run a full node to start using Lightning, how will this catch on if everyone needs a full node? I mean, I obviously I know that they don't, so how do I proceed?

3. Do I have to use an Android device? Does that solve my problem?

How do nodes verify a transaction in proof of stake?,"I know that nodes are selected to verify a block of transactions in a deterministic manner based on how many coins they have ""staked"", and that the node will lose those staked coins if they don't correctly verify the transactions inside their block.

This is what keeps nodes honest because they don't want to lose their coins, and also if they do dishonest stuff (like double spending) it damages the network which also devalues their coins.

But how **exactly** does the selected node verify those transactions? How does a node know if the transactions they are supposed to be verifying are truthful and correct?

A non-segwit batched transaction with 759 outputs was 25.989 kB,"Probably beating a dead horse by now and preaching to the choir.  FYI, this was done on LTC.  But the amount of space it takes up in the blockchain is would be the same for BTC.

1. A batched non-segwit transaction with [759 outputs was about 25.989 kB](https://insight.litecore.io/tx/f5934cadd5f4d24c8e60f9183f2b9d620f3b307c66f0b9ce5b0d9e2b163b9dc1).
2. If we assume 26 kB equates to 780 addresses, the maximum # of outputs in a 1 MB block through a single non-segwit batched transaction would be about 29,000 addresses.
3. Visa does 24,000 transactions per second.  A 10 minute block would require 14.4 million outputs just to match the demand of a global payment system that Visa is doing alone.
4. This would require at least 492 MB blocks.
5. With segwit perhaps you can divide it by 3.7 which leaves you with about 132 MB blocks.
6. In one day, this would take up 19 GB on your computer in 1 day.
7. This clearly exposes the limitations of on-chain scaling and the need for off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network.

How Can I Pay My Landlord in Bitcoin? (With Him Receiving Usd),"Hello,

I have reached a point in my life where I am slowly selling off some of my Crypto/Bitcoin to pay my rent every month. I was wondering if there is a more direct way of doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

E.G. Get land lords bank account information. Send BTC --&gt; service that then deposits x USD in his account.

　　Nulltx posted an article today to clarify the FAKE VOLUME allegation upon OKEx, the world-leading digital asset exchange. According to nulltx, the main proof is that OKEx has a long-term program called Happy Friday, a bonus distribution campaign that to give away 50% of its trading fee to OKB (OKEx platform token) holders weekly.

　　For example, if OKEx has washed trade grossly from $10 billion to $20 billion, meantime the trading commission raised from $5 million to $10 million (assumptive), then it needs to pay the extra $7.5 million from their own pocket. Why would OKEx make fake volume of the $20 billion?

"Customer-oriented technology as a supplement, blockchain tourism makes tourism chaos become a thing of the past","&amp;#x200B;

Global tourism is becoming an important starting point for steady growth and consumption promotion in various places. Many places have clearly defined the annual output value of tourism to exceed hundreds of billion yuan or even trillion yuan. China's tourism industry has always been the main force of GDP consumption. However, all kinds of tourism chaos have made consumers shook their heads, and blockchain tourism is in such a market environment.

The double-fire cannons of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day have allowed the tourism industry to enter the peak season. At present, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi and other places have begun to build tourism plans and determine the annual tourism revenue target, which also shows that the provinces are generally optimistic about the growth of tourism consumption. However, the golden period of tourism has always been a period of high incidence, and behind the surge in tourism consumption levels, there are hidden hidden dangers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5szufd1uy5n11.jpg

The tourism industry is a mixed bag, and there are no perfect laws and regulations and effective technical means to protect the interests of travellers. However, as early as this year's Dragon Boat Festival, the Yunnan Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce began to introduce blockchain technology to comprehensively rectify the tourism market. Through online trading supervision platform, cluster analysis was conducted on websites such as tourism shopping, scenic spots and airlines to regulate holidays. The tourism market order, initially tried to apply blockchain technology in tourism management.

However, the pain points in the tourism industry are many, how do blockchain tourism solve these pain points?

First, the most well-known core feature of the blockchain is decentralization. The application of this concept in the tourism industry is to remove intermediate agents and reduce trading links, thereby greatly reducing transaction costs and improving transaction efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/glugutgvy5n11.png

Second, the blockchain is called the value Internet, which is highly transparent and eliminates the dependence of trust. The disclosure of data information in the blockchain is conducive to ensuring the transparency of transaction costs and the authenticity of products and services.

Third, the autonomy of the blockchain is reflected in the tourism industry. Visitors can have multiple identities. Visitors are not only tourists, but also judges and managers. They can exchange local tourism and service information through blockchains, and Attractions and product sellers are rated for review.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g9mknuxxy5n11.png

Fourth, the blockchain has non-defective modification. In the past, hotels, travel agencies, etc. competed for customers and made false evaluations of seller services on the online platform, so that tourists could not obtain real information. The unsuccessful modification of the blockchain technology effectively avoids the spread of such false information, because as long as false information appears, the traceability can be traced on the chain, which will have an important impact on the credit and transaction of the person who publishes the false information.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cj0rzs1zy5n11.jpg

Today's blockchain tourism platform is still young. Although the blockchain travel platform headed by the LEOOY in China is not afraid of tigers, there is still room for hard work in technology. After all, it is not easy to land Utopia dreams. Blockchain technology has indeed opened up new possibilities for the development of tourism. But in fact, for long-term development, only customer-oriented, providing quality tourism services, while improving technical capabilities, can promote customer trust and dependence on the tourism service industry.

\&gt; If you have any particularly sensitive keys (in our case, bitcoin private keys) try storing them entirely offline (air-gapped). Coinbase early on made a decision to store the vast majority (98%+) of customer bitcoin entirely offline, in safe deposit boxes.

'Wild West' Bitcoin 'should be regulated',"Bitcoin and other digital currencies are a ""Wild West industry"" and need to be regulated to protect investors, a committee of MPs has urged.

Problems include volatile prices, minimal consumer protection and risks of hacking and money-laundering, says the Treasury Committee.

The committee said there were no well-functioning crypto-currencies and preferred to call them ""crypto-assets"".

It urged City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority to supervise them.

At present, the FCA has no power to regulate either the issuers of these assets or the exchanges on which they are traded.

""Crypto-asset investors are currently afforded very little protection from the litany of risks. Namely, there are no formal mechanisms for consumer redress, nor compensation,"" said the committee.

Tour in Mining Farms in Georgia.,"  

Hello everyone !

Maybe you have already heard about Georgia crypto mining industry (if not check the article bellow ;) ). I am planning to organize a tour in mining farms in Georgia. Everyone who is interested in mining opportunities and advantages in Georgia, has a chance to take a look from inside the farm.

Tours may include detailed information about how the farms are set up, what are the costs of running a farm here and also you'll have an opportunity to discuss your ideas to other interested investors and maybe start a business with joined forces :)

"Same old wish, different reason","Just came here to wish the same thing everyone else does, but for a different reason: I wish I had known about BTC back when it was practically (financially) worthless, somehow didn’t lose it all to MTGOX, and had F.U. money worth of BTC now so that I could do more to help the network, experiment, and generally mess around on a meaningful level.

I find this stuff so interesting and really believe in the tech and want it to succeed. I run a full node and set up a LN node but I want to put so much more in than the fraction of a BTC I have in now. My LN node hasn’t actually transmitted a single payment in 22 days now, despite being 1sat/byte. I’m assuming it’s b/c frankly my channels aren’t that big or useful. Connecting to the large nodes seem silly because all of the large nodes are already connected to each other directly with very well funded channels of their own. I look forward to Atomic Multipath Payments in LN so that every little channel really can contribute proportionally. BTC isn’t really running at full capacity throughout the day either, and so people probably aren't as compelled to try out LN yet.

Not sure what my point is - just thinking out loud. Well, I'm typing so I guess it's not out loud. This is getting deep.",1537365698,19/09/2018 14:01:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9h5egd/same_old_wish_different_reason/,1

&amp;#x200B;

Needed to change the RaspiBlitz script to install the Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 instead of the now unavailable 17.0-RC3.

For the HDD I used this X820 expnsion board [http://www.raspberrypiwiki.com/index.php/X820](http://www.raspberrypiwiki.com/index.php/X820).

This way only one power source is needed and will be nice and compact once housed without the LCD on.

So here is my question, let's say I bought $1000 worth of Bitcoins and over a year's time the value has gone up significantly. Instead of selling them like a stock or a currency trader, I have made numerous small purchases with it and spend it all over the course of 1 year. Every purchase is done on a different day with a different Bitcoin value. Does the IRS seriously want me to itemize every single transaction?

How much would it cost for a miner to exploit the Denial-of-Service bug that was fixed in 0.16.3?,"From my understanding, the miner would have to independently mine a full block using their own mining software that would not accept the mining reward and that very block must contain 2 transactions using the same input.

The total cost would be something like:
 - Electricity and mining equipment with enough hashpower to give them a chance of independently mining a full block.
 - 12.5 XBT of unredeemed mining reward
 - The cost of sending multiple transactions with the same input, these would probably have high fees in order to increase likelihood of them ending up in the same block.

The cost of this would be tremendous.  My guess would be way over $10M!

"Bitcoin Daily: Bitcoin A Lifeline To Palestinians; NY AG Questions Legality Of Binance, Kraken","Some users in the occupied Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are turning to crypto dealers to buy bitcoin to purchase investments abroad.

Since Palestinians cannot send money directly to online crypto exchanges because none work with local banks, locals rely on dealers to act as “liquidity gateways.”

Ahmed Ismail, a financial analyst in Gaza, said there are at least 20 unofficial “exchange” offices in the region dealing cryptocurrency to locals. And one currency dealer in Gaza told CoinDesk that over the past four years he helped up to 50 families a month purchase an average of $500 worth of bitcoin each to send money abroad or shop online.

“Bitcoin, in their opinion, is cheaper, safer, and quicker,” he said. “Nothing works with Palestinian banks. Bitcoin wallets are alternative banks.”

In other news, CoinDesk reported that the $1 billion blockchain fund backed by the Chinese city of Hangzhou’s government is getting ready to roll out a Japanese yen-pegged stablecoin.

Yao Yongjie, one of the founding partners of the Xiong’An (Grandshores) Blockchain Fund, revealed that plans are already underway, with the stablecoin expected to launch by the end of this year or early 2019. Grandshores Technology – also chaired by Yao – is planning to raise HK$100 million ($12.7 million) to help finance the project.",1537389904,19/09/2018 20:45:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9h8w78/bitcoin_daily_bitcoin_a_lifeline_to_palestinians/,1

Bitcoin vs Stablecoins,"It seems every day a new stablecoin is announced. It seems to be the new thing trying to challenge USDT. I think theses ‘stable’ coins won’t be so stable after all. Many of them will turn out to be scams and others will face serious difficulties. There will be an active market valuing them based on their risks. They value be measured against how much BTC you can buy with them and not their dollar value ironically. Slowly people will realize that BTC is the unit of account against which all other crypto coins (already the case), all stable coins, and ultimately all inflating fiat currencies will be measured.

Coinstaker just posted an article to clarify the fake volume allegation upon OKEx, the world-leading digital asset exchange. According to Coinstaker, OKEx has absolutely no purpose to fake the volume. The main evidence is that OKEx has a long-term program called Happy Friday, a bonus distribution campaign that to give away 50% of its trading fee to OKB (OKEx platform token) holders weekly. The program has distributed approximately $5 million last week. If OKEx has washed trade grossly to reach the volume, the exchange will need to pay most of the bonus to users with its own money, then why would OKEx make fake volume?

"How does the mining software ""guess"" the correct nonce?","Hello,

I was giving a tutorial to my friend about how Bitcoin works and he had a few good questions I couldn't answer definitively.

I was explaining how a miner ""guesses"" randomly to solve a hash/puzzle.  He is aware of how hashing works.  I told him how the miner is trying to guess an input to get a desired output of a certain amount of leading zeros.  Here are some scenarios he laid out and my answers to them.  Was I correct?

Q1: If I'm a miner with multiple machines, why wouldn't I tell each machine to guess random numbers within a certain range, with each range being different?  That way I don't waste time or energy potentially guessing a number I already tried.

A1: The amount of numbers to guess is infinite, even if one machine had a range of [1-100000000000], the other would have to guess between [100000000001-infinity], the amount of energy or time saved would be insignificant.

Q2: They could set a range for each machine that didn't go to infinity, so one machine could randomly guess from [1-9999], the second machine could guess [10000-19999], and when the first machine finished its first range, it could go to [20000-29999] and so on.

A2: When guessing from a range of numbers that stretch to infinity, the chances of guessing the same number twice are so small that it likely doesn't matter at all, and devoting even that little amount of power or memory to have the miners switch alternating sets is a worse trade off then potentially guessing an already guessed number.

Are my answers to the above scenarios correct?  If not, why?  And am I missing a fundamental of mining (for instance, we are assuming you can even edit the process in which a miner mines)?

I have already successfully answered two of his other scenarios:

Q: Why don't they guess linearly to avoid guessing a number twice?

A: Because if someone else is doing the same thing, but quicker, you guarantee you will never successfully mine a block.

And

Q: Why doesn't a miner with multiple machines keep track of which numbers are guessed and communicate that to all of his machines to avoid guessing the same number?

A: It would definitely take more resources to store and communicate that information than it would save to avoid guessing the same number twice.",1537422798,20/09/2018 05:53:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hcr56/how_does_the_mining_software_guess_the_correct/,1

Assuming Bitcoin gets mass adoption (Bakkt, ETFs, blah blah), is it guaranteed that the price will increase much (ie. 20k or more) from what it is today? I mean, what is the logic behind this reasoning? Couldn't the current price already by inflated a lot?

Best ways to educate customers on how to pay with BTC,"I run [cosmicnootropic.com](https://cosmicnootropic.com) and we use BTC and other crypto as a method of payment because:

1) MasterCard and Visa do not allow any transactions for any medicine-related products. (Even though it is legal)

2)  Our customers are located in other countries. 

3) We are located in Russia. (High-risk destination nowadays)

&amp;#x200B;

Many customers ask us how they can pay with BTC and we usually forward them to this or some similar guide: [https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/en/buy-bitcoin-credit-debit-card/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/en/buy-bitcoin-credit-debit-card/)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any other way how people with no experience can pay with BTC without major problems?

Question about Seed Words,"1. I use electrum as wallet and want to create a wallet for long term storage.  ""What happens"" if electrum disappears and I can't get hold of an old version, say, ten years down the line?  Is my wallet gone, or is the way that the seed phrase is converted to a private key some kind of standard that will work everywhere?

2. Electrum gives the option of an extra phrase to add to the seed phrase.  It gives me the option to write down the seed phrase, but keep the extra phrase in my head as extra security in case someone discovers my written down phrase.  This phrase or word or words will be something I won't forget and which won't be easily guessable by someone else.  How easy will it be for someone to brute force my wallet if they find my seed phrase, but not my extra phrase kept in my head?

Bitcoin mining opportunities in Georgia and tours in mining farms.,"Want to have a discussion about mining advantages in Georgia.

Each country has its advantages and disadvantages for crypto mining and I want to inform you about my country.

Wrote an article about it and I am open for suggestions.

See the link for the article: [https://blocknews.ge/georgia/tbilisi-the-capital-of-crypto-mining-ig](https://blocknews.ge/georgia/tbilisi-the-capital-of-crypto-mining-ig)

&amp;#x200B;

 

I am planning to organize a tour in mining farms in Georgia. Everyone who is interested in mining opportunities and advantages in Georgia, has a chance to take a look from inside the farm.

Tours may include detailed information about how the farms are set up, what are the costs of running a farm here and also you'll have an opportunity to discuss your ideas to other interested investors and maybe start a business with joined forces :)

POS app ‘Pay me with Bitcoin’ now supports Lightning Network ⚡(emphasis on Venezuela),"Hi all,

I have just updated the free POS app ‘Pay me with Bitcoin’ to support Lightning Network, with the help of [OpenNode.co](https://opennode.co/about).

* You can use USD, EUR, VEF and ARD as fiats currencies along Bitcoin (more currencies coming).
* No private keys are required, so is ideal for business and places where employees bring their own devices.
* The app is focused on Venezuelans because it uses market prices for Bolivar-Bitcoin conversions (powered by [BitcoinVenezuela.com](https://www.bitcoinvenezuela.com/), and its sibling ONG).

Availabe in [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.salvadorjesus.PagameConBitcoin) and [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/pagame-con-bitcoin/9pct6mjrghdm) (desktop and mobile).

We have put a lot of effort into making this app. We hope to help people improve their lives with Bitcoin! Please help us by sharing the app with people who might find it useful!

You can read a bit more about the app in this post:

Basic Bitcoin questions I don't have the answer to... Can you help?,"Hello all,

I'm not a technical person, and don't have the knowledge to answer the majority of questions when (trying) to debate Bitcoin with my colleagues...  
I was wondering if you could help...

1 - Bitcoin is a coin that has to be mined and because the total amount of Bitcoins will be 21 million, people will mine it till then... but what will happen after all coins are mined?

2 - Currently, Bitcoin is a Proof of work coin, meaning that all the transactions have to be validated via Proof of work (mining?!) ... so again, once all the coins are mined, how will transactions be validated if there are no more bitcoins to be earned through mining? Will it be adapted to a different validation protocol?

3 - Energy efficiency is another big topic. I understand it consumes a lot of energy to process the current transactions and mining at this point, but again, once all coins are mined, will this still be an issue?

4 - Lightning network is now available which means that transactions work in a slightly different way making bitcoin much more scalable. At  the same time (values may be very incorrect) a lightning network transaction fee should cost about 1$, in comparison to the 50$ per transaction we saw for Bitcoin in the past. These values are still far a way from the advertised ""free"" transactions. How will this value become zero (or very close to it)?

4.1 - Alternatively, we can see Bitcoin as a store of value, a kind of virtual gold, instead as a crypto currency for a daily use, as there seem to be other coins/projects that aim to have zero $ and instant transactions. In this case, how would Bitcoin be valued? meaning, what would be it's intrinsic value (if this makes any sense)?

5 - Supposing that Bitcoin will be ""the"" currency in the near future and knowing that one needs to have the private key to transfer his coins... What would happen if a person that holds 1 BTC dies. How would this be passed on to his family/kids? Or would these be lost for ever?

6 - this one is more of a ""let me know /share any links""... is there any website where I can find data comparisons like Bitcoin vs baking Costs/Energy consumption/ transactions $, Bitcoin transaction volume by country across the years...?

😊👍 They want to add this to their agenda already this fall, which is really good news!!

Weirdest transaction ever.,"Hi guys, i just bought some BCH and provided the legacy address. The source i bought it from sent it to this address and it got converted to the CashAddress(which my wallet provided don't support). I've been trying to recover the coins by claiming it through different wallet provided with my private key. The problem i found is that somehow the coins got sent to a different account straight out of my CashAddress the moment it got in(see attachment). I obviously didn't do that, and what i can't understand is how could it get sent out of my account in the same time?

The sender and wallet provided don't take any responsibility and iv'e got no answers. Would appreciate your help!

New AI Crypto Mining Software for Gamers goes into Alpha!,"I have been keeping an eye on this relatively new company, which promises a next gen peace of mining software for the average gamer.

[ Taken from Gaimin Onepager ](https://i.redd.it/1wi7onhnwfn11.png)

It scans all mine-able cryptos and selects the most profitable one and mines adapting to the resources you have free.

So if you happen to be gaming it automatically tunes down the mining power to not affect the game play at all and the second you stop gaming it increases it again, to me that sounds pretty neat.

&amp;#x200B;

This would allow gamers to simply mine without being affected by it. So a simple program running in the background not disturbing your workflow while earning you a few nice dollars.

Just thought, it would be something cool you guys might be interested in!

&amp;#x200B;

They just started their alpha and you can join them here:

I just tried the Bisq exchange...,"...and holy cow, does it work beautifully.

I just made my first trade without any problems whatsoever. The setup was very fast due to the fact that there is no KYC bullshit or anything like that. I just created an account with my banking information and bam, made my first decentralized BTC exchange. It runs stable and the UI seems to be bug free, which stands in stark contrast to the piece of cabbage that is the kraken.com website (their support is amazing though I must say).

And even though there are not so many active offers there at a time (today was great actually, since it was [Bisq September Market Kick-Start Day](https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/67)), I'm not worried at all that this is in fact the future of trading crypto. Try it if you haven't!

My appreciation goes out to all contributors. Well done everybody. Smashed the dono &lt;3",1537471395,20/09/2018 19:23:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hi4tw/i_just_tried_the_bisq_exchange/,1
Bitcoin Core prune not working,"Hello everyone,

I have been searching this problem on the internet for the last three hours and I wasn't able to find a solution for my problem.

For a project, I need a bitcoin core installed and sync with the blockchain. However, I do not want to store the entire chain (simply I don't have enough space on VPS) I tried to run the bitcoind with prune option but didn't work. I will list things that I have tried and didn't work, and downloaded 60GB of chain, and caused my vps to freeze &amp; reset.

* bitcoind -prune=1
* bitcoind -prune=20000
* on bitcoin.conf : ""prune=20000"" (RPC ports, user, pass settings are working, so core is getting .conf file as valid configuration but doesn't get prune value)

After these things didn't work, I tried deleting all bitcoin data and install qt wallet. And after I opened qt wallet and accessed console and run ""prune 300000"" so that it deleted the first 300K blocks (this time I set maximum space usage as 15000MB on qt wallet, still it downloaded 20GB, so I had to run prune command on console). Only then it deleted the first 300k blocks and opened up space. 

Please tell me how can I make this daemon &amp; qt wallet automaticly prune the old blockchain data when the current stored chain data reaches to certain amount?",1537471829,20/09/2018 19:30:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hi72b/bitcoin_core_prune_not_working/,1

Bitcoin ETF 21st September - Denied or Approved?,"Thought - I would share this, everyone is forgetting tomorrow’s ETF - on 21st September.

According to the SEC - 240 days maximum extension ends tomorrow for this application ref https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-07-24/html/2018-15768.htm

I think they will likely deny this one first, they cannot delayed it any further. It’s also based on leveraging bitcoin , which in turn is based on futures, which are based on exchanges that the attorney general brought to everyone’s attention, that there appears to be manlipuation.

So, it maybe expected a decision to deny is high probability, which is different to delay.

This may cause a truer panic and proper capulation, which does fit nicely for an approved ETF on the 30th, which creates the next bull run.

What’s everyone’s opinion on tomorrow’s announcement?

"Started as believer, finished as ..a profit hunter. WTF? What`s wrong with me!","A post yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9h3ynj/how_did_people_find_out_about_bitcoin_back_in_2011/) bring me back to the time I started first with bitcoin..
I can`t avoid the question - what happened? What`s wrong with me??

First I was impressed by the idea in early 2010 as it was presented in an IT forum where I`m a member. I joined the community immediately and next year I minned about 82 (or 92 not sure) BTC with my ugly home machine. It was all about the idea and with hope to change the supremacy of the bank (world) masters. Unfortunatelly I had to re-install my machine by some reason and I just ..forgot for the bitcoin - after reinstall I was like a kid realizing his favorit toy remained on the bus seat far away. (it`s a little bit worst - I still might recover the files but I have installed the core on virtual machine, there was a mania for the virtual machines at this time, lol, which make that kinda impossible) I never backup wallet or something, BTC has no value for me in sense we understand it now. It was on the end of 2010 or early 2011 and I gave up and stopped mining as it already started to consume too much sources and from some time I started it only at night. So I never installed the core anymore. In short: I left becouse I was not able to mine on my home machine anymore!

That`s important! That`s the very first point - Satoshi was wrong about the mining process and ddidn`t understand how much sources it will cost after relativelly short time. That point bring about the separation between miners and users. First I felt I am a part of the community: I am a real participant and active member of the idea. As a simple holder of the coin You can not have the same feeling, You just use it for some reason, but You`re not an active participant or creator of the future. I`m really sorry we lost that. Of corse it brings other problems as well as the concentration of the miming process to a limited group of people, energy consuming and ecological problems and so, but they are not so important as that separation we have now.

Back to the story - I was back to the BTC only in, You know - Dec 2017. For what reason? You know - to profit. Probably I will as I`m pretty sure it will hit new tops next years, but I do not want to care anymore. You think BTC is volatile? It`s not - it`s volatile only since fiat exist. We can not have two different currencies same time, for that reason now some people try to call it ""store of value"", ""kind of digital gold"" etc. IT`S NOT. It`s born to be currency and I still believe it will. If there are not dollars do You think an aplle will cost less BTC next week?! Not less as less dollars nowadays. Yes, I want mass adoption, but not in order 1 BTC to hit 1B, I want it to say good buy fiat masters. However will that happen or they will just transfer their domonation on the digital currencies? It`s sure they will try, don`t let them do.

In short again - Let You know what exacly You want! Do You really want ""to the moon""? There is no oxigen on the moon, do not forget that.",1537479315,20/09/2018 21:35:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hj8it/started_as_believer_finished_as_a_profit_hunter/,1

New info escalates importance: upgrading to 0.16.3 is REQUIRED,"0.16.3 was announced a few days ago, but if you're running a node and haven't already updated, then you really must do so as soon as possible. The bug fixed in 0.16.3 is more severe than was previously made public. You can download 0.16.3 from [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) or [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) or via [BitTorrent](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/bitcoin_core_bittorrent), and as always, make sure that you [verify the download](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/verifying_bitcoin_core).

If you only occasionally run Bitcoin Core, then it's not necessary to run out and upgrade it right this second. However, you should upgrade it before you *next* run it.

**Stored funds are not at risk,** and never were at risk. Even if the bug had been exploited to its full extent, the theoretical damage to stored funds would have been rolled back, exactly as it was in the [value overflow incident](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). However, there is currently a small risk of a chainsplit. In a chainsplit, transactions could be reversed long after they are fully confirmed. Therefore, for the next week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.

Summary of action items:

*You should not run any version of Bitcoin Core other than 0.16.3. Older versions should not exist on the network. If you know anyone who is running an older version, tell them to upgrade it ASAP.
*That said, it's not necessary to *immediately* upgrade older versions if they are currently shut down. Cold-storage wallets are safe.
*For the next ~week, consider transactions with fewer than 200 confirmations to have a low probability of being reversed (whereas usually there would be essentially zero probability of them being reversed).
*Watch for further news. If a chainsplit happens, action may be required.

The Emperor's New Crypto Clothes," 

Let’s face it: Crypto markets are naked. And it’s time to realize this mounting speculating scam was just restraining the real adoption of blockchain and the global benefits it was intended for.

https://i.redd.it/9yeij2h6thn11.jpg

And I’m talking from first line: I work in a beautiful legit project for financial inclusion based in blockchain, backed by prestigious awards and a public university. I had the opportunity to travel around Europe and Asia on early 2018 to attend major Crypto events perfectly organized, with thousand of visitors. 

It was shocking and mesmerizing at once. I met all kind of characters there: traders, pumpers and dumpers, whales, ICO advisors, tunned DJs girls turned into Women and Blockchain speakers sitting next to professional investor women, 4 Lamborghini parked outside NY venue, someone with a bulky camera pretending to be a media man and interviewing the pretty girls, smart people pretending to be dumb, dumb people unable to conceal their dumbness, businessmen at the right place and time, 100 pound fresh tuna for sashimi, teams bursting in genuine joy after collecting 50M, cloned and dull MeetUps, amazing event organizers, never ending parties, compulsive networking, automatized pitching, and lots of poker faces.

“And there was hype to rule them all, to find them, to bring them all and in the darkness bind them”. 

And now, only some months later, I noticed in just 3 days, not every hour but by the minute! how my email inbox, Telegram and LinkedIn are suddenly saturated with ICO experts, ICO promoters, ICO jugglers, Co-Founders of Blockchain Crypto Mega Events (nowadays a good photoshopped image goes miles for turning dull vaults into fancy venues). And egos aside, I’m not working for big 4’s. Actually we’ve almost been below radars because our team is too modest as to portray themselves as experts or superstars (some are entrepreneurs, some are artists, some are PhD in Economics, but none of us has been interviewed by Youtubers or so call Influencers). So, we are off the radars. The crypto radars at least.

I met a very successful and nice miner and he told me there were other times, back in 2010, when blockchain community was about dreamers and decentralization, hope and new ways of self organization. Freedom.

So, who’s going to yell: they are naked! Who is going to say Enough! Let’s get started! Let’s use this powerful tool for what it was intended to. ",1537492762,21/09/2018 01:19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hkw7t/the_emperors_new_crypto_clothes/,1

Finally Set up my own Lightning Node,"I finally set up  a Raspberry Pi Lightning Node to support the lightning network. Followed the guide by https://github.com/Stadicus which can be found here: https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/raspibolt

The guide is noob friendly, the only time I faced hiccups is because of some screw ups by myself or misreading of information given in the guide. Plus the author is also quick to respond to you if you raise issues on his github.

Total cost would be around $150 for the hardware (the only reason it is so high is because I bought a new 4TB hard drive for the node, which is unnecessary. For the current size of the blockchain - 250GB, a 500 GB hard drive would do.)

Lightning Explorer pages haven't updated yet with my node, I am not sure why. But I will link it as soon as I am able.

I have funded it with very minimal amount of BTC as I cannot afford to spend more on it at the moment. But I will be sending more funds over to support the network as soon as I am able to.

Fee free to fund my node if you guys think it's worthy. Here is the BTC address:

I am open to any questions you guys might have, though most of the set up questions have already been covered in the guide written by the original author above.",1537505832,21/09/2018 04:57:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hmbv4/finally_set_up_my_own_lightning_node/,1

Cold wallet made out of a chain,"I used a stainless steel chain to encode my 24 words master seed. Since a 24 word seed requires 24\*12 = 288 bits, the chain must have 288 links. My chain is approximately 12 feet long. Each link is either pinched/twisted (binary 1) or normal (binary 0). The decoding requires going through all the links, every 12 links (12 bits) you get a word. It's a little PITA to decode but it's a cold wallet, so I don't expect to do it very often.  I don't even bother remembering the start link nor which type of link is a binary 1 or 0 since there are at most 4 ways to decode the chain (two directions and for each direction two different interpretation of the link).

A test recovery on a HW is mandatory before declaring the chain a proper cold wallet :-)

The chain can be buried or hidden somewhere, it's not that big. It is waterproof, fireproof and do not oxidize.

What do you think? does it make any sense? How would you mark the links? (pinching, denting, twisting, etc...)

Here my chain wallet, yes, it's just a picture of a chain (!) Of course the chain in the picture is not encoded yet.

Traditional OTA enters the cold winter? LEOOY joins the tourism industry to start spring,"In the age of change, we are used to subversion. The construction of new technologies and new thinking seems to be able to smash all the winds at any time. The various industry changes that the blockchain may trigger have provoked the nerves of every practitioner, and tourism is naturally not immune. Therefore, the blockchain tourism platform represented by LEOOY is beginning to gain momentum. So, can LEOOY live up to expectations to overthrow the previous travel system?

Tourism, on the one hand, is growing at a high speed, contributing to the development of the global economy; on the other hand, it is chaotic, which seriously hinders the development of tourism. Over the years, the tourism industry has been moving forward in a contradiction. In this context, the development of simple and clear data transaction rules between suppliers and consumers seems to be the way out for the tourism industry. This is ingeniously coincident with the advantages of blockchain technology.

Many of OTA's problems arise because the centralization rights are too large, leaving consumers and travel offline providers at a disadvantage. The core concept of the blockchain is decentralization. It has the advantages of openness, transparency, consensus trust, traceability, tampering, and privacy protection. The combination with tourism is inevitably the optimal solution for the future OTA platform.

The concept of blockchain tourism has been proposed so far, and many tourism companies have begun to apply blockchain technology to their own travel platforms. LEOOY is one of the largest “blockchain+tourism” landing platforms in China. Its business covers five core functions of hotel booking, ticket reservation, scenic spot inquiry, resource sharing and social sharing, as well as insurance, finance and other The services around the CMB have made up for the lack of a comprehensive blockchain tourism platform on the market. LEOOY uses the “LEOOY Pass” as the user's independent ID card, which prevents the service provider from obtaining user information and causes the information to be resold. The user does not need to present the identity document again and again in the process of enjoying the service, which greatly enhances the identity authentication. The consumer's travel experience while protecting consumer privacy and promoting the healthy development of the industry.

In addressing the relationship between suppliers and consumers, LEOOY uses distributed computing and storage technology based on blockchain technology. Let consumers and service providers truly achieve peer-to-peer settlement, that is, consumers pay money, directly to the service provider, and the service provider collects money. No middlemen earn huge commissions.

On the most worrying credit issue of users, LEOOY packs all information permanently in the blockchain to ensure that the information cannot be modified. All information except the personal privacy information is open to everyone, ensuring that all participation behaviors and speech can be traced back. The platform will make a credit evaluation based on the user's own behavior on the platform.

On LEOOY, everyone is equal, fair and equitable. It is undeniable that with the maturity of blockchain technology and the increasing use in tourism, a group of tourism products represented by LEOOY will subvert the traditional tourism industry. Gradually realize the continuous transformation and upgrading of China's cultural tourism and eco-tourism industry, and finally form a win-win ecosystem.",1537522060,21/09/2018 09:27:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hnvgw/traditional_ota_enters_the_cold_winter_leooy/,1

Show SEC you Support a Bitcoin ETF.,"Hi investors

Good news came earlier today from the Security and Exchange Commission which issued an order to extend reflection period on a proposed rule change which, if approved, would give CBOE the green-light to launch a Bitcoin ETF.

If you like the idea of a Bitcoin ETF, why not go ahead and show your support by leaving a comment on SEC's website?

Cheers.

Help a Late Adopter Clearing up Some Concepts?," 

Hi /r/bitcoin,

I'm following the news on here for quite some time now. I found recently that I have a basic understanding about the workings of bitcoin, but there are some basic concepts that throw me off. Of course I tried to research myself, but did not get any sufficient answers, I hope you might be able and willing to clear up some points:  

x **transaction fees**  

I remember the time when people on here complained about extremely high fees that made bitcoin basically unusable for daily use (i.e. buying a coffee etc.). Recently, someone wrote about a transaction of BTC worth \~1 Mio USD for a fee of 0,09 USD. Since they sounded so surprised and I can never find any way to calculate fees beforehand online, my question is: Do you know beforehand how much BTC a transaction will cost? is there a trend? This relates to my second question:   

x l**ightning network**   

I get the basic concept of off chain transactions, but you still pay two transactions for opening and closing the channel, right (plus minor fees for the off-chain transactions)? So single transactions would be more pricy via lightning (if the fees were constant)? So a single on-chain transaction would still be the way to go?  

x **Legacy and SegWit**  

Another factor that helped reduce fees by opening up space in a block, right? So basically you want to use SegWit for your transactions, which boils down to what address your wallet has. If I want to send BTC from the exchanges build in wallet so a SegWit-wallet, would that count as a SegWit-transaction even though I don’t know if the exchange’s wallet is Legacy or SegWit? Or does only a transaction from SegWit to SegWit count as such a transaction and comes with the benefits regarding transaction fee?   

Okay, this turned out a wall of text, I hope someone finds the time and willingness to help me out.   

Thanks in advance!",1537525297,21/09/2018 10:21:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ho9fq/help_a_late_adopter_clearing_up_some_concepts/,1

Automated Bitcoin Trading as an Option for InvestmentWhile high volatility and never-closing markets may make Bitcoin trading tough, Automated Bitcoin Trading is providing a working solution for maximizing the returns in such circumstances – presumes our guest author, Susan Tindol.The cryptocurrency market is booming with new Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) being launched every day. Though the market is highly volatile, people are opting to invest in cryptocurrency due to the high amount of profits that can be made. Bitcoin, since the point of time it was launched, has come way ahead, both in terms of popularity and price.Even though its price is highly fluctuating, it has become a hot favorite for investors. Among all the cryptocurrencies launched, bitcoin firmly holds the top spot and is one of the most preferred investment instrument. However, owing to its highly volatile nature, a trader needs to be aware of the market trends every now and then. Within a short span of time, it can become highly stressful and frustrating plus takes a toll on personal life as well.Since the cryptocurrency market never sleeps; imagine one day you wake up from your deep slumber and found yourself in losses. So what is the solution? The answer to this question is [Automated Bitcoin Trading](https://rofx.group/invest-bitcoins/).

### What is Automated Bitcoin Trading?

Automated Bitcoin Trading involves automated bitcoin trading bot, which is a software program, that automatically scans the market for you and places the trade as and when the pre-set parameters are matched. This way, you don’t require to constantly keep a tap on the changing market. The automated bitcoin trading bot will do the task for you. Moreover, there is no scope of sleeping in it.These bots have become increasingly popular as it allows the traders to be in control of their cryptocurrency investments all the time. Moreover, a bot, when the parameters are specified correctly, can perform the trades at a much faster rate as compared to manually doing the same thing.

### Benefits of Opting for Automated Bitcoin Trading

There are plenty of benefits associated with automated bitcoin trading bots; some of which are outlined below:

* **Emotions Won’t come in Between:** There had been plenty of cases when we are hesitant to open and finalize a trade though it could be very beneficial for us. At most times we are afraid to pull the trigger. With automated trading, there is no scope of emotion to get involved at all. When all the trading rules are met; the deal will take place automatically. Besides this, automated trading even curbs over-trading.
* **Improved Speed of making the order:** The cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Even seconds can make a huge difference. Trading bots, since being a software, can respond immediately to the changing market trends and help you to catch on the profits which you could never have gained manually.
* **Can be backtested:** The set of rules written for an automated training bot can be tested with historical data before placing the bot on real money. This feature enables the traders to fine-tune and upgrade their trading data according to the changing market conditions.
* **Consistency in Trading:** There could be times when a trader has to suffer from losses 3-4 times in a row. This is enough to induce a psychological trauma over the trader and he/she may refrain from trading anymore, even though the next deal could have reversed all his/her losses. An automated bitcoin trading bot will be consistent in placing the trade and this way a trader can’t miss on that positive life-changing moment.

Now, you must be thinking that there would be certain disadvantages as well associated with automated bitcoin trading. Well! There are a few but with careful planning, the disadvantages can be eliminated once and for all.

* **Monitoring:** It is not the case that automated bitcoin trading won’t require monitoring. There is always a probability of issues such as connectivity failure, power loss or computer restart or computer crash. Due to these, the automated system might build up certain anomalies and if the system is not monitored for long, could result in huge losses.
* **Codes Require to be changed:** It is not the case that the code written once for a trading bot will hold for a lifetime. These set of codes are time-based and can work in one condition while in others they may not work as expected.

These disadvantages are not enough to take over the advantages that the system has. Periodical monitoring of the system can prevent mechanical issues. As far as the second disadvantage is concerned a system for automated bitcoin trading via machine learning algorithms is the solution. These machine learning algorithms can analyze and interpret the market on their own and suggest the best trading option to the user. Moreover, they learn from the trades that have been made as well as from the current market happenings.

### Conclusion

If you are just beginning out in bitcoin trading you must opt for an automated bitcoin trading system. But this doesn’t mean that you can rely completely on the system and start without knowledge. Knowledge is a must. Moreover, you can monitor the trades done by the bot and learn from them also.Overall, I recommend going for automated bitcoin trading to all bitcoin investors out there.

1775 nodes out of 9616 (18.5%) are currently on version 0.16.3. Upgrade ASAP to avoid possible chainsplit!,"Source: https://coin.dance/nodes#nodeChecker

Especially nodes running versions between 0.15 and 16.2 need to upgrade as soon as possible.  A bug could be exploited to create an invalid block that gets nonetheless validated by these older versions. This makes a chainsplit a theoretical possibility. 

A full resync with the latest software (0.16.3) showed that the bug has not yet been exploited. It probably won't happen as it isn't in the interest of the ecosystem, nor is it easy to excecute. But that's no excuse. Upgrade asap!

The strange case of Alexandre Cazes,"Alexandre Cazes, the alleged co-founder and operator of Alphabay, commited suicide in a Thai jail cell in July of last year.

The official narrative is Cazes made millions as a drug kingpin and led a lifestyle befitting someone in his position. He lived like a king in Thailand, purchasina a Lamorghini Aventador and Porsche Panamera, and acquiring citizenship by investment in a number of tax havens.

This despite the fact he used a highly transparent front to launder the proceeds of his criminal drug emporium in the form of EBX technologies, a web design company with no discernible business activity (the website hadn't been updated for well over a year at the time of his death) and a number of equally conspicuous shell companies.

How could he have laundered thousands of BTC through various banks in Thailand and never raised any red flags? Banks around the world are notoriously anti-Bitcoin, so how on earth was he allowed to move so much money without having all his accounts frozen for money laundering?

It doesn't make any sense at all that he was allowed to operate w/ impunity for close to three years, or that he'd even contemplate such a course of action. 

This leads me to conclude Cazes was most likely a patsy w/ little or no involvement with Alphabay. You'd have to view Thailand as the worst kind of banana republic to think otherwise.

What do you guys think? Was Alexandre Cazes a criminal mastermind who skirted AML laws (possibly through bribes), or just another useful idiot used by the US government to perpetuate the war on drugs and the money laundering boogeyman?",1537538515,21/09/2018 14:01:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hq6ow/the_strange_case_of_alexandre_cazes/,1

My letter to the SEC regarding the CBOE ETF," Dear SEC official,

I'm writing in favor of Bitcoin ETF approvals for a simple reason: Bitcoin is Antifragile. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't approve these ETFs, Bitcoin and crypto currencies will NOT go away. They will just move to more friendly countries and entrench in the dark web in, impossible to censor without taking the internet down, hidden networks. They will become stronger, more private, more robust and eventually American regulators will be forced to accept them back after losing the race to others and paying the huge price of being left behind for years, which count as centuries in today's rapid pace world. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the economic opportunities, wealth, jobs, advances in Fintech technologies and improved efficiencies will be enjoyed by other countries that may use it for purposes not aligned with the interests of our great country. Bitcoin was created in the United States, the greatest economy on earth, we must capitalize and monopolize it before everyone else if we are to maintain such status in the future. 

Best Regards

Comparing Bitcoin Against the Entire World’s Wealth in One Graph,"Given the 8-month long crypto bear market, lots of bitcoin naysayers are feeling smug right about now. From JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer and Nobel economist Robert Shiller, every media personality seems to think bitcoin’s downward trend will continue. There’s plenty of evidence to suggest things will turnaround, but that’s beside the point. Bitcoin in particular and the larger crypto-market in general are already substantial parts of the global economy.

Coldbit - New stainless steel seed backup design,"Hi folks.

If you own any cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin you probably know how important it is to have a backup of your seed written down on something that will survive a flood or a house fire.

After evaluating current cold storage solutions, I must say I wasn't thoroughly pleased with their quality and design. My thoughts are reflected in [Jameson Lopp's  tests of various seed backup products](https://medium.com/@lopp/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test-21f47cf8e6f5).

So I decided to create my own. After months of testing I came up with a design that I'm very satisfied with and would like to share it with you.

* 4mm thick stainless steel (seed backup) + 2mm thick cover
* nickel binding posts, no loose parts
* 3mm A-Z letter stamp set made from hardened steel included
* capable of storing 24 recovery words + a passphrase, up to 8 characters per word
* compatible with Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, Jaxx, Exodus, Electrum and many more
* metal box
* It is called [Coldbit](https://coldbit.com/). It's made of thick stainless steel (AISI 304). Instead of assembling the seed letters are stamped onto the plates using the most reliable and bulletproof technique - a hammer and a letter stamp set. They will not scramble even if a heavy log from the roof of your house hits it during a house fire. The steel plates are then bound together using nickel binding posts.   


I believe this wallet will survive the most catastrophic events. I know that my seed words are safe inside it.  


I'm planning to launch an online shop in Q4 2018. The prices will be competitive. Initially we'll ship only to EU countries and in Q1 2019 to the rest of the world. Look out for an announcement, I'll include a discount code when we launch.  


Stay tuned.",1537558905,21/09/2018 19:41:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9htcqu/coldbit_new_stainless_steel_seed_backup_design/,1

Question about LN principles of operation,"I have some questions about LN and how its intended to work in the future:
- how ofter will you update your funds onchain? Weekly, daily, monthly?
- if theres X channels with - suppose it went mainstream- 1 million users that exchange btcs, and eventually all of them will close channels to update funds onchain. There will be 1mill -1 transactions onchain right? (Each one's address changes a little bit). But those 1mill onchain transactions has to be processed by regular chain limitations.
I'm sure that when btc get mainstream and gain adoptions maybe this will be solved, but this means that nowadays, even with LN, with fast and cheap transactions, it cant handle much users?
Is this aproach correct??

I just want to say how happy it makes me that people on both sides are doing responsible disclosure of critical vulnerabilities. This works out better for EVERYONE.,"Both sides of the camp very vehemently disagree with each other and say incredibly unkind things to each other and treat each other very poorly, but I can't even express how happy it makes me that at the end of the day people realize that it is in everyone's best interest to look out for one another. Cory Fields pointed out in his write up that no matter what he thinks about bitcoin cash it is in his and the project he has an affinity for's best interest to responsibly disclose bugs to them because in the future it may turn out to be the case that someone on the other side will have information about a critical vulnerability that he would like to have responsibly disclosed as well. Fast forward to today and here we are. A critical vulnerability was found in bitcoin core and it was indeed responsibly disclosed to them and not kept hidden or sold or exploited.

I don't think I can even express how important this is for both bitcoin cash and bitcoin core. I really hope this continues into the future or we are going to be headed in the direction of an inevitable disaster.

Thank you so much to both cory fields and awemany for setting such a precident on both sides. I hope this continues to be the case into the future.",1537577988,22/09/2018 00:59:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hvqmv/i_just_want_to_say_how_happy_it_makes_me_that/,1

Relation between @Omni_Layer / @Tether_to and CVE-2018-17144?,"According [full disclosure](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/) on September 17:

* 21:57 Bitcoin Core PR 14247 published with patch and test demonstrating the Denial of Service bug
* 21:58 Bitcoin ABC publishes their patch
* 22:07 Advisory email with link to Bitcoin Core PR and patch goes out to Optech members, among others

At the same day (September 17th) at 22:31 UTC we had last confirmed tether transaction and  then 8h downtime. According @Omni\_Layer, cause of this is issue with a backend client used by parsing engine that appears to have locked up/become non responsive. Omni core nodes were unaffected.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, @Tether\_to doesn't even run their own omni core node, they use @Omni\_Layer's OmniExplorer public api (great choice for multi-billion money printing press).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it took them 8h to reverify/resync blockchain and restart all processes. According [@dexx7y](https://twitter.com/dexx7y/status/1042305249808195586) omni core is unaffected by CVE-2018-17144. There's no full disclosure about incident, but they did release an [announcement](https://blog.omni.foundation/2018/09/20/state-of-the-layer-sep-20-2018/). It seams that ""backend process"" was terminated duo ""memory violation"".

&amp;#x200B;

Also, [@dexx7y](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9049#discussion_r218679843) asked bitcoin devs, day after incident, about bug. It might be just ""conspiracy theory"", but I'm really curious is there any connection between CVE-2018-17144 and  @Tether\_to downtime. Especially because it happened an hour after PR publish (with test demonstrating DoS attack). Keep in mind   that at that time bug  was  perceived as DoS attack and none talked about double spend possibility).

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that we will never know the truth, @Tether\_to guys are too secretive and beyond that too busy by 24x7 money printing ;) Timeline match of both issues might be just a coincidence, maybe those are related,  even further maybe   there was a double spend attack with tether and thats why they needed to reverify all blocks... What others think?

low throughput syncing a new node,"Trying to figure out why my node is so slow to download the blockchain.

My setup is as follows. I have two bitcoin core nodes running:

1. On macbook - 0.16.3, fully synced.
2. On raspberry pi 3 - 0.16.3, running with -connect=[ip of macbook]

Both running on the same local network.

Now, what I would expect to see, is the raspberry pi downloading blocks as fast as it can from the mbp fully synced node, but that's not what's happening. The download rate in the raspi is similar to that of normal DL from the public network. 

Additionally, the raspi's cpu isn't seem to be doing much. Only one core is busy at 28%.

My question is then - what's the bottleneck? If it's not network IO or CPU, what's throttling the DL speed of one node connecting to another in a local network?",1537592393,22/09/2018 04:59:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hx732/low_throughput_syncing_a_new_node/,1

Looking for the best BTC service that I can by coins with debit or credit,"I noticed the dream market sub is gone. I've had  a lot of luck using them in the past.

My problem is this.  I've heard that some BTC wallet services won't let you send your money to dream for some reason. I don't know if this is true or just gossip.

I'm not a huge purchaser. Just like to buy xans or RC.  Just a once in awhile thing.

I'm hoping you guys have some advice on what the best places I can use to buy btcs that will allow me to sem0nd the contents of my wallet to drea!m.  I've heard some services had decided not to allow the transactions to go through to dream or the other sites.  Again, rumor maybe, I don't know.

If anyone can help me with some advice on what services are best to use I'd really appreciate you guys letting me the current insurance and outs on what the best way to do this.

I'm approaching my birthday and I'd like to party a little.

Last thing.  I really need to find a wallet/service that will let me by BTC with credit cards or debit cards. I don't live close to one of those ATM machines that allow you to buy btcs on the street.
I've heard rumors yppou can do it at Western Union or places like that, so I was wondering if that was true or if that was something you would even recommend.

Any help or advice you can give me on this would be would really help me out.

Thanks guys.  Hoping you might be able to help me out.

And if I've skipped something or you know something important that could help me or keep me from getting screwed it would really help me out.

You guys are my lifesaver.

Hoping for some good news. Have a nice weekend.  Looking to spend about 10p bucks if that helps to let you know what I'm looking for.  I'd hook you up with my sister for helping me, but she is a softball playing lesbian that is a double bagger. But hey, you never know.

Stay safe, have a good weekend Reddit.

100% Bitcoin tech magazine with no price speculation - contributions welcome,"Hi All, 

I have worked restlessly for months to put together http://bitcointechweekly.com, a tech magazine exclusively focused on Bitcoin. It is mainly dedicated to new developers and technical people and does not include any price speculation or ads and offers an RSS feed. 

I started diving into bitcoin technology last year and I missed having a news source that would give me in glimpse all updates on Bitcoin related technology without having to scroll through tons of click bait content and price speculation. Before starting this project there was no such source of news as the vast majority of good quality tech articles were posted on personal blogs, while the most popular crypto blogs and magazines include price talk, ICOs and such with tons of ads. 

I thought it was relevant to share here and would appreciate any feedback. 

We also have a [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/!CbOXWmBuZVDBBmPKdT:matrix.bitcointechweekly.comarchives) where you can leave your feedback or contributions. ",1537611383,22/09/2018 10:16:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9hynvy/100_bitcoin_tech_magazine_with_no_price/,1

Bitcoin is a necessary evil,"Recently I was admitted to a psych ward. This makes my opinions invalid. Regardless of my mental breakdown. The overall experience led me to believe in some pretty powerful things. Did I want to have a mental breakdown? No. Did I want to spend 3 days in a psych ward? No the food sucks. Did I come out a better person because of it? Yes. 

Bitcoin is a lot like me. It changes its mind a fuck ton. Does not give a shit what people think about it. And it just keeps getting fatter and fatter because the people won't stop feeding it. I'm not going to say I was in the psych ward because of Bitcoin. I'll say it played a role in my deteriorating psych though. Because now I understand more then ever. Bitcoin will do a lot of good. But it will also bring out the worst in people. It already has. 

Bitcoin is a revolution. A very big and scary one. Will it better the world? That's up for debate atm. Will it fix all of life's problems? Heck no. That's up to the people to decide. Please people just try to be a little nicer everyday. We can change the world one soul at a time. 

Hodl on tight Bitcoin because we're in for a wild, bumpy, loopty loop, corkscrew, fucking melt your face off ride. So buckle up chuck. ",1537626988,22/09/2018 14:36:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9i04gj/bitcoin_is_a_necessary_evil/,1

A thought about dormant coins on the BTC blockchain,"As private keys are lost and coins get stuck over time, the btc chain will always have those coins visible but showing no movement. Yet there can only be suspicion but no guarantee that those coins aren't just in cold storage and ready to be moved when the owner chooses to. How will such a situation be reacted to by the market when assigning a value to bitcoin, especially once proportion of dormant coins on the chain becomes substantial? Wouldn't the transparent ledger make the BTC market inherently unstable due to this visible but not entirely reliable information about unmoved coins?",1537631148,22/09/2018 15:45:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9i0msa/a_thought_about_dormant_coins_on_the_btc/,1

Thoughts on BTC community's political compass. Let me know what you think.,"I'm sure most of us have seen this: [https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2](https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2)

Based on my experience talking to crypto enthusiasts, people understandably lean more libertarian as opposed to authoritarian. However, what interests me is that there seems to be a left and right divide among crypto people in terms of their economic outlook.

The people who lean towards libertarian right (purple region) have a more free-for-all outlook on economy. They think the government should interfere as little as possible so everyone can enjoy the opportunity to maximise wealth.

The people who lean towards libertarian left (green region) have a more egalitarian outlook on economy. They think the government should interfere as little as possible so everyone can distribute the wealth equally.

Subtle difference — but they manifest differently.

**Below are my observations. They aren't necessarily representative of wider reality so let me know if you have a different personal observation.**

Characteristics of libertarian right:

1. Drawn to crypto space to get rich.
2. Interested in which coins to buy and which coins to sell.
3. Likes to talk about their startup ideas and how much money they can make with it.
4. Strongly regrets that they didn't buy bitcoin years ago before it appreciated.
5. Sees crypto trading as a game with rules that can be mastered, and the goal is to ""win"" by maximising as much wealth as possible.
6. Sees wealth as a holy idea, as in, ""wealth should be good and desired, and those with great wealth ought to be admired and respected.""
7. Focuses more on breaking / challenging the existing system, and less on building / maintaining the new system that replaces it (extreme examples can be Roger Ver or Cody Wilson).
8. Probably aligns with Ayn Rand philosophically.
9. Predominantly male, for some reason.

Characteristics of libertarian left:

1. Drawn to crypto space due to frustration towards global financial inequality.
2. Interested in making financial services available to the oppressed or underprivileged.
3. Likes to talk about inequality as a concept, may even know their stuff very well, but not implementing solutions on the ground personally (example could be Andreas Antonopoulos).
4. Doesn't care much for HODL or trading crypto.
5. Sees crypto as solution to dysfunctional economies that make populations suffer (extreme examples can be Venezuela or Turkey).
6. Sees wealth monopoly as a detrimental legacy from previous financial system.
7. Focuses on building / maintaining a new system to replace the current one. May even work with current system to change itself.
8. Probably aligns with Bernie Sanders philosophically.

We probably have characteristics from both categories and that's okay. I think both have their merits and neither extremes are good. 

I personally lean more towards libertarian left ([https://imgur.com/a/jWjggPa](https://imgur.com/a/jWjggPa)), which might explain why it sometimes feel familiar but also alienating when talking to libertarian right at BTC meetups.

**Questions:**

1. What is your position on the political compass? (You can take test here: [https://www.politicalcompass.org/test](https://www.politicalcompass.org/test))
2. Do you find these descriptions accurate based on your experience?
3. Is your local crypto space more libertarian left or right?",1537633559,22/09/2018 16:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9i0xrp/thoughts_on_btc_communitys_political_compass_let/,1

Is lightning network the worst thing ever?,"So I hear people saying how LN is great etc and ""elcair works rn bro!"". I dont really understand all the complicated videos about it, and I tend learn better kinesthetically so out of interest I download elcair wallet to my phone, and send $1.50 to the wallet, (as I am told it is for small transactions). I dont have any nodes to connect to and ""random node"" didnt work.. so i selected ""ACINQ NODE"" which I presume is just a big node used by loads of people and im met with a message saying I have to send ""1000 bits minimum"".. thats like $5000 in a couple years time and I dont even think I can withdraw funds from this eclair thing. Theres no send option and no private key. Its also a ""3..."" address which means its some complicated multisig thing I dont understand.

I'm going to be honest, I cant be bothered to learn to become a programmer or computer wiz kid, I just want to be a ley man.

Section of Skynet’s Whitepaper was Leaked - Full Brain Emulation and Photonic Hardware - People talk about Quantum Proof but Are Blockchains Ready for Light-Based Hardware?,"Leaked Research: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iBc9RJyuJm6cTt7XlIZM7sYXA4j7Frcm/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iBc9RJyuJm6cTt7XlIZM7sYXA4j7Frcm/view)

One of the possible research areas and implementations of Skynet is a single-node photonic RC design with the Inception core. This would enable the Skynet Core to use **minimal power while processing millions of times faster than conventional hardware**. While the field of photonics, quantum computing, and reservoir computing are ways away, we remain cognizant of the benefits they can bring to the Skynet Core. One of the major problems in today’s computer science is the development of new hardware that could accelerate machine learning techniques. That hardware should be inherently fast, energy-efficient, and address information exchange bottlenecks present in now ubiquitous Von Neumann architecture. Reservoir computing (RC) is a novel brain-inspired computation paradigm that addresses those questions. One of the key benefits of RC is the support of information processing directly on the very level of hardware. First, we will introduce the general, hardware-independent idea of RC. Then, we will focus specifically on the so-called single-node photonic RC, which promises additional benefit of high-speed information processing and a solution to the high-degree network connectivity problem, based on complex nonlinear delay dynamics.

BIP44 - change level internal - meaning and usage,"I just read the BIP44 paper, which describes HD Wallets. These hierarchical wallets have levels, eg. m/44/3/0/1/7 means dogecoin, account 0, change level 1 (internal), address 7. The change level can only be 1 (internal) or 0 (external).

I have been told that External is meant to be used outside the wallet, e.g. if I want someone to send me coins, I give them an external address, internal is for change back to the wallet. This all makes sense in an abstract way, but what does it exactly mean? Why not just use an external address for the change?

I guess I don't really get what ""internal"" is... Is it

A) just a convention that wallet software can use to ""keep things tidy""?

B) Is it something a particular crypto network/protocol can implement, and if so, which ones do, and how does their treatment of these addresses differ.

C) Or is there some kind of cryptographic/mathematic property backed into these addresses that I don't know about?

As these addresses look the same to me as regular ones, and afaik their derivation is the same as external ones, I'm thinking the answer is A...?

So much manipulation the whole 2018 (mostly FUDs with no arguments or simply fake news),"It's insane when you think how many fake accounts were on reddit in 2018 in r/Bitcoin, FUDing every aspect of crypto.

How can you tell ? It's very easy to check, especially during these times: Back in the good old days of FUD, when the whales and banksters used to short BTC you would see both posts and top comments (most probably voted by army of bots ) FUDing about absolutely everything (mosty fake arguments) from BTC being the tulip mania of 2017-2018 to ver's ""BTC killing babies""

Now you can see the things have shifted as even with a major bug like one that was discovered few days ago, the paid bankster shills haven't appeared and the price haven't tanked, despite the bug being real this time.

Actually, not only that, but being in crypto for years, I know the regular convos ( mostly about tech, nice ideas etc ) and I can tell every time when there are real users talking normal crypto stuff and when the FUDsters appear. It becomes so clear after spending a few years around here.

Why do you think the FUDsters aren't posting as actively as they used to ? Even in the threads about BCH you can see the tone has shifted, the ""arguments"" are nowhere as severe as they used to be. 
- Do you think the banksters have finally stopped shorting BTC and now it's only the dump money doing it ?
- Do you think the banksters are still around, but they simply don't pay the shills anymore, thus the shills moved away ?
- Do you think they just took a break but will be back in town soon ?

I can clearly tell they took a break, it's just I'm not sure why...",1537659938,22/09/2018 23:45:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9i467a/so_much_manipulation_the_whole_2018_mostly_fuds/,1

Community trading platform idea....,"I have a cryptocurrency trading platform. It is a long story how I got here, but for more than 20 years I have been participating in the financial markets as a professional trader.

Before I started trading cryptocurrencies. I was what as known as a HFT trader in commodities and financial instruments.

As the volume and the volitility picked up in cryptocurrecies I had my platform developers adapt my HFT platform and now I just concentrate on trading cryptocurrecies. I love the 24 hour markets and the mad volitility. For me, these are the best trading times of my life. 

Recently, I have spoken with a few different people who tell me that it is hard to find a reliable trading platform. That there are some platforms but those are really only institutional and that there is nothing for all the traders that make cryptocurrency a valid reality. 

So I am thinking about letting people use my platform. It has all the features that a professional trader needs (robust, customisable algorithms and features, account management, alerts, connected to 40+ exchanges, can trade a huge amount of different coins). 

So I was wondering, in this reddit, what do people use to trade the coins. And if any of the community has an opinion on my idea to make the trading platform into a community platform for anyone to use? My idea here is to launch an website for the community with a forum and an video based educational area that that people can learn all the professional methods of trading through quick videos. Where traders can exchange comments and ideas with other traders and learn to gain advantage in the markets. In essence, creating a meritocratic society of coin traders. 

Any opinions welcomed

Barclays UK blocked account... I'm broke!,"So I purchased a few bitcoins and started to experiment with block chain out of curiosity. I've made a number of transactions in the past with no problems. I recieved a chargeback on a small amount from coinbase which ultimately disabled my coinbase account. 

So while sorting things out with coinbase I decided to try a different exchange, crypto. Managed to purchase some bitcoin which was successful but the day later I was blocked from using online banking, i ring the bank and confirmed everything they needed too be told I had to visit local branch to confirm who I am. 

The lady at the bank had no idea what was going on but was given a number to ring with no name. She explained my situation and was told they cannot give any information and that my account is completely blocked for investigation.

I now have to wait 10 days until I find out what is happening with my account. I can't access my money at all, use my card for any direct debits or even receive money. They where fully aware of my transaction as I ring on the day to ask why my card got declined on first attempt, they asked some security questions and then told me too try again. 

I can't see what the problem is, the branch have no idea. Fraud team have no idea.. what is going on? Has anyone else had this issue? I'm in panic mode over this as I got a house to run and can't access my money.

"Bitcoin Miners, Please test this pool out!","I run a small farm. I spoke to a developer at this company, extremely smart guys with technical backgrounds. They are going to blow up soon in my opinion. They have their own mining algo which increases mining efficiency. It's very easy to test, no registration and completely anonymous. Directions are bit confusing at first but shouldn't be hard to connect if you are an experienced miner. Please share your results so I can see what other people are experiencing. Thanks Guys/Gals!

Cash rules everything around me...,"Rehashing this discussion because I think it’s important. If an economic downtown which is certainly due within the next 6 years if not next year, what will happen to the price of Bitcoin? The answer is well explained in this past reddit. If stocks take a significant hit like they did in 2007-2008, then Bitcoin and cryptocurrency will follow because cash still rules everything around me. This isn’t pessimism but reality. All the most avid believers of stocks and Bitcoin quickly CASH out when they see turmoil. That’s human nature. But, I would love to see if anyone has theories that could disprove this notion.

A lot of poker sites are offering free withdrawals when using bitcoin instead of charging a fee so I've been trying to get used to using bitcoin but every time I try it creates atleast a 2 hour headache of me trying t figure things out.

The problem today was I signed up for coinbase and deposited $300 by linking by bank account, not debit card, so I could then send that money to my poker account. And guess what?

Coinbase said I can't send the money for a WHOLE MONTH.

Watch the film Big Short...I am more than convinced the world needs Bitcoins,"I just watched The Big Short, its about multiple group of people who saw the 2008 economy collapse and shorted their positions. After watching I am more than convinced that big financial instituions do not care about us. They neither cared about the people who shorted, and only 1 went to jail. Immigrants were blamed for the financial crisis. I can understand what led Satoshi to create Bitcoin.

We need bitcoins. period. We need a way to store our money in a decentralized value, without worrying whether it will fall or no. I think Bitcoin ETFs will be a bad idea. Traditional bankers will get into the ecosystem, and f\*\*\* it up. They always have, and always will do.

"Bitcoin ""is more typical of a precious metal"" - Satoshi Nakamoto","From Satoshi's response in this [thread](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source)

""It is a global distributed database, with additions to the database by consent of the majority, based on a set of rules they follow:

- Whenever someone finds proof-of-work to generate a block, they get some new coins
- The proof-of-work difficulty is adjusted every two weeks to target an average of 6 blocks per hour (for the whole network)
- The coins given per block is cut in half every 4 years

You could say coins are issued by the majority. They are issued in a limited, predetermined amount.

As an example, if there are 1000 nodes, and 6 get coins each hour, it would likely take a week before you get anything.

To Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.

**In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal**. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.""

Stellar Lumens 🚀🚀🚀,"Stellar Lumens (XLM) is about to go on an amazing ride. Do not miss out on the top performer of 2018. 

XRP (ripple) does not launch ICO’s (this is huge)
We (XLM holders) will be getting volume and adoption from every area of crypto all combined into one highly scalable and efficient blockchain (the stellar network; native asset, the Lumen)


Concrete reasons why XLM will vastly outperform XRP:

Stellar (XLM) pays partners to join the network, Ripple (XRP) is trying to sell XRP to banks and institutions. Why would any bank pay to use XRP when they could use XLM for free and be paid to do so? They wouldn’t that’s why Ripples partnerships are mainly in the PoC phase (western union partnership announcement).

Stellar’s native currency, XLM is built into the ecosystem and must be used as the bridge currency in all transfers (ensuring XLM continues to have volume while the network is used, new SWIFT banking system) XRP was not designed this way and is a critical flaw. At any time, Ripple can chose to create additional bank specific coins to be used on the network for transfer. Banks could pay to use this new coin ( real bad news for XRP investors) or pay to use XRP, but they will choose XLM for free.

XLM was given the green light by New York’s Department of Financial Services. This is a huge advantage because it will allow USA compliant exchanges to list Stellar Lumens, and this is already in the works (Coinbase, Gemini soon to follow) XRP was not given this clearance even though they have been asking for this distinction for a long time.

Biggest reason: Jed McCaleb, co founder and main technological resource left XRP to design XLM. He’s the Steve Jobs of cryptocurrency, but is actually a really nice guy. He also is the main innovator in this space. Regarded imho as the best cryptographer in the world with an ultra elite background in DLT technology. He set aside the lions share of lumens to be given away for charity and adoption. Ripple XRP is keeping their currency for themselves. That’s normal, but not as affective. XLM will soon lead the cryptocurrency market.

If you think bitcoin can’t be overthrown think again. AOL and MySpace have been replaced by Google and Facebook. Stellar Lumens (XLM) will soon be replacing Bitcoin. ",1537703858,23/09/2018 11:57:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9i7usp/stellar_lumens/,1

"Three fundamental asset classes: physical commodity, centralised ledger, and distributed ledger","All assets can be classified into one of these three.

Physical assets are things like physical gold that you can hold on your hand. The value of physical commodity is that you hold it because it is in your hand. The problem is that it is hard to store larger quantities and it is hard to hide, transport and transact with physical commodities. It is easy for thrives to steal gold if you keep it on you, and if you hide it somewhere eg bury it, then you might forget where you bury it.

Centralised ledger describes most fist assets such as USD, stocks, bonds, and property. Your ownership is determined by your name kept by some organisation. If you have USD in a bank account then the bank maintains the ledger. Property and shares are held by some registrar. The problem with this system is identity theft and the need to trust the entity maintaining the register. You have no idea if they are doing something to your asset behind your back.

Distributed ledger is where your ownership of the asset is maintained on a register but that register or ledger is not controlled by one entity but by multiple entities verifying it. This is where bitcoin and many other cryptos come in. The advantage of this is security and transparency. You can see where your asset is and how it is being used. It is public and open source. The downside is that many entities verifying the ledger makes it slower.

All three of these have their pros and cons. However, the benefits of distributed ledger technology is not understood by many which is why crypto today is highly undervalued.

"Is there any ""automated"" way of testing passwords for a 24+1 word seed?","Last December, in the middle of the *20k bull run*, I decided to split the few bitcoins I had into two different wallets; I sent a small fraction to a hot wallet I created, and put the rest into a cold wallet for the future (as savings). I used a 24 word + passphrase approach (BIP39?) for the second wallet; and as you may have guessed, I don't remember the password. When I tried to access it only a few days later, I couldn't. Well, I could, but balance was zero, which means that I had forgotten the password I had used. And no, coins have not been moved, I keep the public address and they're still there. It's just that I can't access them because I'm trying the wrong password, which creates a totally different wallet. At first I panicked, but since 2018 started with a huge drop in value, I just gave up trying to access my lost funds (honestly, entering a bear market made me feel a bit better hehe)... 

Anyway, I was just wondering if there is an automated way of trying a bunch of possible passwords faster than doing it manually. At this point, I've assumed I've lost those coins... But just in case.  


**Note**: no, I'm not trying to hack anybody else's wallet. I just want to know if there is any known script or way of testing a huge list of possible passwords to regain access to a lost wallet.  


Thanks in advance!",1537714123,23/09/2018 14:48:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9i8w0f/is_there_any_automated_way_of_testing_passwords/,1
"Venezuelan update: One BTC is around 700,000 BsS. (Bolivares), monthly minimum wage is around 19 USD -0.003 BTC- and inflation keeps going on (even in USD). 72 BTC were traded in the last 24h using Localbitcoin.","Hello,

You can check the ""Coffee with milk index made by Bloomberg"" https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-venezuela-cafe-con-leche-index/ 

Government ""set"" the prices of some goods and what happens is that they set the price is under the production cost. 

One example is meat, there is not meat anywhere, price is set at 90 BsS. per kilo (which is around 90 usd cents)  none wants to sell at that price.

Another problem (which I ""think"" could help to ""fix"" economy) is that some prices (in USD) are the same of more expensive than the international price. For example one soda can (Coke) is around 1 USD. One Mcflurry ice cream is 4-5 USD and so on. (I use these examples, so you can compare easily). But remember minimum wage is 19 USD per MONTH. So it's really had for people to live here, even if you have family abroad and they used to send 50$ per month and people used that to live here now more USD are needed....

The only problem of this TB is when trading with stellar/lumen; when I start the auto trade and I earn about 0.01 BTC, the autotrade stop and it return at the initial settings. I've got this problem only on this coin and I don't understand why .. 


Someone can help me please ??

I lost everything I had on Cryptsy and I never recovered again.,"At that time I was a much younger kid, 18 years old and I was starting to know the crypto world, after a few good transactions I managed to win 7 bitcoins.

&amp;#x200B;

I believed and trusted the crypto community and I was sure that I was going to change the world as we knew it until now, what I didn't expect is that they would take everything from me overnight.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I remember that it was a hot morning, I went into my account and found it empty and also my coins had been withdrawn. I never felt so bad in my life and so desperate as that day. I felt quite lonely and misunderstood because I am not American so I do not know the language well, so I never fought for my coins and I did not follow any legal process to recover them, I have never again managed to have so many bitcoins as that time, nor near.

&amp;#x200B;

After a short time I could not access my account and as I do not have any photographic evidence I can never prove what I had there.

&amp;#x200B;

After so much time today has come back to my mind and now I wonder, any of you have managed to recover what you had there? If so, how? I've been reading that there was a kind of trial and the owner was convicted but I don't know if anyone has recovered exactly their coins.

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote this after so long because I needed to vent, I didn't want to drag it around much longer. Today bitcoin is $6700 and I'm still poor. Yay!",1537721782,23/09/2018 16:56:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9i9vip/i_lost_everything_i_had_on_cryptsy_and_i_never/,1

Bitcoin From A Teenager’s Standpoint,"I’m currently a senior in high school, have been in the cryptocurrency community since freshmen year. Also apart of a university’s Blockchain program. 

I started Bitcoin when PayPal closed my account because I was a minor. I was always interested in entrepreneurship and without a bank, I thought I would be severely limited. I got mad at the power PayPal had over my money. When exploring ways to control my money, I found Bitcoin with the help of a prominent figure in the field. 

In the last year, I have had classmates ask me about Bitcoin at least once a week. Many are beginners, others have empty Bitcoin wallets, and some even have some coins they’re interested in. But the overall theme is that they’re interested. I even had the chance to give Bitcoin to beginners and when they loved watching the dollar value change but the Bitcoin value being static. 

One of my classmates decided to put their summer work money into Bitcoin (I gave him a hardware wallet) when he didn’t trust his parents being a co-owner of his bank account and wanted full control of his money. And this adoption tells me something, that one day these classmates of mine will be willing to accept Bitcoin when they are apart of or own businesses. 

Bitcoin is more than just an investment, it’s liberty. It’s less power to centralization, more power to the people. Bitcoin allows you to be banked no matter your age, no matter how oppressed your country is, and no matter how much money you have. I have no doubt that Bitcoin will be here in five years, in 10 years, and I have no doubt I will one day be able to use Bitcoin to pay for my morning coffee.

"Warning about HitBTC - Disappearing funds when moving from ""Main"" to ""Trading"" Account","Reposting what I posted in the HitBTC reddit to hopefully save other users from getting screwed by HitBTC and having their funds stuck in limbo.

So it seems for those not aware that for some unclear reason HitBTC has a ""Main"" account and a ""Trading"" account. There is as far as I can tell no reasoning behind there being 2 accounts. The main difference is that the ""Main"" account can withdraw/deposit funds directly why the ""Trading"" account can only trade and cant deposit or withdraw. 

While I can see why this might seem like a good idea, there is no benefit to actually having 2 accounts. You can transfer funds from ""Main"" to ""Trading"" and vice versa without any restrictions so its really a useless step. 

Now this is the gotcha. When you try to do this magic transfer from one account to the other the funds will just magically disappear. As far as I can tell this has been a known issue, as soon as a googled the issue reports came up going back months with no real solution. 

I have already contact HitBTC and described the exact issue to which they provided me more or less a canned response that I should change browsers, clear my cookies, login/out etc.. Which of course I had already tried and didnt resolve the issue.

So to get to the point I  want to warn other users to avoid HitBTC until they resolve this issue so others dont get screwed by this. While I wont say they are scammers or stealing my funds as I might get them back eventually; But for now the funds are in Limbo with my account showing no funds in either account but clearly showing a Transfer into the ""Trading"" account.

Mine Bitcoin in the land of Ghengis Khan for only $70 per month.,"Hi guys

We are a new startup in Mongolia working to develop blockchain technology. 

We run a blockchain news and educational website in Mongolian, also provide introductory blockchain courses at local universities through one time events and workshops, and we operate a miner hosting facility. 

Our miner hosting facility is up and running.You will find our prices to be amongst the best in the market. 

www.monbit.mn/eng

We are also planning on entering blockchain development in the near future to take on Government services in rural communities (Voting, Registry, etc). Another development idea that we are currently entertaining is a blockchain registry for carbon offsets. 

Mongolia is a peaceful democracy with a rich history and two giant neighbors. The renewable energy potential of Mongolia is immense and the industry is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Also our ancestors killed a lot of people in the past, sorry : ( 

Our Government has been very open towards the adoption of blockchain based technologies. The ministry of finance is even in the process of releasing a government bond that will be registered on the blockchain. 

Cheers, 
Monbit Team

Why does mining difficulty increase?,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone explain a couple of things to me? I know that the mining difficulty increases when more miners join the network (more computational power) in order to keep the block time at an average of 10 minutes (600 seconds). I also know the difficulty is adjusted every two weeks and I know that the block time needs to stay the same in order for the whole blockchain to properly propagate to the latest transaction history.

&amp;#x200B;

However; what exactly defines the difficulty? When I'm looking at this chart, what exactly am I looking at?[https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty?timespan=2years](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty?timespan=2years)

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently at 7,152,633,351,906 what exactly? The amount of hashes it requires on average to solve 1 block? And why is this number constantly going up? Is that because more and more solutions are already found orr something? Why only 21million btc ever?

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to see this answered, thnx!",1537790385,24/09/2018 11:59:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ihazy/why_does_mining_difficulty_increase/,1

The bitcoin price recently climbed over the [$8,000 mark](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) for the first time since May 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. Many investors are now wondering if the tide has officially turned and the bull market is here to stay. Billionaire investor Marc Lasry [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/marc-lasry-bitcoin-to-hit-40000-dollars-as-it-becomes-more-mainstream.html) that the price of bitcoin could reach up to $40,000 as it becomes more accepted and easier to trade.

I believe that as regulatory uncertainty in the space continues to be resolved, mainstream adoption continues to increase, and the [CBOE application](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf) for a bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund ([ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)) is passed — which it very likely soon will be, in my opinion — that the price may well surpass $40,000 by the end of 2018 and could continue to climb as we enter 2019.  


What are your thoughts on this one guys?  
Especially the part with ETF?  


Do you think it's just the begining of Bitcoin to shine?

Douglas Adams - 1999 - How to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Internet,"[http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html](http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html)

Article written by Douglas Adams for the Sunday Times, published 29th Aug 1999 talking about the **new** technology ""**the** **internet**""  
I taught it's funny how many parallels you can draw between arguments then about the net and arguments now about bitcoin...  
so I figured I'll share it here...

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR

a few quotes from the article if you don't feel like reading:

&gt;...and I was authoritatively informed by a very distinguished journalist that the whole Internet thing was just a silly fad like ham radio in the fifties, and that if I thought any different I was really a bit naïve...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  ...a crime was planned by people ‘over the Internet'...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Another problem with the net is that it’s still ‘technology’, and ‘technology’,    as the computer scientist Bran Ferren memorably defined it, is ‘stuff that doesn’t    work yet.’...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?  
doesn't the article perfectly apply today for crypto...

HELP OUR BUSINESS MEDIATION TEAM TO GO TO SÃO PAULO NATIONAL COMPETITION," The FADERGS TEAM of competitors consists of students members of the Department of Mediation and Conflict Solutions School of Alternative Legal Training University Center FADERGS.  
[https://www.gofundme.com/businessmediation](https://www.gofundme.com/businessmediation)

Appropriate methods of conflict resolution are part of the academic training of all members of the group. Mediation is a consensual method of conflict resolution that has been used in various areas of law and is focused on providing solutions to meet the interests of those involved in a conflict and the possibility of maintaining relationships through communication.  


The team is committed to the opportunity to enhance the skills that have been worked out throughout the training for the competition and with the experience of being able to participate in this important national event.  


The competition takes place from the provision of a practical case for teams to study it, produce mediation plans (written procedure) and perform mediation simulations during the period of the competition (oral), in which students represent mediators mediandos and lawyers such as in a mediation session.  


The FADERGS University Center was one of the 24 institutions selected in the pre-registration of the Competition. We have already completed our registration and have already submitted our mediation plans (written phase). In order for our trip to São Paulo to take place from October 25 to October 28, we need financial support to cover the cost of boarding and lodging for the 7 students who are members of the team.

A equipe de competidores da FADERGS é composta por alunos membros do Departamento de Mediação e Soluções Alternativas de Conflitos da Escola de Formação Jurídica do Centro Universitário FADERGS.  


Os métodos adequados de resolução de conflitos fazem parte da formação acadêmica de todos os membros do grupo. A mediação é um método consensual de resolução de conflitos que vem sendo utilizada em várias áreas do Direito e está voltada para soluções que proporcionem a satisfação dos interesses dos envolvidos em um conflito e da possibilidade de manutenção das relações por meio da comunicação.  


A equipe está comprometida com a oportunidade aprimorar as habilidades que vêm sendo trabalhadas ao longo do treinamento para a competição e com a experiência de poder participar desse importante evento de âmbito nacional.  


A Competição acontece a partir da disponibilização de um caso prático para que as equipes o estudem, produzam planos de mediação (fase escrita) e realizem simulações de mediação durante o período da Competição (fase oral), em que os alunos representarão os mediadores, mediandos e advogados como em uma sessão de mediação.  


O Centro Universitário FADERGS foi uma das 24 instituições selecionadas na pré-inscrição da Competição. Nós já realizamos nossa inscrição e já submetemos nossos planos de mediação (fase escrita). Para que a nossa ida para São Paulo aconteça, no dia 25 ao dia 28 de outubro, precisamos de um apoio financeiro para arcar com os custos de passagem e hospedagem para os 7 alunos membros da equipe.

The B Foundation. What some of us don't like about it / why we fight.,"You might have noticed there is a flamewar going on on Twitter about ""The B"", aka Bitcoin Foundation 2.0 aka ""we are not a Bitcoin Foundation!"".

I would like to clarify some of the criticism we are giving:

&amp;#x200B;

**1- The name.**

The B Foundation, especially with the Bitcoin logo as the ""B"", was definitely of bad taste. Even if it was a joke or trolling, there was no way it would have been accepted. This is not the main criticism, but an obvious one.

&amp;#x200B;

**2- The people.**

Basically, The B lists the best people on crypto-twitter today, but more importantly very heavy-weight in the industry itself. Adam Back, Slush, Giacomo, Starkness, Jameson Lopp, .... an amazing and very respected group of individuals. **None of the criticism is against the individuals**, but against the group itself. Why is there a need for such an ""authority"" (as in respect, not as in control)? Does The B need to place itself as THE foundation? This would be the major criticism, media and newcomers will see this group as the representative of Bitcoin. Or at the very least as the representative of the ecosystem and industry. But people change, interest and alignment of ideology change too. Remember Gavin? Remember Bitpay? even Roger Ver. These were the face of Bitcoin at some point. Why would we create an even bigger figure? Another remainder would be The Bitcoin Foundation, set up with good intentions and with public figures too, and ended up being a scam. Did you know they still receive donations from major companies that believe they are funding Bitcoin development?

&amp;#x200B;

**3- ""Marketing and PR"".**

This is a very contentious point, and comes back to what is Bitcoin. Should we make it mainstream (that seems to be the goal of The B) now? If this is the case, The B and the community will again be under pressure for scaling, speed, costs... and all of those will come at a cost in censorship resistance if we rush it. Now imagine this Marketing and Public Relations entity also is responsible of funding the developers... what could go wrong? oh wait, that's what The B is about.

&amp;#x200B;

**4- Do we need it?**

Many organizations are funding developers, and we should all participate. Blockstream, BHB, Lightning Labs, Trezor... all support developers. The stated goal of The B is to facilitate the administrative burden to fund devs. It totally makes sense, any central entity will be more efficient than a decentralized counterpart. The problem will be to get rid of it when the time comes, so far we haven't been able to get rid of the previous ones.

&amp;#x200B;

**What do people arguing want then?**

Well first of all there should not be a politically strong entity representing (though marketing or whatever) ""Bitcoin"". It's perfectly fine and encouraged to create alliances and teams, but these should not create a legacy that can become a threat (like Bitcoin(dot)com, the Bitcoin Foundation, etc). A great execution of this is Bitcoin Core: it's not a legal entity, is always changing and is kept sane by being under attack and scrutiny all the time. Other examples would be the No2X movement, UASF, and others that gathered people for when it was needed, but didn't end up with becoming any ""authority"" in the space, only an idea/ideology.

A list of ALL THINGS to respect would be:

\- Don't call yourself or behave anything like a (shitcoin) foundation. Slush pointed out that it's necessary in the legal name, great, but not in the material as far as I know. If we wanted a funding and marketing foundation, we would be on Ethereum.

\- Don't promote The B as a group of all the top people. This would have the same effect as being perceived as a Bitcoin Foundation, as a de-facto authority.

\- Don't centralize the public relations AND funding, under any circumstances. The pressure would be unbearable for the entity.

\- DO offer solutions for grants, education, research, but maybe as separate entities each.

\- Have a board, but not of ""the whole industry"", especially if we don't know how they are chosen/""elected"". And even more if you don't need it. (Why do you need all these people in such an organization anyways, if the goal is not governance of Bitcoin???)

&amp;#x200B;

The risk is not what The B would be today, but what it could become tomorrow. Is the reward worth the risk? I really don't think so. Rushing for solution might come back an hunt us for a very long time, so let's argument and find a better solution.",1537822268,24/09/2018 20:51:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ilqc2/the_b_foundation_what_some_of_us_dont_like_about/,1

There’s such a misguided idea that Bitcoin is safe because it’s ‘decentralised’,"No, I’m not here to tell you Bitcoin is bad, I like Bitcoin, but I strongly dislike all the circle jerking in this community. 

The main reason is because 60% of the total supply is held by 0.1% of the total amount of wallets. 

Why is this bad? 

Because the community falsely believes that Bitcoin is the people’s currency, sorry to burst your bubble (pun intended), but that is not the case. 

With these whales having that much control over the supply, it can only be bad. 

You’re trusting the 0.1% to not fuck you over, should they choose to do so, they can dump their coins and completely fuck the market over. The price would literally plummet, not a 10%, not a 20%, it would be more like a 95% price decrease within a very very short amount of time.  

Having to trust the 0.1% is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what we were trying to achieve. 

It’s also the most ridiculous advice telling everyone to ‘hodl’ because for mass adoption, we need people using Bitcoin more than they use fiat. If everyone’s just holding on to their coins, then how the fuck do you think we are going to achieve mass adoption?

Bitcoin Investors and Speculators Maintained Their Positions Over Summer," 

Bitcoin (BTC) investors and speculators held their positions over the summer, while markets seem to have become more stable overall, according to a new study by Chainalysis published September 24.

The data presented in the report was compiled using the concept of standardized monetary aggregates. Specifically, the analysts categorized coins from the most liquid (coins used for speculation and transactions) to less liquid (coins held for investment), and the least liquid (lost coins, or coins yet to be mined), subsequently categorizing the money supply into monetary aggregates.

Per the study, the monetary aggregates were “extremely steady” during the summer, showing that the amount of BTC held for speculation was stable from May to August at around 22 percent of available BTC. The amount of BTC held for investment also showed stability during the same period at around 30 percent.

Chainalysis suggests that this is a sign the market has become less susceptible to hype, having built a tolerance to news flow, which according to the report, is no longer able to push BTC prices up and down. “Instead, the market seems to have recalibrated after the entry of so many new market participants with different beliefs and expectations than those who held Bitcoin prior to 2017,” the study further reads.

Both long-term investors and speculators maintained their positions over the summer, reportedly meaning that only a fundamental change like restrictive regulation or technology improvements could cause a market reaction.

In addition to these findings, Chainalysis notes that BTC has maintained growth in its user base from the end of 2017, suggesting that the first challenge of adoption, which is getting crypto into people’s hands, is being overcome.

In June, Chainalysis published a study, which shows a switch from BTC “hodlers” to speculators in the six preceding months. Since December 2017, the amount of BTC held by day traders has reportedly risen to 5.1 million BTC, almost equaling the amount held by long-term investors — those who have held the coins for more than a year — which equals about 6 million BTC.",1537851992,25/09/2018 05:06:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ipcbe/bitcoin_investors_and_speculators_maintained/,1

Bitcoin's Amount In Active Wallets Near Record Highs,"According to new data from Chainalysis, an increasing amount of bitcoin is being held by active individual users, rather than companies and long-term investors.

As analysis says, the firm found 4.8 million bitcoin, or roughly 32 percent of the protocol's cryptocurrency supply (minus lost coins), was held in personal wallets with some level of transactional activity as of August 31. That's up substantially from the end of 2017 – around the time the market peaked – when just 3.8 million bitcoin, or 26 percent, was in the hands of individuals.

Philip Gradwell, the Chief Economist at Chainalysis about this: ""There's a much larger supply that's liquid. A lot of the people who bought [this year] are buying smaller amounts. They are ready – if things were to change, [if] the opportunity to spend it were to arise – to actually spend it. We've kind of overcome the first hurdle of adoption, getting bitcoin into people's hands.""

Is there any foreseeable possibility that the US changes their tax law?,"The way I see it is a lot of people made a lot of ""digital, magical internet money"" in '17, they sold their gains in early/mid '18, they bought lots of dips on the way down, and now they are sitting on significantly reduced positions, yet... they still have serious capital gains to pay. Some may even be underwater where their current positions wouldn't even cover the taxes they owe.

So the only realistic scenarios are to:
A) Sell all/most of their positions effectively exciting crypto entirely to pay the taxes.
B) Underreport, risking audit and penalties in the future.
C) Not report, risking the same as B above.

The current system is massively flawed and only encouragers people to B) or C). And the amount of time and resources necessary to ""track down"" Bs and Cs would most certainly not justify the taxes obtained as a result.

How/where do we get people to start lobbying for a simple tax law to pay only on digital &gt; fiat and vise versa?",1537857129,25/09/2018 06:32:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ipss9/is_there_any_foreseeable_possibility_that_the_us/,1

BTC as new world reserve currency - need some help with my thoughts,"If I imagine BTC as new world reserve currency what must be fullfilled ? In my opinion it is stabilization value (in relation to some real value of goods, lands, buildings etc.) of BTC. Without it I imagine to borrow BTC money (for mortgage to 30 years etc.) and if BTC exponencially growth as of last 10 years, it is impossible to return borrowed money with some interests. Until value of BTC will not be stable as rock through many years, there is no way to make it new reserve currency and also without debts there is much less economic activity and it is not good for economy and growth of GDP. Am I completely wrong or in what relation. Is it mistake to not account usd for the future as flexible money for everyday use (paying, borrowing..) with its inherited feature of depreciation in time ?

I've done some tests with RBF in regtest,"Hi, I've discussed a lot about RBF but never done my own tests to verify my assessments. Last week I was discussing again, convinced that actual RBF implementation only permits adding inputs to replace the transaction and someone did some tests proving you could change the destination address too. 

As I said, I have done my own tests using regression test mode. The test:

I used a 3 node environment. I used createrawtransaction for creating all the transactions in the test. First I created a  non-replaceable tx and propagate it, checked the transaction was in my 3 node mempool and create another using the same input and changing destination address and fee. I couldn't send this second transaction due to a mempool conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/99ceq2b2kco11.png

I did the same test with a replaceable transaction (RBF), create a transaction, send it and check it was in my 3 node mempool. Create another transaction using the same input but changing destination address and increasing the fee. After sending it I checked the first transaction was replaced with this new version.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been wrongly convinced you could only change the fee in RBF and I think there are a lot of people that thinks like I did.

IranbyBit: Bitcoin-Powered Tourism Fueling Iranian Economy,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wy3i6upwoco11.jpg

An Iranian travel startup is tackling the country’s economic sanctions and consequent financial exclusion by offering visitors to the country an opportunity to pay for their travel experience with Bitcoin.  


Speaking to Bitcoin News, IranbyBit‘s founder Setare Shabanipour discussed the importance of having the option to pay with Bitcoin, and how the business is helping to grow both the tourism sector in Iran and international levels of Bitcoin adoption.  
**Why does Iran need a Bitcoin travel option?**  
Iran has been subject to economic sanctions from the US, the European Union and the United Nation Security Council in various capacities since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Through the years, the sanctions have taken the forms of asset freezes and trade embargos, which have taken a serious toll on the country’s economy and people.  


It is difficult to send and receive money from other countries while based in Iran, creating a major issue for attracting outsiders to visit the country. Shabanipour explained that tourists are not able to use credit cards, Visa or Mastercard; ”Travelers need to exchange their money to the Iranian local currency and carry cash with themselves which is a troublesome and an unpleasant experience,” she said. It also makes it difficult for international travelers to book their accommodation and events such as local tours before they enter the country.

Bitcoin based webshop,"I truly wonder what you guys thinks about this project.
I'm about to launch a webshop where you can actually pay with bitcoin, and bitcoin exclusively.

The main argument against bitcoin is that it is only good for buying drugs on the darknet,
no acceptance from the retail world for it's questionably future and volatility, market manipulations, scams, you name it.

Say there is a brave idiot like who is willing to take a risk to adopt bitcoin as form of payment.
I've worked out a scheme that keeps the operation safe from bitcoin's volatile nature, all
automated. The reason behind the birth of the idea is the excessive taxation of small businesses in my shithol Yuropoor country. All legal details worked out, there is a legit company behind, conforming all
legal requirements. Again, it has to be bitcoin only, to avoid tax authorities seeing finances.

Now, here comes the problem from the customer's point of view.
Okay, I pay with my bitcoin, the transaction goes through but I feel unsafe as there is no payment processor between the merchant and myself, giving some sort of protection against a possible fraud.
What if I pay and the goods never arrive, I can not even get a chargeback and I'm screwed for good.

Would you ever buy anything from a bitcoin only webshop?
What would make you confident buying from such an outlet?",1537868867,25/09/2018 09:47:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9iqr7r/bitcoin_based_webshop/,1

Bitcoin and an experience to remember.,"I'm not going to type out the whole story but Bitcoin has taught me a lot of lessons. Recently, I had to move and change jobs. A while back I had bought an unwise amount of bitcoin compared to my income. It was fun and exciting to trade and see the numbers go up, to feel the adrenaline. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of all the lessons and hard truths, this morning I had to make this post. I'm down over a thousand dollars compared to what I put in across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. Looking at the graphs and how much money I could have made if I had sold at the perfect time, it's easy to beat myself up. Yea, what I did was stupid and I should have saved my money instead. Now, I'm slowly taking what I need and using it on Bitpay when I need something before paydays. This whole experience is more than money or cool technology, for me at least. I still have a some crypto... about half of what I did. But I'm not sad or depressed. There are so many possibilities that could have happened. I could have had even worse judgement and spent all that money on drugs or stupid shit in general. However, I got sober July 4th. I stopped drinking every night and blaming everything on my past, blaming my current shitty actions for past things that happened to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went through a lot this past year, but a thousand dollars to learn how little I really do know was worth every satoshi (at least keeping it positive). This has been a really humbling experience.. brutally, relentlessly humbling. I learned to save, to admit my mistakes, and how to learn from my failures, how to really learn from them. I'm just really grateful it happened now instead of later in life. If anyone else can relate to this, I hope you're keeping your head high and your outlook bright. I saw a post recently that described happiness as a butterfly. If you try to catch it, it will fly away. It's when you're not searching, but living that it will come near. CGP grey had a video that describes a similar thing but with a boat. I'm working on fixing my ""boat"" and learning new hobbies. Have a great day and I sincerely hope anyone reading this finds something to take away. Thank you.",1537871698,25/09/2018 10:34:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ir07d/bitcoin_and_an_experience_to_remember/,1

I quit my job to start an Accounting Crypto Tax Firm [ Australia ] Free Tax Source Wiki,"Hello /r/Bitcoin

I quit my job to start a Chartered Accountant, Registered Tax Agent Firm!

While i am in the early days and rather unoccupied, I've decided i will spend my spare time creating a free tax source Wiki for all crypto related questions &amp; answers. I want to try explain any difficult to understand, or overly technical tax terms in as simple English as possible.

I already have a handful of pages of notes, mostly covering tax treatments, but its not enough. I was hoping i could get some recommendations of what sort of content to focus on / what it is people are struggling with the most, or even any specific tax related questions that anyone wants answered. 

Any ideas are welcome, there are no stupid questions.

Bitcoin Core Wallet - Different Balances with Same Wallet,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a system that has a wallet on it using Bitcoin Core.

I created a passphrase and forgot it.

I have a backup of the same wallet with a known passphrase.

On a different computer, I installed the Bitcoin Core, copied my wallet.dat file over, and started the program.

It verified and did the blockchain update.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, the older system shows a balance of ##.66544 and the new shows a balance of ##.64190

It's not a big difference but a difference none the less.

&amp;#x200B;

Both Bitcoin Core blockchains are full updated.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Ghost of Mt. Gox Strikes Again,"Okay, I’m not totally sold on this old recycled narrative about the Mt. Gox trustee selling Bitcoin to compensate their defrauded customers...as the primary cause of Bitcoin’s recent fall. But, I do believe the ghost of Mt. Gox does have an impact, just not as much as Coindesk alludes to. Obviously, Mt. Gox is the posterchild of cryptocurrency fraud and the original deceptive Bitcoin Exchange. Mt. Gox is the reason I had no interest in Bitcoin back in 2013-2014 (which in hindsight I regret). The most disturbing part about this Mt. Gox problem child is that it not only transparently exists today but it has manifest itself in other forms (Bitforex, Bitfinex, Tether - I don’t trust any of those foreign/Asian exchanges particularly after Mt. Gox). Of course, if you have a large stakehold, it’s almost smart to have a hard wallet instead of relying on some distant exchange but most people don’t do that. It’s an inevitability that Bitfinex will collapse as soon as Tether is exposed for the sham that it is. The house of cards will fall like the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme - these things don’t survive the test of time. But it’s bothersome that everyone is convinced that Mt. Gox is a lone wolf or isolated incident when the same people who ran Mt. Gox to the ground don’t go away...they pop their ugly heads among other exchanges. The whales use Mt. Gox selling to their advantage. Everyone should be cautioned that Mt. Gox will happen again 4-5 years from today where Bitfinex is selling millions of Bitcoin. History repeats itself...

Iranian Bitcoin Volume as an indicator to Instability,"  

Iran’s bitcoin volume shadows both external and internal events in the daily lives of the Iranian regime. On December 4, 2017 the Trump Travel Ban came into effect, with, most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea being barred from entering the United States, along with some groups of people from Venezuela. During this week, the bitcoin volume coming from Iran spiked to a new high. This past week, we saw a similar spike in Iranian bitcoin volume after the Gunmen staged a deadly attack on a high-profile military parade in the southwest of [Iran](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Iran), killing at least 24 people and injuring at least 60. 

The origin of the money behind the bitcoin volume is the most interesting part of the equation. If the volume is coming from regime leaders, then this would indicated that they are nervous as to their grip on power. On the other hand, if the money is coming from Iranian citizens who have saved over time than we can assume that they also believe that more internal trouble is coming. What is the best way, to ensure your money is not confiscated and can be retrieved in the future? Put it in bitcoin where it cannot be confiscated by the government.

In either scenario we can determine that Iran is facing a tumultuous time ahead. Where will this leave Iran in the future? That is the million dollar question that we will have to follow in the weeks ahead.

This XRP post was taken down before it was seen in their subreddit.,"""Volume relative to Price: XRP 

\*First post in awhile so don't tear me down straight out the gates, please!\*

I have finally come to the conclusion that there are so many automated traders, that spikes in volume can drastically trigger price fluctuations.

These programs are meant to work against the fundamentals of trading.

They have been here for years and are not going anywhere.

The price spike of xrp is a great example, bringing it to around 75-80 cents.

Now that this volume is ""normal"" , the auto-traders will compensate.

No TA's can save us.

Otherwise, Ripple is a great company! Want to see more at swell.

How to begin a country-wide Bitcoin adoption?,"I have an ambitious goal of lobbying and launching a country-wide Bitcoin adoption. For that I need your thoughts and insights on building a roadmap for that. To depict a clearer picture, let me begin by telling you a short backstory.

I am from a small post-soviet country of Armenia with 3 million population. A couple of months ago, the party I am a member of led the [Armenian Velvet Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Armenian_Velvet_Revolution) and came to power in the country. After having been in extreme corruption and poverty for 25 years, we have finally planted the seeds of healthy economics and justice in the country. 

After solving the first priority issues in country, we are now starting to plan in a longer term. I am a firm Bitcoin believer and I cannot help but see how huge can be the benefits of Bitcoin adoption for a country with growing economy ($3600 GDP per capita right now). The new government of Armenia is extremely selfless, people-oriented and open for innovation. Therefore if me and other local crypto enthusiasts come up with well-grounded reasoning for Bitcoin adoption and a proper roadmap, the government is likely to embrace it. Good thing about Armenia is that being a small country, we can act like a startup - make quick decisions and iterate on results.

How is the current situation of Bitcoin in Armenia:
* We have no legislation regarding it, whatsoever
* There are 2 physical exchanges where you can buy and sell Bitcoin with 5% margin (clearly unauthorized and not taxed)
* A few former oligarchs have large mining facilities next to their hydropower plants. Some techies like me run small mining facilities.

So, basically nobody in Armenia cares about Bitcoin right now.

What opportunities we have:
* Our country is very sunny. Is there a practice of running mining facilities on electricity from solar plants? Is it effective?
* We have a strong tech community that will collaborate on new, ambitious tech projects. A few 'blockchain' associations and startups but none promoting Bitcoin.
* We have a government that came to power through decentralized protests, and which now likes listening to people and making decisions benefitting everyone.

What possible steps I have in mind for Bitcoin adoption:
* Giving a legal status to Bitcoin. Is this required? Which is the best status to give? A currency? An asset?
* Enabling crypto payments for businesses. For this we need an instant electronic crypto-to-fiat service, right? So that taxes are paid right after accepting a payment. Now, as I understand, this crypto-to-fiat service needs to run on a local BTC exchange in order to support the local fiat currency. Is my train of thought correct?

Based on the information provided, I would very much appreciate your thoughts and feedback on all of this. Am I thinking in the right or wrong direction? If you were the country leader, would you do it in the steps described above or in a totally different way?",1537910316,25/09/2018 21:18:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9iw7es/how_to_begin_a_countrywide_bitcoin_adoption/,1

Centralized Media's relentless BTC smearing,"**1) Media corporations are centralized and thus can push a centralized narrative:**

**2) This is made obvious with this video below:**

**3) Constant media smearing of Bitcoin is now obvious:**

https://imgur.com/a/Dwlpr

**REMEMBER** - Bitcoin (whether a store of value or currency) is fledgling form of money that is not issued by Central Banks. 

It has worked very well for South Americans in crisis, and allows the rest of us to participate in border-less commerce or store wealth outside of the banking system.

If I was a central bank competing with Bitcoin my mission would be to stifle growth in liquidity. I.e. Bitcoin is weaker if it is smaller. That is their goal.

How do we know if miners are no longer exposed to the inflation bug?,"To clarify, I talk about [this bug](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/).

I've just checked the websites and social media of the [four biggest mining pools](https://www.blockchain.com/pools), which collectively control 56% of the network's hash rate as of now.

One of them doesn't even have proper web presence (blog or social media accounts). The other thee have said nothing about this vulnerability, and make no mention of whether they have upgraded to software with 0.16.3 consensus rules or not.

This is quite startling.

The above article says that ""we believe over half of the Bitcoin hashrate has upgraded to patched nodes."" u/TheBlueMatt, how do we know this?",1537918481,25/09/2018 23:34:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ix9tt/how_do_we_know_if_miners_are_no_longer_exposed_to/,1
Opening pool to attack Bitcoin via recent exploit,"I don't have any hardware but ive got enough coins that we can double them and produce a decent payout for the miners involved as I'll be sharing the rewards for participating.  if you also have coins we can also double those if we succeed. the network hasnt updated entirely so its still a viable option.


 Just kidding but would this be a viable attack currently? Or has that window of oppertunity passed? I know many nodes have yet to update. 

Seems like a viable attack and incentives to do so might be reasonable. Especially if you're a BCH supporter like bitmain. ",1537918969,25/09/2018 23:42:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ixbwk/opening_pool_to_attack_bitcoin_via_recent_exploit/,1

Withdraw crypto to foreign bank account,"Hi 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I'm living in Australia, and very recently I invested some money in Crypto using Coinbase. If I want to get my money back (or what remains) I can sell my coins, withdraw to my Australian bank account and go the ATM to cash out or just leave it there. In my ignorance, sounds simple. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what if I want to withdraw into my bank account in the Channel Islands ? Is that possible ? Is it possible to have an exchange account, like Coinbase,  in a country where you are not but you have a bank account ? I understand that in case of making profits, if I cash out I'll have to pay taxes in Australia and I rather to pay in the Channel Islands because there're lower. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologise if I misused this terms that are very new to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot. ",1537946179,26/09/2018 07:16:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9j0ay6/withdraw_crypto_to_foreign_bank_account/,1

Export transaction history from ledger with blockonomics.co,"Hi ! 

 for the accounting of my company, i try to export all my transaction from Segwit btc ledger adress.

ledger live xpub is in wrong format and has incorrect prefix

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/680#issuecomment-389493743](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/680#issuecomment-389493743)

Thanks to Shiva from [blocknomics.co](https://blocknomics.co) here is the solution : 

\-the solution is either to use ledger chrome app in legacy mode

Or  
\-You have to convert xpub to ypub !

&amp;#x200B;

With that py script : 

import base58

import sys

def main():

  xpub = sys.argv\[1\]

  bin\_xpub=base58.b58decode\_check(xpub)

  prefix=""049d7cb2"".decode(""hex"")

  bin\_ypub=bin\_xpub

  bin\_ypub=prefix + bin\_ypub\[4:\]

  ypub=base58.b58encode\_check(bin\_ypub)

  print ypub

&amp;#x200B;

if \_\_name\_\_==""\_\_main\_\_"":

  main()

My Binance account was blocked 3 weeks ago and support has just simply ignored me. Have I lost all of my money?,"## Dear Binance u/Jager_Binance,

3 weeks ago you blocked my account and after a long conversation because of my “security issue”, still nothing. 

My account is 3rd level verified, allowing me to take out more than 100 Bitcoins per day, the account isn’t inactive or suspicious. As soon as I noticed my account was frozen, I applied to have it unfrozen, but then you cancelled that and responded me with documents request and I gave you at least five documents you asked for in order to verify it was really me and even had a more than hour-long video call with you. 

I’ve done everything you’ve asked by the strong deadlines you’ve given, and then you just ignore me and don’t answer me at all. I can’t get any information from you about the process of unblocking my account and you still have all of my money; I can’t get any of it back. Could you please answer me and give me a reason for all of this? 

Everything you’ve said to this point hasn’t been true or according to your rules. I’d really appreciate some clarity and some answers.

u/Jager_Binance 

**What I’d like to know is, what is the real reason for blocking my account? Please PM me!**

**Why are you ignoring me? Could you comment on this? Why do I have to make all these things public just to attract your attention?**  

**P.S.**

That was an official Binance answer before they blocked me in their official subreddit

u/Jager_Binance I have already provided EVERYTHING you have requested and more! Why are you still ignoring me after 2 weeks of conversations? You’ve given me no choice but to make it public. 3 messages without any reply!

Finished traveling around the world ... on 1 Bitcoin,"Hello BTC Redditors,

Just wanted to share a little announcement rather dear to me.

August of last year I left Portland, Oregon with a mission: see what BTC communities are like around the world...and make it happen with just 1 Bitcoin.

Finally made it :)

18 countries.

12 months.

1 BTC.

Bought it for $4,724 hard earned dollars. A month later in September I felt like a chump who bought a new car off the dealer's lot --- because BTC kept loosing value and sunk to $3,350. But I kept riding that rollercoaster. 

In December the price hit $19k. Just a few days before Christmas too. I felt tempted to cash it all out right then and there, let me tell ya. But a few OG's I met in Hong Kong told me to keep saddled on that bucking Bronco -- feel the adrenaline of the ups and the heartbreak of the downs. So I stuck it through. Man, what a ride. 

I put a little video together. Not super good at the editing, sorry. But here it is anyway:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjacVPEaCW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjacVPEaCW8)  

A few highlights:

\+ Met Vitalik Buterin in Shenzhen, China. Wow. Closest I've ever come to meeting an extraterrestrial. I don't mean that in a bad way, either. The guy towered above me (I'm not that tall); he was lanky and gaunt; I could see him thinking about 12 different things while talking to me -- each of them far more important than the small-talk-chitchat he was having with me.

\+ Met John McAfee in Singapore. What a character! Listen to this: I ask him what he thinks about the environmental impact of BTC mining (the hot topic at the time). He tells me ""I'll keep MGT mining BTC until the last polar bear drowns.""

\+ Volunteered at a diving school in Palawan, Philippians. It was a workaway type of place. The guy running it, Thad, was doing great things -- teaching local kids how to become dive masters so they could earn a good living diving with tourists. Great dude. A little paranoid when talking about him and crypto, but wow, in it from the early days.

\+ Myanmar (Burma). Holy damn. What a country. Incredible ancient ruins. Delicious food. And the friendliest people going through some of the toughest governmental financial bullshit. Corruption, wild inflation, demonetization. And people there would love to use BTC more often to free themselves financially (being part of the unbanked, after all) but they have some of the most fundamental difficulties: (1) shitty cellphone coverage and (2) rampant power outages. 

\+ Colmar, France. I met one of my hero's .... Anthony Bourdain. Talked to him about food, travel, Bitcoin. A week later. One week after shaking my hand....he took his life. I keep wishing I would have said something. The right thing. Maybe I could have made a difference.

\+ Amsterdam.  Used a bit of my almost-running-out-BTC to taste true wormwood Absinthe. I saw visions of Bitcoin absolutely crushing governmental fiat and putting Jamie Dimon and Charlie Munger on the streets! Haha no, I wish. 

\+ Finally made it! 1 BTC! Tonder, Denmark. Just across the border from Germany. I thought I'd make it to Copenhagen. I didn't -- but that's okay. It was a wild ride that opened my eyes in all sorts of ways. Sure I spent months and months sleeping on Couchsurfer's cots, eating the cheapest grocery store mark-down foods, and generally wishing I had cashed out in December --- but I would do it all over again, without cashing out either. Because being on such a strict budget forced me to meet people. 

Often times we feel tempted to use money to avoid pains. If I traveled on a big budget I could have stayed in hotels. Instead I couchsurfed, met amazing hosts, and told them all about BTC -- which sharpened my own knowledge. If I was on a bigger budget I could have stuck around certain cities and gone to BTC meetup's only on their set dates. But being on a budget I had to reach out to meetup hosts and hope they'd make time to meet me, trade BTC for fiat, and perhaps even introduce me to their crypto friends -- and they did, every time, because the crypto community is awesome. Around the world I met absolute badass crypto OG's, movers-and-shakers, and newbies too. Learned something from everyone :)

I suppose my mission resulted in a resounding answer: crypto will set us free.

So cheers to a few specific cool cats out there as well as the community at large: Thank you.

Buy or Sell?,"Not talking about Bitcoin, but about this latest story that Google has spontaneously decided to unban bitcoin ads on its website... Do you buy or sell this story? Google’s behavior is extremely suspect and random. What has really changed since June 2018 and earlier this year when they decided to ban Bitcoin ads? Nothing. Bitcoin was already falling and Google and Facebook decided to kick Bitcoin while it was down. Just like they choose to unban Bitcoin, they could re-ban Bitcoin ads in 3 months.

Venice Crypto Project | www.venicecrypto.org,"**Venice Crypto** project promotes the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the city of Venice.

The project can be visited at [www.venicecrypto.org](https://www.venicecrypto.org)

&amp;#x200B;

Every year millions of tourists visit Venice, a lot of people are using bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies now as a payment method.

Our idea is to create a real crypto island, the first crypto island, where you can pay any kind of service with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, I think that Venice is the right place to innovate and keep up with the technology that the world offers us.

Our team will help people, companies, associations and allow them to accept cryptocurrencies at them physical and online store (e-commerce) or for receive donations too; the people, companies, associations will decide autonomously if receive and accumulate cryptocurrencies into its digital wallet or if receive the equivalent in EURO value directly into its bank account in total security, as Paypal works.

The acceptance of the cryptocurrencies can enlarge the target of customers who can take advantage of the services that a company offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Since April 2018 some venetian companies received our consulence, now them accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at its physical store or online store or both.

These companies accept cryptocurrencies but them receive the equivalent in EURO value and these companies have already received bitcoin payments.

I am in contact with other companies and operators in Venice and the islands (Murano, Burano, Lido di Venezia and S. Erasmo) as clothing stores, accessories, souvenirs, various hotels and B&amp;Bs, private apartments, bars and restaurants, newsagents, greengrocers and associations no -profit (donations) that will soon join the project.

&amp;#x200B;

**Venice Crypto** collaborates with other companies of the italian crypto world as PDC Academy that offers courses for the people that are approaching the world of cryptocurrencies for the first time.

Another collaboration is with CriptoMap project, it is a smartphone app where you can easily find all the shops or companies that accept cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Visit our website, you will find other informations about the project.

Is being your own bank a foolproof thing?,"First things first - I support bitcoin and the entire sphere. With that being said - it is healthy to be a skeptic. I am fully prepared to be down-voted to hell for sharing a concern in this sub.

My concern: Imagine a world where everyone is their own bank. Wouldn't this make it easy for robbers to target people? If a robber went into a random house in today's society, there is a small chance the house has a large stash of money laying around - because its 'safe' at a bank, and insured by the government. But what if everyone was their own bank and had immediate access to their funds? The robber just need select a house at random, and alas, the persons entire life savings is readily accessible.

Crypto as a laptop,"This is going to be analogous. Bear with me. I think of crypto as a laptop. But instead of having one laptop you have 5. Why do you need 5 laptops. Well one laptop has WiFi (smart contracts). Another has Bluetooth ( SOV). Another one comes with a webcam ( stablecoin). And for some reason I have one with a serial port (scams). And the last one has Ethernet (utility token). 

Sounds great that I have all the functions I need. I can put them all in a big back pack (multicoin wallet ) to carry around when I need it. Don’t worry it has wheels on it. It gets heavy sometimes. I profess to be the talk of the town. 

Till one day I stumble into a laptop that has WiFi (smart contracts), Bluetooth (SOV), webcam (stablecoin), and Ethernet (utility token). It even has USB ports ( LN). I notice more ppl are using them but what’s the use. I’ve got better because I’m diversified. Even though I need to buy a new laptop with usb (LN). Till I find out you need Bluetooth (SOV) for usb (LN). I will just trade in my Bluetooth (Sov) laptop and get one with usb (LN) and Bluetooth (SOV). 

To my disappointment they don’t make those. I can only get a laptop with Bluetooth(SOV), usb (LN), Ethernet (utility token), WiFi (smart contracts) and a webcam (stablecoin). 

The moral of this is at one point technology converges into one. It’s all fun and games till you find out you only need one laptop. ",1537990643,26/09/2018 19:37:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9j5rec/crypto_as_a_laptop/,1

Short-shot block?!,"So since the mempool has been regularly clearing out at least a handful of times every day (for the most part) I have been very cheap with Tx fees. This morning I sent out a low sat/byte Tx and have been lurking the mempool stats all frikkin' day waiting for it to get added to the chain (5pm EST is almost here...).

Anyway long story short after over an hour with no found block we happen to get 3 blocks in rapid succession immediately afterward. Since I had been watching closely I noticed one of those 3 blocks (Block #543197) was barely a quarter-full. I know the miner who found the block can do whatever they want, but is there a reason they wouldn't have added more Tx in that block? Am I just not accounting for SegWit properly?

## Hi Alice,

## I want Poloniex managers to remember their official statement and give me time to get back my fund on legacy conditions. I made my intentions clear till deadline. I was going to transfer my money. But I had no possibility though. I couldn't trade, I couldn't transfer, I couldn't withdraw. Do Poloniex official statements mean nothing? Why should I seek for help on forums and blogs?

## Kind regards

## Евгений

**Hi, Dear!There would be possibility to withdraw my tockens if Poloniex kept its promises or that article 17 of User Agreement. The official statements were ""The exact date for this deadline will be annonced in Q1 2018. You will be given advance notice before this requirement goes into effect"" - I wasn't ""Withdrawals will remain enabled at the daily withdrawal limits prior the deadline"" - it wasn't. I made my intention to withdraw tockens clear before deadline and Poloniex just ignored me as its legacy customer.Please. There must be a way to get back what is rightfully mine.**

**Nice regards,**

**Евгений**

Gods be good, Alice. I've never was going to bother you again as was promised. But it's you who started to write me... And it was not your ticket either...

So be it. I understand your frustrations but please don't consider a ticket solved if it wasn't solved at all.

I have my issue in the same condition as half a year ago and two of my other tickets are not followed by your agents at all right now. This is the reason I have to (re)open tickets.

Now I want you to remember a little bit of the issue... 

You tell me about immediate verification, but you cannot (or don't want to) verify me with my ONLY government issued passport, which unfortunately in Cyrillic. And as I see it you couldn't stick to your timetable, you couldn't stick to your promises and you couldn't stick to your art. 17 of User Agreement but anyway you can stick to keeping my coins safe from me and you can perfectly stick to closing my tickets.

Tell me please how can I get back what is rightfully mine. It was Poloniex who could stick to nothing. Why it's me who have to pay for the mess Poloniex have done?

Nice regards,

Евгений

Dear, Alice!

I've been a legacy user.. Two weeks before deadline, despite all the promises Poloniex froze my account and let me do nothing to withdraw my funds. I had 2000$ withdrawal limit and official statement which anounced 2 weeks for withdrawal before deadline.

That poloniex froze my account two weeks before deadline is unwarrented and ignored the art. 17, therefore removing the access to the funds that are rightfully mine.

I hereby ask you to take this responsibilty and provide me the opportunity to withdraw under the original legacy conditions for a period of two weeks so that I had an equal treatment compared to the other customers.

Please help me to resolve this awfully inequitable situation

Forever Yours,

Евгений

"Hello, its been a very long time.","This post is a general vent. I don't have much to say, and I'm not sure who else I can tell this to.

I used to mine bitcoin a long time ago. I had a black Acer laptop and that thing was a wonderful monster that handled anything I threw at it. I downloaded the Bitcoin miner from a thread, it was a small grey box or popup in the bottom corner, which allowed you to mine directly from your laptop and save to a URL or notepad code. I also had the Google scan-key thing saved to my iPhone 4S. There was a basic website and if you clicked a button it gave you 5 bitcoins at a time, I think it reset hourly. I didn't use that website because I didn't see the point of it.

Yes, its been a while.

I don't know much about the currency in all honesty, I stumbled upon this subreddit from another game 4 years ago. I'm coming back because well I lost everything over again. No one believes me and I don't expect anyone to. I just need to vent. 

I had stored all of my Bitcoin on my laptop and my mother destroyed it. She simply smashed the laptop over an argument she had on Facebook. I was able to recover various parts and pieces, but I was young and didn't understand it was completely gone. She had run over the laptop with her car. Non repairable. I didn't have backups. I had written my paper wallet in a sketchbook which she led me to believe she had thrown away as well. I was heartbroken, I didn't know how high Bitcoin could go but it was climbing around 600? I think during that time. Once the market climbed last year I did everything I could to locate the miner I used, contact old friends to see if they had my sketchbook, any possibility to get it back. I was irrational. I admit that. I attempted suicide but no one knew why. They thought it was over school or maybe a boy. No. None of that. I had to accept my future was permanently gone. 

I found my sketchbook today. It was in her garage, at our old house. 

I felt so relieved, I could finally escape and not only live life-- but get a chance to genuinely enjoy it. I can move out, I can travel and get a better education and just live. 

 No. No again.

All she did was tear out all of my drawings, and as a result, my paperwallet. Ironically, I wrote how many bitcoin I had on a separate page and this number just stares back at me, mocking me. I'm not even sure if the code would still work. I lost so much before. It feels like I've lost everything again. It hurts so much. 

I had grown accustomed to the abuse and neglect, the evictions and food pantries. I settled for community college and got a really decent job! I love my degree and major, and I know I'm able to achieve something better I'll just have to work harder and longer for it. It just hurts. I had so much. This is evidence I had it. Proof I almost escaped. My life would be completely different, it would be so much better. But I realize what I had is no longer obtainable, its not even realistic. I will be stuck here. 

I 'm sorry for the vent I just needed to get this out. I was crying as I wrote this and I'm sure its filled with errors, but I really just feel better after getting it out. I'm not going to attempt suicide again as I've made it this far without Bitcoin I don't need to get back into it. I had my run with cryptocurrency and didn't protect it live I should have. Its done, and over. I need to get back to studying now actually.

"Weidex - Decentralized Exchange decentralized multi-signature escrow system that makes the exchange safe, secure and efficient","\# The name **weiDex** originates from the smallest denomination of Ethereum’s Ether token known as “wei”, “Dex” is short for decentralized exchange. Before we discuss weiDex any further, it is important to first define what a decentralized exchange is. A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that does not rely on third-party services to store customer assets or information. Instead, the trades that occur on decentralized exchanges are completed directly between users (peer to peer) through an automated process by the implementation of smart contracts. This is further achieved thanks to the usage of a **decentralized multi-signature escrow system** that makes the exchange safe, secure and efficient.

Earn Bitcoin Daily Via Pivot,"Register on PIVOT to get BTC Bonus：PIVOT is a community for cryptocurrency investors.

All you need to do is Read, Share, Invite to Earn Bitcoin

What's Pivot

Pivot, invested by Binance, is one of the largest and the most successful cryptocurrency community in China.

What is DBB(Daily Bitcoin Bonus)？

In order to encourage users to promote the Pivot community, they decided to organize a campaign called “Daily BTC Bonus” for 30 days.

What is POWER？

One bitcoin or more will be distributed to users as bonus per day，POWER is the certificate of “Daily BTC Bonus”, which decides how much BTC Bonus you can get. For example, if 10000 POWER is distributed to all users in one day, and user A gets 100 POWER, then he/she will receive 1% of the BTC in the bonus pool of this day, which is 0.01BTC ≈ 63USD.

How to get POWER？


Reading a post


For every post that you read, you will be rewarded with 200 POWER. The maximum reward is 4000 POWER per day!


1 or more BTC is distributed among its members everyday

However , the amount of power you have today determines the % of BTC you will get tomorrow

Power can be earned in three ways 
* Either through reading of news , you can only get maximum of 4k power doing this, reading of the news won't take you 1 minute. 

*The second way you can earn is through reading and sharing, you will share the news you read on social media , anybody that clicks the link you share , you earn 200power per read, earning here is unlimited. 

*The third one is through referrals , you can get more 10k power , you will get 10% share of the power of people you are referring

Then withdrawal is any amount but you will be charged withdrawal fees of $1.5.

It is also not compulsory you refer before you withdraw. 



Download the app, login in with facebook or gmail and earn your reward.

"UK’s HMRC Blockchain PoC Needs Experts, Policy Direction","So the UK's tax office realises they're short-handed and directionless. 

Head of Platform Architecture at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Richard Mander, has shared details of the department’s blockchain Proof of Concept (PoC). While he cited the potential benefits as being substantial, hiring and maintaining experienced staff has been an issue.

Speaking on the Govtech stage at Blockchain Live 2018 in London Wednesday, Mander discussed exactly what stage HMRC are at with its PoC, adding that finding people with the right knowledge and skill set to do this is becoming an issue. They hope to expand the project to host a second node in the near future but need to increase the expertise of their team first to make this an easier task.

BTC vs ETǶ - My portfolio - Recommendations,"So this is the situation of my current crypto portfolio:

* BTC (-19% loss)
* ETǶ (-67% loss)

Total portfolio loss is -29% representing 5 figures in losses (USD). The ratio is 4 to 1 towards BTC, meaning that I have 4 times more BTC than ETǶ. So at the current market cap, almost one third of what I have invested in crypto is gone. So the idea is, is to HOLD at least, until the portfolio reaches the positives, the faster, the better. What would you recommend me to do in this situation?

* Keep it as it is
* Sell ETǶ and buy BTC
* Sell ETǶ and buy other crypto (if so, specify)
* Sell it all and lose 5 figures",1538062552,27/09/2018 15:35:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jdwbe/btc_vs_etƕ_my_portfolio_recommendations/,1

"Well, if you weren't a Bitcoin maximalist before...","I confess that earlier this year I went on a bit of a ""mine all-the-things on day 0"" binge. Anyway it's been a while since I've checked up on them and after popping into Discord (essentially my social portfolio of altcoins) the panic made me realize something that everyone else probably already knew for days: The CVE-2018-17144 bug that was quickly fixed was also in most Bitcoin fork altcoins out there.

Some teams like Ravencoin are updated, but PidgeonCoin (an obvious fork off of the aforementioned Bitcoin fork) have already been exploited. Go take a look at PGN on Coinmarketcap to see what an unrecoverable smashing of supply out of thin air looks like, and be glad that the BTC devs really take their (volunteer) jobs seriously. It's one thing to read about but another to see on the charts (yeah... I have close to 100,000 PGN that are now even more worthless...)

My point in all of this rambling is: We all know that there were a lot of cash-grab-no-dev-support forks out there, but this exploit just expedited what could have been years worth of slow bleed as the poorly supported coins are exposed. I am sure PGN won't be the last, and I think it's interesting that what could have been a catastrophic bug for BTC may have actually helped solidify it's dominance.",1538067049,27/09/2018 16:50:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jejcd/well_if_you_werent_a_bitcoin_maximalist_before/,1

Make r/Bitcoin censorship resistent again.,"Hey guys,
I follow /btc since quite a while now and it seems too be full of posts of people complaining that they get banned and/or their posts get censored on the r/Bitcoin subreddit whenever they try to express their concerns about various issues.
I don't know if it is really as extrem as some of them make it sound like.
But if would be the case it would really suck big time in my opinion.
I feel like the bitcoin subreddit should represent the same principles as bitcoin itself and that is being open, neutral and censorship resistent.
I feel like the community can use the up/down vote system of reddit and highlight important issues or downvote unnecessary shit posts.
I don't feel like an centralized censoring admin is needed that filters content because this would be someone who could influence the public opinion by enforcing to leave out certain informations.
It should be up to the decentralized community to decide what's important and what's not.
Has anyone of you guys experienced censorship here on this platform or does anyone know who exactly is able to censor unwanted posts?
If you feel like censorship resistance in the r/Bitcoin subreddit is an important issue please feel free to give this post an upvote.

Taxes and editing .csv files via a script,"So, I have a serious problem. My taxes of 2017 are due at the end of the year and my tax attorney just told me, that I have to convert Bitcoin/Alt Pairs to EUR.

For example, that means I bought Ethereum with the Pair ETH/BTC, using BTC. Since the price of Ethereum is now listed in Bitcoin and the buy/sell amounts are also listed in Bitcoin, I will need to convert the Bitcoin prices/amounts to EURO using market data.

Exchanges provide .csv files that can be opened via excel or libreoffice. In these .CSV files I have 10 columns of which only 4 are needed for conversion and to make matters worse  not every row needs to be converted since some pairs are BTC/USD. These pairs are already in fiat currency, but I'd need to convert them to EUR as well. 

I HAVE a basic plan on how to convert the prices (hooking into the exchange API and requesting prices at a specific time, setting some conditions to only convert prices, if they are a BTC pair, let the programm or script rewrite the entire .csv) file but that's about it.


Problematic is, that I never progammed a thing in my life. I have experience with a few archlinux commands and basic Python skills (while and for loops as well as if and elif commands and I can define a simple function).

I'm not asking for someone to do it for me,but rather guide me into the right direction (should I  use Python, or go for something else and completely start over.

By chance I have seen that there is software creator by hackers that promise to add bitcoin balance in exchange for buying the software, generally they have videos that show that it is real.

Where can I buy gold for bitcoin (not BitPay)?,"One used to be able to purchase gold bullion or coins from sites like JM Bullion or Bullion Exchanges for bitcoin and save about 3% compared to paying with credit card. This was a prime application for bitcoin, since both parties saved money, and the merchant didn't have to worry about chargebacks. But now all these sites seem to use BitPay, which gargles my balls.

Running a lightning node? We're doing research &amp; need some data from LN operators. Willing to pay for extensive datasets.,"We're seeking to understand the differences in behavior and usage of LN transactions on a grand scale, and to compare them with blockchain. Mostly to see how it is working and how it grows over time. If it makes micro-transactions more popular, if on chain transactions increase due to LN participation, and more.   
If you'd be able to share transaction data such as what addresses have been sent to/from and amounts, I'd be very thankful. We may be able to send you BTC in exchange for this data, depending on how detailed it is and how large/old the set is.   


I'm working with a few people to see how these types of transactions alter the behavior of bitcoin users as well as the robustness of the LN, such as how much routing a single payment takes from each node from start to finish, etc.   


Hopefully can publish a rather insightful article.   


Also if you've an idea how we might go about getting more data asides from directly cooperating with LN operators and the blockchain itself, I'd be happy to hear it. We've just barely decided on this as our research project and haven't fully explored all the options.  


I'm personally hoping that this research can prove to be useful to understand the usage of bitcoin and hopefully this understanding will provide for further development to improve bitcoin. Additionally, it might reveal useful strategies for marketing due to understanding user behavior.   


Thanks. ",1538118733,28/09/2018 07:12:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jktv2/running_a_lightning_node_were_doing_research_need/,1

Should I invest in Bitcoin ?!,"Hello people 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I invest in bitcoin , I think not , well to be very honest with you  I don't have any experience in the bitcoin thing at all I only know that it worth like 6500 $ these days 

so I tried to  invest in Bitcoin and I found something terrifying for those who invest in Bitcoin 

There are websites right now that offers cloud mining so you just buy a platform and it generates  bitcoin 

so if everybody knows that mining we can simply get like millions of bitcoin and maybe it will be one day worthless 

(again i don't know anything about bitcoin but I'm just thinking about it )

the majority are scammers but there are 3 sites (as far as i know ) which offers real deals about it and it also offers free mining platform 

so you can simply sign up for these site and earn like 2 $ everyday x 3 sites : 6 $(in bitcoin) per day doing nothing 

and they got payment proof 

so what if we have like 1k signing up today so that's 6000$ per which is 1 bitcoin daily (30 bitcoins per months )

so after a few months bitcoin will worth nothing I guess

Bagaimana Sikap Pemerintah Asia Tenggara terhadap Blockchain?,"  


*Processing img rjde6z0k0yo11...*

**Saat ini, ada perbedaan besar mengenai hal ini di berbagai negara di ASEAN dan kami telah melakukan survei berikut di Asia Tenggara:**

  
• Singapura mengambil keuntungan dari kebijakannya untuk menarik proyek start-up blockchain  
• Vietnam mengalihkan fokusnya ke penerapan blockchain di bidang mata uang digital;  
• Setelah ICO, Thailand disetujui sektor keuangan dan bank mulai menerapkan blockchain;  
• Indonesia berfokus pada penerapan blockchain secara simultan di berbagai sektor.  


**INDONESIA**  


Pada 21 Maret 2018, asosiasi blockchain Indonesia (ABI) mengumumkan pembentukan resmi di Siaja, diikuti oleh baik perorangan, organisasi, pemerintah, dan perusahaan yang aktif dalam teknologi blockchain.  


**Untuk mencapai pengembangan lebih lanjut, Indonesia telah melakukan upaya aktif untuk memblokir blok di berbagai bidang. Dibandingkan dengan negara lain, Indonesia masih berada pada tahap awal pengembangan blockchain.** 

*Processing img emmr8k1s1yo11...*

Tantangan terbesar yang dihadapi perusahaan blockchain Indonesia saat ini adalah sulitnya mengikuti perkembangan teknologi dan efisiensi sistem regulasi yang masih relatif rendah.  
Pembentukan asosiasi blockchain bertujuan untuk membentuk platform peserta industri untuk menjadi mitra dari badan pengatur dan pemerintah mereka.  


Selain itu, Oscar Darmawan, ketua sementara Asosiasi Blockchain Indonesia, juga mengatakan bahwa dalam masyarakat Indonesia saat ini, masih ada beberapa kesalahpahaman tentang perbedaan antara cryptocurrency dan blockchain, sehingga asosiasi akan bekerja keras untuk meningkatkan lebih banyak layanan pendidikan dan pelatihan mengenai hal ini.  


**THAILAND**  


Sikap pemerintah Thailand terhadap cryptocurrency masih dalam keadaan bimbang.  


Pada awal 2013, pemerintah Thailand umengambil sikap keras terhadap pelaku-pelaku Bitcoin. Ini disebabkan karena masih kurangnya peraturan yang relevan, hukum yang berlaku, dan kontrol modal sistem untuk bitcoin.  


*Processing img uupgzpb81yo11...*

Pada bulan Februari tahun ini, bank terbesar di Thailand, Bank of Thailand menghentikan perdagangan digital aset (TDAX), karena ""operasi berbasis TDAX tidak sesuai dengan pendaftaran di Kementerian dengan tujuan komersial.""  


Kemudian pada bulan Juli, Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (SEC) mengumumkan bahwa peraturan penerbitan mata uang digital mulai berlaku.  


**Sejak itu ICO secara resmi telah resmi di Thailand dan menjadi manfaat besar bagi penerapan teknologi mata uang digital dan blockchain.**  


""Thailand sedang beralih ke era baru sistem pembayaran digital. Bank of Thailand akan mempromosikan perkembangan era ini. Seperti bank-bank sentral lainnya, tujuan kami adalah untuk tidak membiarkan CBDC bekerja segera, tetapi untuk mengeksplorasi back-office-nya. Potensi dan dampak bisnis. Upaya ini harus membuka jalan untuk transaksi dan verifikasi yang lebih cepat dan lebih murah, karena lebih sedikit proses intermediasi yang diperlukan dibandingkan dengan sistem saat ini, ”kata Gubernur Bank of Thailand Veerathai Santiprahbhob.  
**Selain itu, Bank of Thailand juga mempertimbangkan penggunaan teknologi blockchain untuk mengurangi penipuan dan melindungi informasi keuangan.**  
**VIETNAM**  


Minat Vietnam dalam teknologi blockchain meningkat pesat karena blockchain yang berkembang di Singapura.  


**Menurut media lokal Soha, jumlah peserta di pasar bitcoin domestik di Vietnam telah meningkat dari 30.000 pada tahun 2016 menjadi 60.000 pada tahun 2017, dan jumlahnya telah berlipat ganda, dan data ini akan terus bertambah pada 2018.**  


Namun, Vietnam masih belum memiliki platform perdagangan mata uang digital lokal yang matang Sebagian besar investor cenderung menggunakan bitfinex, keamanan mata uang, dll. Inilah sebabnya mengapa BTCBank ingin membangun platform perdagangan terbesar di Asia Tenggara.  


*Processing img biq3g6jm1yo11...*

Selain itu, banyak platform perdagangan tidak mendukung pengisian ulang Dong Vietnam, sehingga pengguna hanya dapat mengubah Dong Vietnam menjadi Bitcoin melalui off-site atau yang disebut pasar gelap dan kemudian berdagang, yang secara tidak terlihat meningkatkan biaya penanganan pengguna. Saat ini, BTCBank sedang dalam proses. Pada 20 September 2018, stasiun Vietnam diluncurkan, Pengguna dapat langsung menukar dong Vietnam dan berhasil menyelesaikan masalah meningkatkan biaya penanganan untuk transaksi pertukaran pasar gelap bagi pengguna.  


**Singapura**

  
Proyek blockchain yang memasuki Singapura telah melonjak dari sekitar bulan Oktober dan November 2017.  


Ini karena pengumuman kebijakan pada bulan September di Cina. September 4, 2017, Bank of China merilis nama-nama ""Bank Rakyat jaringan sentral China dalam surat Departemen Industri Informasi Kantor Administrasi untuk Industri dan Perdagangan dan laporan Komisi Regulator Perbankan China Securities Regulatory Commission CIRC pada pencegahan token hairstyle risiko pembiayaan,"" situs resmi berhenti ICO. Pasar ICO, yang tumbuh secara eksponensial di China pada saat itu, berhenti.  
Sejak itu, sejumlah besar proyek blockchain China telah mengerumuni.  


Profesional lokal untuk mengungkapkan, parkir Yayasan sangat mudah di Singapura, orang tidak digunakan ke Singapura, silahkan pilih secara online nama mereka, ambang nomor telepon dan informasi terkait lainnya dapat didaftarkan sangat rendah, asalkan modal terdaftar dari SGD 1,00 (RMB sekitar 4,5 yuan ). Kemudian putar di puluhan ribu hingga ratusan ribu yuan mulai, dan sebagainya lebih dari dua minggu waktu, Singapura organisasi profesional lokal dapat membantu mendapatkan semua pendaftaran dan kepatuhan masalah.  


**Pada saat yang sama, telah menarik banyak proyek blockchain dari luar negeri untuk menetap di inkubator Singapura.**  


Bahkan, proyek rantai blok ke Singapura dari Oktober 2017 mulai melonjak, menurut perkiraan, presiden dari Singapore Blok Chaining Teknologi Yayasan Zhu Hongbing, setelah September lalu, blok Singapura terdaftar Ada 500-1000 proyek rantai, dan jumlah ini terus bertambah. Tidak hanya memblokir rantai start-up proyek, beberapa raksasa rantai blok mulai bermigrasi ke Singapura.  
Platform perdagangan mata uang digital Firecoin memindahkan markas bisnis globalnya ke Singapura pada Oktober tahun lalu, chip penambangan cryptocurrency juga mendirikan cabang di Singapura, “Im Token” juga memindahkan markas globalnya ke Singapura pada awal Juni.  
Selain masuknya proyek blockchain dan kebijakan longgar, talenta blockchain juga telah melakukan perjalanan ke Singapura, dan pemerintah Singapura secara aktif mengeksplorasi penerapan blockchain.  


*Processing img wy6kvbl12yo11...*

Inisiatif ini telah memungkinkan penduduk lokal dan orang asing untuk mensertifikasi upaya Singapura dalam blockchain, menjadikannya negara yang lebih menarik untuk meluncurkan dan mengembangkan proyek-proyek tersebut. **Pengembangan blockchain juga tidak akan menghadapi tantangan kecil.**  


Bagi banyak investor, mereka belum memiliki pemahaman yang jelas tentang blockchain dan mata uang digital, ""masih percaya bahwa mereka sebenarnya tidak sama.""  
Untuk bisnis, mereka harus benar-benar memahami bagaimana blockchain dapat diterapkan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan mereka dan perusahaan perlu memahami cara menerapkannya.

**1 menit untuk mengenal tentang BTCBank**  


BTCBank berkomitmen untuk menjadi platform mata uang digital dan perdagangan mata uang global terkemuka. Perusahaan ini diposisikan untuk memberikan penawaran dan layanan aset digital yang komprehensif untuk pasar global, dengan fokus pada investasi aset digital, termasuk namun tidak terbatas pada transaksi mata uang, transaksi mata uang yang sah, transaksi kontrak, perdagangan derivatif dan produk manajemen kekayaan digital.  
BTCBank berkomitmen untuk menjadi aset dan platform perdagangan aset digital paling tepercaya dan aman di dunia, menggunakan kombinasi dompet dingin dan teknologi dompet panas dan mekanisme perlindungan cryptocurrency bekerja sama dengan lembaga keuangan tradisional.  


*Processing img v8j3btud2yo11...*

**Mengapa BTCBank ingin membangun platform perdagangan terbesar di Tenggara?**  


Asia Tenggara terletak di antara Samudera Pasifik dan Samudra Hindia, antara Asia dan Oceania. Sebelum penemuan geografi, itu hanya daerah anak perusahaan Asia, sebagai pusat antara Cina dan India.  


Modal Barat belum berinvestasi di dalamnya untuk waktu yang lama, dan banyak negara Asia Tenggara telah hancur. Jendela pembangunan ekonomi Asia pada dasarnya juga tertutup.  


Saat ini, ada kesenjangan besar dalam pertukaran antara Asia Timur dan Timur Tengah.BTCBank mengharapkan untuk mentransfer konsep domestik yang baik dan metode bisnis yang relatif sempurna ke pasar Asia Timur dan Timur Tengah, dan biarkan mereka mengakar. Pada saat yang sama, BTCBank berkomitmen untuk menjadi platform yang dapat mengekspor nilai-nilai dan bahkan keyakinan. Pada saat yang sama, BTCBank juga akan menciptakan platform pertama untuk blockchain untuk pergi ke laut.  
**Apa maksud asli dan tujuan utama dari pembentukan bursa BTCBank?**  


Sekarang dari latar belakang industri, Internet belum mampu menyelesaikan masalah kepercayaan online end-to-end, dan teknologi blockchain dengan cepat menebus masalah kepercayaan yang tidak dapat diselesaikan oleh Internet. Dalam hal ini, Anda akan menemukan platform perdagangan model tradisional. Itu belum mampu beradaptasi dengan persyaratan era aset digital baru.  
Di seluruh dunia, karena kondisi politik dan ekonomi yang berbeda-beda, perkembangan blockchain juga tidak konsisten. Penelitian kami menemukan bahwa ada kesenjangan yang besar di Asia Tenggara dan Timur Tengah. Sejauh menyangkut Indonesia dan Malaysia, ada beberapa proyek yang membuat dompet digital dan bursa juga hanya ada selusin atau lebih, dan di Cina, ada ratusan atau bahkan ribuan dompet digital, dan hampir puluhan ribu transaksi dibuat. Dari perspektif media, hampir tidak ada media mata uang yang baik dan sederhana di Indonesia Seluruh ekologi relatif primitif dibandingkan dengan kacang-kacangan.  
Dalam keadaan ini, kami mulai berpikir tentang mengapa kami tidak boleh mentransfer ide-ide baik domestik dan metode bisnis yang relatif sempurna ke Asia Tenggara dan Timur Tengah, dan membiarkan mereka mengakar.

**Sebelum blockchain menjadi titik balik baru dalam pembangunan ekonomi Asia Tenggara, mungkin perlu waktu untuk mengujinya, ini adalah waktu inspeksi yang cukup untuk memberi kita kesempatan pengembangan yang matang bagi BTCBank**

Stupid questions but what's the easiest way to accept Bitcoin on my E-commerce shop?,"
Hi guys!

First of, I'm super sorry I'm sure that this has been asked a thousand times but I'll ask again. 

I'm soon going to sell a little product related to cryptocurrencies and obviously, I would like to accept cryptocurrencies. I've already set up brainblocks with WooCommerce for Nano, but I would like to implement something as easy as that for Bitcoin.

Any tips? I see so many options but ideally, I would like something that automatically asks for the right amount to the current rate, that is free and that uses a public address I fully control.

"It currently feels like every chart analyst and every ""expert"" says this is the bottom and I'm bearish af.","In general I think it is always good if several indicators/reasons pointing in one direction. I see the following:

Previous bubbles have lost more than we currently have.

Previous bubbles had similar ""resistances"" but broke through them eventually and had then following crashes that were highly unexpected.

Metcalfes law says we have room to fall: https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-value-to-lose-43-billion-by-years-end-researchers-argue/


Everyone is expecting another bull run pointing towards institutional money. I think the interest of institutional investors is also increasing in the price and vice versa. A further price drop could make them less inclined to invest.

Previous bull markets occured after a first stable and the slightly increasing period. I think even if prices don't fall further it would go sideways for half a year.

In financial markets the obvious answer is often wrong. Someone always needs to be fooled in order to make money. I think this time it will be the chart analysts and experts who did not go through the last bear market (fucking endless). I don't say chart analysis is complete bullshit, it can be useful sometimes. But to rely on it 100% of the time can be misleading.

My best guess would be another crash of 50% bringing it to the 3k range.

Stablecoins will help cryptocurrencies achieve world domination—if they actually work,"Will cryptocurrencies ever become much more than speculative assets? If they do, the key will be a new kind of digital coin that is engineered to maintain a steady price. At least, that’s what a growing number of developers in the crypto world seem to believe.

We’re in the midst of a “Cambrian explosion” of such projects, says [Garrick Hileman](https://www.garrickhileman.com/p/about.html), head of research at Blockchain, a cryptocurrency services firm. According to a [survey](https://blog.blockchain.com/2018/09/26/the-state-of-stablecoins/) Hileman published this week, the number of what are called stablecoins has grown from a just a handful to nearly 60 in the past 18 months, and more than a dozen more are expected to launch in the near future. Hileman says the stablecoin rush speaks to a growing understanding that the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum “is going to pose a problem” for some of the most sought-after blockchain applications, like payments, lending, and insurance. And he says it reflects the hypothesis that nonvolatile digital coins can form an “infrastructure layer” that could vastly expand cryptocurrencies’ global user base.

*This piece first appeared in our twice-weekly newsletter, Chain Letter, which covers the world of blockchain and crypto-assets.* [Sign up here](https://www.technologyreview.com/newsletters/chain-letter/)—*it’s free!*

Cryptocurrency often gets cast as a new form of money that will benefit people who don’t have access to a bank account or a stable national currency. Another popular prediction among enthusiasts is that [smart contracts](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610392/ethereums-smart-contracts-are-full-of-holes), blockchain-stored computer programs that automatically move cryptocurrency between users according to agreed-upon conditions, will revolutionize the way we do business online.

But payment applications have so far [failed to gain much traction](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/bitcoin-s-use-in-commerce-keeps-falling-even-as-volatility-eases), and a fair amount of last year’s exuberance about the future of smart-contract-powered decentralized applications—dapps, if you prefer—has been replaced by uncertainty over whether Ethereum and similar platforms can live up to the hype. Ethereum and other currencies have swung wildly in price, and that could well be one factor crypto-payment-based applications haven’t seen wider adoption.

If the goal is to expand the user base, though, it’s important to be clear about what we mean by “stablecoin.” The term can be used to refer to a few very different concepts. Tether, a popular stablecoin that is supposedly backed by US dollars in a bank account, has been around for years. A useful tool for traders wanting to safely park their gains in other cryptocurrency investments without having to convert back into fiat money, Tether has inspired a number of copycats.

According to Hileman’s report, nearly 60% of the $350 million that venture capitalists have invested in stablecoin projects has gone toward approaches that don’t rely on banks and thus promise to be more decentralized and accessible. Some use cryptocurrency instead of fiat money as collateral, relying on smart contracts to manage the collateral’s volatility. But most of this funding has backed yet-to-launch coins commonly described as “algorithmic central banks.” Such a coin wouldn’t use collateral at all, and would instead use software to increase and decrease its supply in order to maintain its price.

Critics [doubt](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611370/stablecoins-are-trending-but-they-may-ignore-basic-economics) that these more complicated stablecoins can hold their pegs in the long run. The systems also raise complicated new legal questions, especially given that many rely on an element of market manipulation to maintain price stability, says Hileman. “It is very early days, not just on the technology side but on the regulatory side,” he says. “Trying to make too many predictions about where this will wind up is hazardous at this stage.”

Zap Lightning Wallet Question,"Hi, 

I've gotten a full BTC Node with Lightning node running on Raspberry Pi using Raspiblitz. I'm trying to link it up to the Zap Wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, when I use putty to generate QR code, it's huge - way bigger than the terminal window. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using a Windows 10 machine, and hitting cntl- doesn't resize the qr code. Nothing I've tried with computer settings has had any effect, nor has changing any window or appearance settings in putty have had any effect.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a note in the text below the QR code saying that if it doesn't work to use zapconnect -j to get an address to copy paste into my ios phone. I can't figure out how to use that command.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated.

A cynical twist to the story of Satoshi Nakamoto! Please don’t hate me for thinking outside of the box lol,"It’s 2008, our economy is in shambles after the  housing market bubble popped and the big bank bailouts were occurring. Everyone is looking for some kind of hope, some alternative to this corrupt banking system that people were starting to wake up and realize the damage they are really doing to our economy and the theft that is occurring right under our noses. Out of no where, Bitcoin.org was created and the white paper was being thrown around cryptography message boards and chat rooms by someone completely anonymous. Someone who valued their privacy THAT much to go to such great lengths to preserve their identity. The fact that the one single person/group has mined and acquired over 1 million out of the 21 million bitcoins is VERY scary to me... yes the wallets have remained dormant for quite some time now but this is where the pessimistic side of kicks in. The New World Order has spoke about a global currency several times.... knowing that the world was starting to catch on to a lot of their big schemes and ways they have controlled the masses for years(financial slavery through debt) maybe, just maybe... this whole entire system was set up by the N.W.O.... that maybe Satoshi Nakamoto has remained dormant this entire time because it’s not a single person but a group of people, that’s waiting on “hyperbitcoinization” and casually scooping up more BTC on every dip for their own personal wallets... that’s roughly 5% of the total amount that will ever exist... that’s more wealth than almost every country has in the world... and if they are quietly grabbing more coin and waiting for the day when fiat currency becomes obsolete, then they truly will be in control of the absolute biggest fortune the world has ever seen!

Sorry for the negative thoughts everyone lol and even if this is the case, I’m still buying coin!",1538152796,28/09/2018 16:39:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jojp4/a_cynical_twist_to_the_story_of_satoshi_nakamoto/,1

"I just got scammed... watch out, these guys were clever!","TL;DR: Someone called claiming to be the electric company. Said I could pay instantly using bitcoin to avoid service disconnect. Sounded legit since they were just a little unprofessional and poorly-trained  like many call centers. But it was a scam.

So this was a pretty impressive one. Actually it was more of a perfect storm of coincidences that led me to fall for this scam.

My condo is for sale and the realtor called me telling me she had  gotten a call from the power company saying that the power would be cut  off due to a past due amount and that notices had been sent. She gave me  an 800 number to call and a reference number. I need the power on for  the upcoming open houses.

I've not been living there for some time and even though the mail is  forwarded, I don't reliably get it, so this didn't seem that odd. I also  had a problem a few months back when I changed the bank account on the  auto-payment so it seemed likely that they had missed a payment and not  informed me. Getting that sorted had been a mess, so I thought it was  likely something was still unresolved.

I called and the representative was very professional and took his  time to look up my account. He quoted an amount due of $224 that seemed  about the right amount and told me that I could make a payment at one of  their payment centers immediately and take care of it. I could not  simply make a normal ACH payment since the disconnection was imminent.

I argued with the guy a bit since my online bill does not show a  balance due and I'm a long time customer but I also knew from when I  updated the bank info that their online bill system is total garbage. At  a certain point I just accepted that this company is stuck in the stone  age and can't get its act together.

So the guy gives me the address of a payment center and sends me a QR  code by email. At this point I don't think much of it but when I get  there it's clear it's a bitcoin ATM, but the place is closed. I call the  guy back and he apologizes profusely that he made a mistake for sending  me to a place that was closed and ... here's where they got clever ...  he said basically I had missed the window for payment and the service  would be cut off.

I argued with him about this and he begrudgingly put me on hold to  try to delay the service cutoff. When he got back on he said he had  managed to delay the cutoff until the next morning by taking  responsibility for the mistake with his boss. Keep in mind I had been on  and off the phone with them for an hour at this point, on hold several  times, and he's using call center and operations jargon without  explaining it in exactly the same way poorly-trained reps often do. It  seemed super legit to me. I'm very used to poorly-trained reps in large  US companies.

So I say to the guy finally, why don't I just send you bitcoin from  my phone wallet. He's not really sure I can do this (another clever  tactic) but we discuss it and he puts me on hold to talk to the finance  department to figure out the amount to send. I send the payment to the  address in the QR code. He then forwards me to the finance department to  verify the payment.

Now I'm on the phone with Financial Man who is typing away at a  keyboard. We shoot the shit a little about how great bitcoin is while he  waits for the payment. He can't see the payment and asks me for the  address I sent it to. It's the wrong one. I'm now livid since I can't  get that money back. He calms me down saying it just went to another  customer's account and he'll find it and return it to me. Takes my  wallet address for the return. I should have gotten suspicious at this  point but I'm eager to end this and get on to a dinner I'm late for. So I  make the payment again to an address he sends me and he verifies it and  tells me everything is all set. I write down a reference number he  gives me for the call and I run off to dinner.

So, reference number in hand, I call today that same 800 number today  to make sure everything is really all set and the number is out of  service. That's when I got suspicious. Googled the number and the guy's  email address and didn't find much. Called the electric company and they  confirmed I was scammed. Took all the info to have it for their fraud  department.

Moral of the story: Don't send bitcoin to people without confirming their identity first.",1538158820,28/09/2018 18:20:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jpf4v/i_just_got_scammed_watch_out_these_guys_were/,1

If a Coinbase hack happened...,"Hi everyone! 

Pretty new here, but was curious about your thoughts on this. 

I really like bitcoin and believe in its future and potential. However, if a major hack happened to Coinbase, do you think that could or would permanently destroy bitcoin's reputation? I know everyone encourages people to get their coins off exchanges, but it's clear that a lot of people don't (and that number will only grow as more casual users buy in). After the hack on Facebook today, it's also clear that no matter how much money you throw at security, something bad can (and probably will) happen. 

So if a hack of Coinbase happened, do you think it could permanently destroy bitcoin's value and chance for growth?

How does the BCH -&gt; BTC module in Mycelium work?,"I installed the module, and it found BCH on one of my addresses, and now gives me the option to convert it to BTC.

How does this work? Where does the BCH go? Where does the BTC come from? Is it using an exchange? Which?

The coins it found were on one of my paper wallets that I set up a watcher for. I just wanted to figure out what was going on before I import my private key.

I also don't see a way to import a private key into a BCH account.

What's with the 6 peers? Why does it need this? Not sure I like the idea of this interconnectivity in my BTC wallet.",1538170855,28/09/2018 21:40:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jr3vo/how_does_the_bch_btc_module_in_mycelium_work/,1

"The 1broker.com domain name is seized, US SEC Files Charges against the company","&gt; Currently, our top priority is to allow customer withdrawals. The company holds enough funds to cover all withdrawal requests, of course. Before we can take the required steps to do that, we have to seek permission from the authorities.

&gt; Why was the domain 1broker.com closed by the SEC?

&gt; According to the SEC, offering our Bitcoin based contracts violated US securities laws. Although our terms of service explicitly state that customers have to verify that using our service is legal in their country of residence, the domain was closed because a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation was able to create trades on 1Broker.

&gt; The services offered by 1Broker posed no threat to investors and since the launch in 2012, we were able to build a very good reputation among traders.

How can my app automate/broker a Bitcoin payment between 1 sender and multiple recipients?,"I need to app crypto payment support to my online business. Below is the scenario that I need my app to automate:

* Person A needs to pay Person B, C and D. 
* B, C and D will be paid different amounts of BTC (open to other currencies, but feel BTC is best given it's broad exchange support)
* It can be assumed that they all have wallets
* My app should allow Person A to make this payment as a single transaction (my app would take care of splitting their payment and transferring the correct amounts to the wallets of Person B, C and D.
* I would prefer if my app doesn’t not have an escrow wallet.
* I **strongly prefer a 3rd party service,** but I couldn't find any that solves this workflow. Worst case happy to code it.

Do exchanges use encrypted paper wallets to quickly top-up a hot wallet ?,"Let's say an exchange got a hot wallet, and if there's more withdrawals than deposits, after some time it will need to move some funds from their cold wallet to hot wallet, to satisfy withdrawal requests.

Moving funds from cold wallet might require actions from high management, and will be visible in blockchain.

The idea to speed this up and allow less senior personnel to perform the top-up:

Generate 100 new addresses, encrypt their privkeys with symmetric key, print encrypted privkey (along with other metadata about the address) on paper as QR codes, put them into envelopes, and put envelopes into safe.

When there's a need to top-up hot wallet, three employees go to the safe, open it (while the procedure is recorded on video), take one envelope, put a log entry into paper journal, sign that journal entry with their manual signatures, and then open the envelope and scan qr code into payment system.

As the privkey is encrypted, and the decryption key is only present on separate signer node (that may be anywhere in the world and even connect to the main system via TOR), employees or anyone who sees that QR code cannot steal the funds.

There's no blockchain transaction at the time of top-up, and higher management is not needed to perform it, because there is much less trust involved, and with paper journal and video, the level of collusion between employees needs to be much higher for them to steal.

If someone takes over the signer node, he cannot steal the keys that are not yet scanned into the system.

(currently we can do similar setup, but with money flow limiter settings - for example, an employee can increase money flow limit from 0.3 btc/minute to 1 btc/minute by scanning a QR code with the command for the signer, but if anyone finds and takes over that signer node, and this is not a multisig setup - its game over)

We can try to use asymmetric encryption to encrypt private keys for addresses, and then the key to decrypt them need not be known at the time when QR codes are created, but using asymmetric encryption will mean that the data size will be much larger (256 bytes for RSA 2048) and the QR code needs to be larger. Private keys for addresses are much more valuable data, and we are working with them directly when we are encrypting them anyway, so I think symmetric encryption will suffice here.

I think we are going to implement support for this scheme in the near future, and I wanted to bounce my idea against a collective mind before diving into coding.

Is there anything that can be done to make this scheme more secure or more convenient ?

Do the exchanges already use similar schemes ? What challenges they face with these schemes ?

Is it too involved and complex ?",1538204302,29/09/2018 06:58:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jukgo/do_exchanges_use_encrypted_paper_wallets_to/,1

Is anyone else astonished at the huge differences between people's life that money dictates?,"Ever since crypto gave me financial freedom I'm more and more astounded by how different people's lives are because of money. 

If I place a lucky trade I can profit enough to sustain my living for the next several months. I'm free to travel, experience and develop myself as I wish.

But what I see on my third world travels is taxi drivers who spend all day every day in the car, haggling with me over an extra 2 euros, waiters at restaurants grateful for my ""generous"" 1 euro tips, and basically people enslaved everywhere to their day jobs.

How is it that people still need to work just to ensure their basic survival, with all the technology we have? And what do the enormous corporations spend millions on developing? VR headsets?

How decentralized is satoshis.place?,"Actually I’m pretty sure it’s not decentralized at all, but it uses decentralized money, so that is ok. 

So I want to build a lightning web application and looking for pointers to start. satoshis.place has an api, which allows you to draw on the canvas and then pay using a lightning transaction. Does that mean the canvas itself is internally just a standard database of some sort? Do you think there is anything “smart contract”-like after the purchase is made to actually record the data to the canvas?

If it is a standard database, you just do a api call, pay the fee, and the app backend just checks the “lightning ledger”/channel to see payment went alright and updates it’s internal database and the screen. 

Let me know if you think I’m barking up the right tree, and if anyone has any more solid Lapp making documentation or basic example GitHub projects.

What are the different apps you can use to sweep bitcoin paper wallets?,"I currently store bitcoin on paper wallets and intend to hold them for many decades e.g. 40 years. When I eventually spend my bitcoin, I imagine bitcoin will be accepted everywhere, so there is no need to convert it back to fiat. I will just spend it directly. 

For general spending (mostly splitting lunch or coffee costs, tipping dogecoin on reddit, etc), I currently use both the Blockchain app and Coinomi app on my smartphone. Both these apps allow me to sweep bitcoin (or multiple other crypto) from papers wallets into my phone for general spending. 

However, when I ""cash in"" my bitcoin 40 years in the future, I am concerned that perhaps the Coinomi and Blockchain apps will not exist.

Biggest Bitcoin Wallet About To Be Secured,"Read this around coindesk

Back in 2013, there was initiated the biggest Bitcoin wallet. Held by BitGo it was about $10 million-worth of the cryptocurrency. Already seemed to be really high even for 2013.

Later, in 2015 they crept up to around $100 million. After that, by 2017 the largest crypto wallets in BitGo's charge reached close to $1 billion. 

Belshe about to introduce a next-level security-system: ""Now we are really thinking, what's it going to take to secure a trillion dollars? It may be a little far away, but we have to start thinking about it now; we have to start designing it now in order to get there.""

A complex security system evolved from hardware and software technology is going to be born. Looks like, the most advanced security algorithms are going to be developed. What do you guys think?

LEOOY pick-up bar A zero commission blockchain tourism ecology is underway,"The blockchain has developed from a small circle to a street and a street, as if it only took one night. This lively blockchain feast allows travel companies to find ways to sharpen their heads and drill in. The blockchain travel platform will not be absent. Today, LEOOY, booking and other platforms have emerged.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 2n3rnisbk5p11...*

In the eyes of the general public, the blockchain may be a Ponzi scheme; in the eyes of speculators, the blockchain is a stepping stone to the rich; in the eyes of many large institutions, the blockchain is indeed a capital Value-added ""toon"". From the perspective of tourism enterprises exploring blockchain technology, the current blockchain is used in the tourism industry for “transaction” and “security”, which is quite consistent with the characteristics of blockchain technology.

As a decentralized tourism market platform based on blockchain, LEOOY has created a new concept one-stop tourism service culture exchange platform that subverts the traditional concept of tourism consumption. Based on the consensus of the travel industry, the application of blockchain technology directly links travel service providers, consumers and third-party service providers, and builds a future travel service ecosystem based on trust, incentive and zero commission.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/50q71s9pk5p11.jpg

LEOOY solves four major problems, namely privacy issues, cost issues, credit issues and points issues that are difficult to protect on traditional online travel platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone who participates in LEOOY will form an independent digital identity on the platform, which is the “LEOOY Pass”. Participants only need to verify the LEOOY pass to verify the identity of the participants, no need to repeatedly authenticate during the subsequent transaction process, which greatly enhances the consumer's travel experience, while protecting the privacy of consumers and promoting the healthy development of the industry.

Based on the distributed computing and storage technology adopted by blockchain technology, there is no centralized management. Therefore, between consumers and businesses, peer-to-peer transactions can be realized, that is, consumers give money, businesses receive money directly, and no middlemen earn huge commissions.

On the credit issue, LEOOY permanently packs all information on the blockchain. Except for personal privacy information, all information is publicly disclosed, ensuring that all participation behaviors and speech can be traced back, and that the platform data is transparent and transparent.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2lhadb8qk5p11.jpg

LEOOY makes full use of the traceability and irreparable modification of blockchain technology to reconstruct the travel industry integration system. The new digital credits are valid forever and can also be transferred. LEOOY will make the most of the services and functions of the points, helping the service providers to achieve customer drainage and help consumers get the most benefit.

Some operators pointed out that the blockchain is very likely to impact the OTA business. Under the decentralized network, everything is done by the program, and it is safe. Users and suppliers can directly contact each other without a third party. Building a platform seems to mean that the tourism industry no longer needs an OTA intermediary platform. However, some people have questioned that the user's booking habits are now entirely biased towards booking travel products through physical travel agencies or OTA platforms. It is not that they arrive at the supply end. Is this intrinsically impossible to say that many users still need middlemen?

There are still many questions about the blockchain tourism falling. It is necessary to know that the wind is coming fast and going fast. LEOOY can only solve a part of the problem. The Internet has been able to penetrate so deeply for 20 years. Blockchain as a more complicated technology may take longer.

What do some powerful enough goverments actually do - Modern Monetary Theory,"I'll just paste it here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Modern Monetary Theory** (**MMT** or **Modern Money Theory**) is a macroeconomic theory that describes and analyzes modern economies in which the [national currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_currency) is [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money),  established and created by a sovereign government. The key assertion of  MMT is that sovereign governments that are the sole supplier of  national currency can issue currency of any denomination, and in  physical or non-physical forms. Consequently, these governments have an  unlimited ability to pay for the things they wish to purchase and to  fulfill promised future payments. MMT claims that these governments also  have an unlimited ability to provide funds to other sectors, and that  because of this, it is not possible for a government that issues its own  currency to be bankrupt.

A Story of Despair and Disbelief,"*Many in the crypto land have had the misfortune of forgetting their wallet password.  Few like me have been able to recover the ""lost funds"".  With the help from* [*Dave*](https://walletrecoveryservices.com)*, I got all my bitcoin back plus and the forked bitcoin cash.  Many many thanks to Dave and his service!*  

 

It was the December of 2013, a time when the 5-year-old Bitcoin market just experienced one of its most jubilant moments having reached an all-time high of over $1200 weeks ago.  The newly discovered investment opportunity was met with so much fan fair that it was already deemed (albeit a very tiny percentage of Internet population) the next greatest invention since sliced bread.  I was one of those fan boys.  Not only did I start mining bitcoin at home (and turning a small apartment into an oven along the way), I also poured some cold hard (fiat anyway) cash into an intangible asset few gave it any chance of long-term prosperity.  

Well, as the next gold rush raged on, a mistake was made when setting up a wallet, I forgot the wallet password and lost access to more than 6 bitcoins.  Many upon many passwords were attempted and none worked.  Days into this mess, I got wind of someone named Dave and gave his wallet recovery service a shot.  Dave was prompt in getting back to me with my inquiry.  His service fee was 20% of the recovered funds which I found very reasonable IF it worked.  But, no, Dave gave it a few go's after many password combination suggestions from me.  Essentially he was brute hacking the password using the wallet file I had preserved.  This was January 2014. 

In the next few years, I never gave up trying to recover this wallet.  Yet every attempt was met with the exact same failure message.  Not ready to throw in the towel, last year I hired someone to hypnotize myself to travel back in time to that exact moment the password was typed into the computer.  Nope, it probably would have worked for someone else but it didn't work on me.  During these last few years, Dave's email was always in my gmail draft folder, in the event a (useful) hint popped into my head.  

Fast forward to the present.  Dave pleasantly surprised me with a message telling me he had cracked the password.  He never gave up on the task from 4 years ago and using better computer algorithms he was able to un-hide that elusive password.  A few emails later, Dave delivered password and I was able to get the bitcoins back minus the service fee.  He was so thoughtful as to caution me on possible computer security breach and that I should consider encryption for delivery of the newly recovered password from him to me.

It was totally and completely money well spent!  I am now reunited with my long lost bitcoin, something that will be worth a lot more in the future.  Can't thank you enough Dave!  Obviously, I 200% wholeheartedly recommend Dave to anyone in similar situation for his great service, integrity and thoughtfulness!!!",1538239237,29/09/2018 16:40:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jyf5h/a_story_of_despair_and_disbelief/,1

**When  the price of the tokens changes the percentage of the deposit  proportions in the smart contract is violated. As a consequence, it  creates an interest in arbitration. A smart contract gives an  opportunity for the arbitrageur to exchange cheaper tokens for more  expensive ones, thereby restoring the given proportions.**

**Due  to the high competition among arbitrageurs, asset rebalancing occurs  immediately as soon as the interest of the arbitrageur exceeds the  Ethereum transaction fee.**

We need to strike now, while things are hot. In crypto win those who are always ahead of the crowds.",1538265373,29/09/2018 23:56:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9k1qdb/i_dont_think_bitcoin_will_increase_much_any_longer/,1

Question about restoring wallets.,"Will a .dat file generated from one brand of wallet software be useable by any other brand of wallet software? eg: core to electrum, electrum to armory

Will a private key exported from a wallet be importable into any other wallet? Export private key from coinomi, import it into jaxx or electrum etc...

II want to know so I can consider what could happen if I backed up something (a wallet file, a private or public key, a seed phrase) from a non-core wallet, and what would happen if that wallet software became unavailable in the future.

"I have access to a large storage facility with free solar powered electricity, should I start a crypto mining farm?","As per the title I have access to an industrial scale storage facility and have a massive credit of free electricity due to a significant amount of solar panel installations. I'm also a programmer and have a fairly basic understanding of building computer systems for gaming. I don't really know much about btc/crypto mining at all, but I think I have a good enough coincidence of needs to warrant really learning about the process and possibly starting my own mining operation. 

&amp;#x200B;

With free electricity surely starting a mining facility would be a fairly riskless opportunity? Of course there are a million other variables at stake that need to be considered and I really want to get peoples opinions on what they may be and where exactly I should start, if it's even worth starting at all. I guess my tl;dr question aimed at miners is, if you had free reigned access to a large facility with massive amounts free electricity what would you do to make the operation as profitable and riskless as possible?

Digitisation through blockchain technology," Blockchain is a revolutionary new technology which allows for the recording of any type of transaction into blocks of data, such as a digital ledger. According to the IDC’s inaugural *Worldwide Semiannual Blockchain Spending Guide*, worldwide spending on blockchain solutions is forecast to reach USD 2.1bn in 2018 – more than double that spent in 2017.

Given that the UAE is setting itself up as a world-leading hub of smart technology, it makes sense that it would be looking to capitalise on these figures. Last month the UAE government launched the ‘UAE Blockchain Strategy 2021’, seeking to conduct 50% of federal transactions using this technology by 2021 in the hope of saving AED 11bn in document circulation every year. (Arabian Escapes)

Use of blockchain technology would also change the real estate sector dramatically, eradicating the need for paperwork. In fact, the Dubai Land Department has already taken the leap and become the world’s first government entity to use blockchain to record all contracts and registrations, while linking them with various property-related organisations such as water and telecommunications. The writing is on the wall; new technology is coming to the mainstream. Following on from the government’s launch of the UAE Strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the UAE Blockchain Strategy 2021 will further revolutionise the real estate sector. The takeaway is this: if you’re an investor or buyer you should be following the blockchain trend closely, if only so you’re more prepared to operate within the new system.

Sell-only BTMs taking over?,"For about a year, my city has had 5 or 6 BTMs, and they all had the options of either buying, or selling bitcoin which is/was awesome. But now, today when I went to sell I ended up driving to each location and they have ALL switched to a new type of machine (all different, independently owned machines) that only allows the purchase of bitcoins. 

Is this a trend that's happening elsewhere? Personally I think it is stupid as hell, especially because they are all selling at least 2k above market price. 

Discuss these idiotic new machines, I'd love to hear some thoughts about what's going on with this.",1538289771,30/09/2018 06:42:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9k49zm/sellonly_btms_taking_over/,1

My personal life story,"Hi fellow crypto enthusiasts,

I have been a member of this community/space for a while now. I am fascinated (borderline obsessed) by all of its aspects &amp; possibilities &amp; I see a very bright future for crypto. I want to tell you a little story and I appreciate whoever reads this.

I met my wife over 12 years ago - as I was recovering from surgery &amp; chemo after battling (and winning) a fight against testicular cancer. She's the best and strongest human you would ever meet and she turned my life around. Without her I have no idea where I would be. You can see what I went through here: https://youtu.be/3TLXXxe1fas (please forgive the bad rapping)

A few years passed before we waited to marry &amp; start a family. However, she suffered from chronic renal disease and her kidney function was deteriorating. In 2013 she had to cease work as their function started deteriorating faster and dropped from 20% -&gt; 5%. Luckily during this time we found out that her father was an almost perfect match and he was willing to donate one of his kidneys. In 2014 she recieved his precious gift that allowed her to get her life back. She returned back to work part time and we organized and got married later that year. You can watch this for her transplant story: https://youtu.be/YHPgWUDQ0I4

We were eager to start a family, however due to our past medical history, we were unsure if we were able to. To our amazement we fell pregnant quite easily and for the first time in a long time we had felt that our luck had finally changed. We bought everything we needed in eager anticipation of our bundle of joy. Unfortunately, he was born sleeping. We were destroyed. Our future felt as though it had been stolen from us. Every bit of happiness vanished and we struggled to find our footing.

After a year of despair and hopelessness we mustered the courage to try again. The 2nd pregnancy was difficult and stressful &amp; my wife was admitted to hospital with pre-echlampsia whilst the baby was suffering from severe IUGR. Even so, in 2017 we welcomed our beautiful daughter at 29+1weeks gestation weighing 840g. We were ecstatic that she was simply alive and the 2 month NICU stay, with its ups and downs, didn't phase us because we were able to hold our wide eyed breathing baby girl in our arms. She's absolutely perfect! You can watch her journey if you like here: https://youtu.be/X7jZ70f5GAE

After another quite difficult pregnancy, a few weeks ago we were fortunate enough to be able to welcome another truly beautiful blessing, our 2nd precious little girl at 31+5weeks gestation weighing 1.4kg. She is doing really well &amp; is expected to be coming home in 4-5 weeks. She is also perfect!

During these years I have maintained full-time employment and have tried to save as much (or as little) as possible whilst providing for my family.

This time though is different. With our first daughter, we didn't have to worry about anything else, we spent all day every day by her side. But now we must split up and care for our newborn in the NICU and our toddler at home. I am currently taking time off work to care for my girls and our small amount of savings are slowly fading.

We have never asked anyone for anything before but I just wanted to reach out to this wonderful community and ask for a helping hand. Not because I invested more than I can afford or traded my investment to 0, but because a couple Sats/Gwei from a handful of you will go a long way in relieving a lot of stress off our shoulders. Even just being able to pay for a sitter so I can return to work would be immensely appreciated.

Note: I completely understand that there are less fortunate people than me that are way more deserving. From one crypto enthusiast to another if you can afford to spare a few Sats/Gwei it would be greatly valued and used to care for our little family, if not, I wish you well with all of your investments.

Thank you for taking the time to read this long post. We have had some tough times, but we feel that we are truly blessed and we are so grateful for everything we have. We hope that one day you all are able to experience the level the joy and happiness we are feeling right now.

Has anyone considered crowd-funding the purchase of the AsicBoost patent for intent of open-sourcing it?,"Seems this could be multi-fold beneficial:  
  
1. Remove miners' incentive to use covertly, and without segwit-activation, thus increasing global segwit adoption.  
  
2. Desuade the transfer of hashpower to the inferior BCH, possibly re-uniting the eco-system to some extent.  
  
3. Saving electricity costs and show the derisive media / eco-nauts that Bitcoin can make strides for sustainability.  
  
4. This could be a prime use-case for the B Foundation:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

### 2. Perkembangan Seminggu

**Offline**

Sejak pembukaan BTCBank Vietnam pada 10 September 2018, pengguna mata uang Vietnam telah bereaksi sangat kuat, dan massa telah merespon. Banyak platform belum mendukung pengisian Dong Vietnam sebelumnya, sehingga pengguna hanya dapat melewati pasar gelap atau off-site. Ini telah meningkatkan biaya penanganan pengguna, yang juga menjadi kerugian bagi orang-orang Vietnam. Sejak BTCBank Vietnam online, itu langsung memecahkan masalah pengguna mata uang Vietnam yang meningkatkan biaya penanganan untuk konversi Vietnam Dong. Sekarang pengguna Vietnam dapat langsung menggunakan BTCBank.vn, situs web resmi Vietnam untuk mengubah Vietnam Dong secara langsung. BTCBank mendapat pujian dari pengguna Vietnam hanya dalam 12 hari setelah mereka online!

&amp;#x200B;

Selain itu kami juga merayakan pada 18 September 2018 ketika BTCBank Vietnam memulai aktivitas perdagangan mereka, dengan acara yang disebut “Bonus dan Hadiah Besar BTCBank!”  
Mengundang Anda untuk mendapatkan Rolex, iPhone XS Max, dan BTC. Volume transaksi total BTCBank Vietnam telah mencapai 80 juta dolar AS, menunjukkan bahwa tanggapan masyarakat Vietnam terhadap BTCBank begitu kuat. Memecahkan masalah perdagangan mata uang Vietnam, hanyalah langkah kecil bagi perusahaan kami. Afirmasi orang-orang Vietnam untuk masa depan kita telah meletakkan dasar yang kuat bagi kita.

### 2.Weekly Development

***Offline***

Since the opening of the BTCBank Vietnam on September 10, 2018, Vietnamese currency users have reacted very strongly, and the masses have responded. Many platforms have not supported the recharge of the Vietnamese Dong before, so users can only pass through the off-site or so-called black market. This has increased the user’s handling fees, which is also become disadvantage for the Vietnamese people. Since BTCBank Vietnam go online, it has directly solved the problem of Vietnamese currency users which is increasing the handling costs for the conversion of Vietnamese Dong. Now Vietnamese users can directly use BTCBank.vn, Vietnamese official website to directly convert Vietnamese Dong. BTCBank got the praise from Vietnamese users in just 12 days after they go online.

***Online***

In addition, we celebrated on September 18, 2018 when BTCBank Vietnam starts their trading activities, with the event called “BTCBank Huge Bonuses and Prizes!”   
Invite you to get Rolex, iPhone XS Max and BTC. BTCBank Vietnam’s total transaction volume has reached 80 million US dollars, shows that Vietnamese people’s response to BTCBank so strongly. Solving the problem of Vietnamese currency trading, is only a small step for our company. The Vietnamese people’s affirmation for our future has laid a solid foundation for us.

"What would happen if a bug in wallet software caused millions in BTC to be stolen, or similar, and what can we do to mitigate from the fallout?","CVE-2018–17144 caused me to realize BTC is not as secure as I thought. It was so close to happening, we might as well consider it to have happened.

What are the plans for if millions of BTC is stolen due to a bug? Would they roll back the blockchain, therefore invalidating every transaction that happened within the timeframe the stolen funds were moved? It seems to me like the original owners/hodlers should be the ones who are safe, and those who bought the stolen BTC should be the ones without a paddle, but is this decided upon?

I'm asking because I wonder if I should hold products for an hour or so after payment is confirmed. Maybe less? Big news like that should travel fast. There may be interest in an Oracle people can trust to tell them if a BTC emergency like this has happened. This way we could design systems to hold the product automatically upon the Oracle's say so.",1538319681,30/09/2018 15:01:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9k6z2o/what_would_happen_if_a_bug_in_wallet_software/,1

Inflation Vs. Deflation in relation to currencies and their history!,"Let me start of by stating that I am a big believer that BTC will stand the test of time,however,the issue I am having is the ability to envision how that future will play out.Allow me to share my conundrum and I would appreciate any feedback or opinions on this matter.

When one looks at the history of money one can notice that every single one of them withoit exception is inflationary.From seashells to gold.The more valuable they become the more incemtives there are for people to either mine(in the case of gold) or simply provide resources to find them(in the case of seashells).Eventually,you will get to one of 2 points.Either an equilibrium between supply and demand is reached causing price stability or the currency proves itself to be unreliable due to high inflation(the supply of seashells is too unpredictable to be able to properly value it).Now comes Bitcoin where the laws of supply and demand is turned upside down.It doesnt matter how much demand there is,the supply will continuously decline as time goes by.The block rewards are set and it is expected to continue to decline.The Hashrate climbing only indicates the competition to mine and the rewards are set no matter what.So how can BTC ever reach a point of equilibrium in order for it to be a stable mean of transacting?I have seen articles with estimates of 1 to 100 million $,however,even at those levels,what can provide the counter weight to the deflationary character of BTC to prevent it from becoming so high that its use case becomes limited to people HODLING it forever.This argument can also apply to many other cryptocurrencies and I have yet to see a rational reasoning as to why BTC will not remain in a deflationary spiral forever.",1538325751,30/09/2018 16:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9k7sev/inflation_vs_deflation_in_relation_to_currencies/,1

The Million (Movie Idea),"I posted a bit of this in another thread but it didnt get any attention, Most likly due to it being burried under other replies. So i figured id make this its own Topic 

So the 1 million BTC locked away by Satoshi is a pretty fascinating thing.
I've heard a bunch of theories why from things like ""it was a way to burn them in the old days"", ""It was a way to show that people were using it"", ""hes stashing it to sell and crash the price when the right time comes"" ""hes gonna sell it as a contingency plan incase the wrpng institutions own a majoriry of bitcoin"".

Of of the abpve theories are pretty interesting. Some of them are more likely than others. 

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WALLET  BEING USED AS A PRIZE IN THE WORLDS LARGEST TREASURE HUNT/PUZZLE?

Clues that span the history of the sciences and math. Clues in different locations around the world,  from the small villages, to the hustle and bustle of some of the largest cities. Each clue leading to a other with the culmination being Satoshi Nakamoto personally handing over the private key to the 1 million bitcoin wallet.

Think about it, Satoshi reveals himself to the whole world after bitcoin is mainstream as hell and the price is oodles and oodles expensive. 

""Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am THE Satoshi Nakamoto. How do you know its me? (camera moves to his computer to reaveal 1 million btc. Everyone go bonkers) I have watched the world grow fond of my beautiful creation. I am revealing myself to tell you all that one of you has the chance at being the wealthiest human being alive, ever. I have hidden clues around the globe. With the right set of skills, determination and patience, the keys to my kingdom will be yours...or you may share those keys with your fellow man and enrich the lives of everyone, the choice is yours. The first clue is located here ( points to a small town in Turkmenistan and gives a cryptographic riddle) Once you have completed the challenge, i will personally reward you. May your diligence turn into success. Let the journey humble you...oh and have fun!""

(Video ends)

After the video is released the news agencies around the world broadcast it aswell. Informing everyone, ""the hunt is on"".
Everyone one and there mother wants the prize. Airports are flooded with people wanting a trip to Turkmenistan From governments, private banks, retail chains and investment firms to mom n' pop shops, college students and regular 9-5ers. Some governments crack down and make it illegal for average citizens to leave the country to engage in the world wide event while the politicians of those countries go to try and take the prize for themselves. 
 
So! What are everyones thoughts?",1538331490,30/09/2018 18:18:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9k8lix/the_million_movie_idea/,1

Why BTC will make it to 1 million USD within the next 5 years.,"We had the last big bubble at 20k with all the media FUD and we are still at now 35% of ATH. This means about 35% (not exact cause you now buy sell orders) did NOT sell. And I guess about 20% only did sell, because they are rich already.  
The best news is, everyone who is in BTC has a really strong believe in this. We even had already a big long -87% correction 2014 and now the next big long -65% correction and we are still not in any tulpmenia bubble or near to any crash.  
Why? Its much more simple most people tell you. BTC has already established a so big believe system and also, and this the second most important, ECOSYSTEM (miners) nothing can crash BTC. In the next years nobody can stop BTC. It will be much bigger then all are thinking now. Just look at all reported news from media on from inside crypto boards from 2009 to today. Every months, every year it was the same bubbles, talks, FUD, crash, and retrace to bigger gains. With worldwide tech innovations like BTC, the s-curve trend is always much bigger then masses espect.  
This huge worldwide believe and eco system cannot be destroyed anymore. Every ""crash"" will be cheap BTC for other people to rebuy.  
My guess is 30-50k EOY, 100k EOY 2019, 1 million within the next 5 years - and alawys with up to -100% corrections. ",1538336288,30/09/2018 19:38:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9k99t9/why_btc_will_make_it_to_1_million_usd_within_the/,1
