"Everyone buy now. You've seen the charts, you've seen the rises and falls. This is your chance to buy while the price is low and make actual gains on your investment.","Anyone still interested in bitcoin has beat the weak investors who got scared and ran. When people buy the dips, the price rises. Weak investors see the price rising and buy in hopes to catch the uptrend, causing the price to rise more. Buying is how you stimulate growth and generate interest. The world is still eyeing bitcoin. If we make moves now, those still hoping it'll go up will jump like wolves on a dying animal. Be bold. Fortune favors the bold, others will follow.

Handling Merchant/Consumer disputes and LN?,"Help me understand this line of thinking. 

As a consumer, once in a while I have a really bad purchasing experience, and have to issue a dispute. Maybe they seller sends the wrong item on ebay and refuses to acknowledge his error, maybe a store doesn't send my order and doesn't return customer service emails. It's not common but it does happen. 

With credit cards, I can dispute charges, file chargebacks, etc., and have some protection from bad actors. If I transact with btc or over LN, is there anything like that which can exist? Once the transfer is complete, it's signed and there's no clawback unless both parties agree, right? 

Furthermore, there's no way to have ""limited nodes"" or channels that follow specific rules if you transact through them, is there? I'm thinking of a channel that somehow lets a user dispute a charge and allows time for adjudication. Will we see banks or card networks like Visa set up shop within Lightning with their own channels, and instead of paying the merchant directly, users will pay over Lightning to V/MC for the transaction, and V/MC will have some kind of acquiring relationship with the merchant so that they can escrow funds and/or clawback in the event of a dispute?

Or, is there a reason why none of this would even be needed?",1517445274,01/02/2018 00:34:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uerb1/handling_merchantconsumer_disputes_and_ln/,4

How will bitcoin be valued when...,"We have nothing to value it against? In my vision of the future where bitcoin is used for everything, the value can really only be tied to the amount of circulating bitcoin. The more its changing hands, the less valuable it is. If people are holding it for whatever reason, the more valuable it becomes.

It seems that this may cause a problem whereby the price of goods and services has to fluctuate rapidly to accommodate for these market forces. 

If this is the case, it seems to me that people would for the most part hold off on making purchases until the market conditions are right which would put pressure on vendors to provide the best value they can.

Question About Paper Wallets,"I'm making a paper wallet generator with some cool nifty features, and I was wondering, can you use an encrypted version of the private key as a public key? I'm asking because I want to make it so you scan **ONLY ONE** QR Code, and it asks if you want to deposit or withdraw coins from the wallet. If you click deposit, it'll deposit them using the public key, but if you click withdraw, it'll ask you for the ""PIN"" which will decrypt the public key into the private key. This way, you don't have to hide your private key under a few pieces of paper which thieves, which allows you to carry the wallet in your pocket with you at all times with minimal risk. Is it possible? Thanks in advance!",1517454556,01/02/2018 03:09:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ufqcq/question_about_paper_wallets/,2

So I don't really participate in the cryptocurrency world as it's not necessarily in my interest but I just had a strange thing happen to me recently.

My Gmail account is secured by 2-FA and my account is private.

 I would've brushed it off if I only received the verification email but then it was activated soon after. I changed my password on Gmail and other important websites and also made sure my account was locked down. Is there anything I should be worried about?

LN question: RSMC vs decreasing timelock.,"Hi,

I am educating myself on technical details of LN. I'm a bit confused because in the videos like:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZps3yH4rd8

the way that is used to revoke the previous channel state is decreasing the timelock. Simple to understand, but limiting.

However in the whitepaper:

https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf

a Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract is being used, which seems clearly better, but I have some troubles understanding the exact details.

And pointers to more approachable documentation would be awesome. Thanks!",1517460373,01/02/2018 04:46:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ugavm/ln_question_rsmc_vs_decreasing_timelock/,2

Why it is bear now...FROM KOREA,"Hi guys, just a heads up on how things look like in Korea.

We are stuck at bear becase of KOREA. It is not actually a bear, but the Korea led December pump made it look bear. Let me explain.

Korean market always had premium, meaning the same coin was worth 5~10% higher, due to high demand, limited coin in each exchanges. The premium jumped to 60% at December/Early January. 

40% of the young people jumped in. What now?

Despite the correction from ATH is worst 40~50%, Koreans have -80%~-90%, becasue the premium also deflated to 5%. So -40%(coin price loss) + -50%(premium loss). It is a complete blood bath, with one 20s killing himself today. We cannot get out of bear easily, for SO many Koreans can't wait to pull out once the market jumps even a little. It's not like somone -30%. It is -80% for Koreans.

Look, the December peak was the abnormal part, let by crazy short term Korean money. Now we are back to normal trend. IT SHOULD't have jumped to 20,000 in the first place. 

I hear a lot of news about ""why it fell"". I think Koreans distorted the market in the first place and we are going back to normal now. ",1517463850,01/02/2018 05:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ugm5c/why_it_is_bear_nowfrom_korea/,10

Crypto Currency purchases are now considered Cash Advances by your Credit Card Company,"I just got this e-mail from CoinBase today and have to say this is really a disgusting move by the banks and I have to question if it's even legal.

&gt; Dear Coinbase Customer
&gt; 
&gt; We’re writing because you have a credit card on file and want to
&gt; inform you of a recent change that may increase the cost of purchasing
&gt; digital currency with a credit card.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Recently, the [MCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_category_code) code for digital currency purchases was changed by a
&gt; number of the major credit card networks. The new code will allow
&gt; banks and card issuers to charge additional ""cash advance"" fees. These
&gt; fees are not charged or collected by Coinbase. These additional fees
&gt; will show up as a separate line item on your card statement. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Coinbase does not know whether or not your card issuer collects these
&gt; fees, nor do we know how much they might collect. As a result, we
&gt; would strongly suggest switching to a debit card or bank account as
&gt; your primary payment method. You can do that on the following page:
&gt; https://www.coinbase.com/settings/linked-accounts. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Coinbase Team

Buying the dip / trading question,"Can someone please explain this like I'm 5. My little brain can't seem to fathom this at the moment. (Probably should of payed attention in school more. You can call me a noob if you want)

Okay, so for example let's say I bought a single BTC when it was originally @ $10,000. (I didn't, but let's make the math easy) Let's also say the current price is down to $7,500 at the moment.

I'm not trying to sell for good, but I'm trying to comprehend what makes the most sense here to maximize profits and stuff. Please educate me on the correct thing to do or what makes the most sense.


-Do I sell my ""at a loss"" $10k BTC and re-buy at the $7,500 level? Clearly im losing $2500.

So I'm getting less money for it, but buying back in cheaper? (Is there even any substantial difference or gains here, or is it basically even, or would I be losing quite a bit? Clearly there would be some fees I assume, haven't sold any yet. I just can't seem to comprehend this for some reason)

-Or would I just keep everything that I bought before and continue buying more at the cheaper level?


Someone school me please.

Introducing ePaper Wallets!,"QR Codes are a 90's thing, deprecated beyond belief, and are already being outdone by 1000x by Smart Posters, which use NFC technology. Now let's apply that to bitcoin. Sure, there are credit cards out there that link to a CoinBase account, etc etc. But those are stored on your hard drive, and are therefore not mobile, and can be hacked by people hacking directly into your computer, and same with phones. By using an ePaper wallet app (that's what I'm calling it), it allows you to store all of your bitcoin in a smarter paper wallet.

Here's how the tech works. In NFC, there can be multiple ""records"", which are different partitions of data. They can store text, a www link, etc. On the NFC Card, every Record will be a text record, and the data inside of them will reference a Private/Public paper wallet key.

&gt;&gt;Records on the Card:

    ""Public"": Public Key on the Front of the Card, not Technically in the Records on the Chip
    
    ""PVT"": The Private Key for ""Public"", encrypted in BIP38. Where money is transferred, but should NOT be used to store coins or used in transactions. Don't even give this to wallets.
    
    ""0"": The Main Private Wallet, used for transactions. Usually Nothing in it, and is in Read/Write mode in case of security breaches. If you wanna use this to transfer money from an ePaper wallet to another wallet, this is the key you would enter. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one, as it is calculated when needed.
    
    ""DEEP1"": Private ""Deep Storage"" Wallet #1. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one, as it is calculated when needed.
    
    ""DEEP2"": Private ""Deep Storage"" Wallet #2. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one, as it is calculated when needed.
    
    ""DEEP3"": Private ""Deep Storage"" Wallet #3. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one, as it is calculated when needed.
    
    ""DEEP4"": Private ""Deep Storage"" Wallet #4. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one, as it is calculated when needed.
    
    ""DEEP5"": Private ""Deep Storage"" Wallet #5. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one, as it is calculated when needed.

ETC, ETC, as many Private Deep Storage Wallets as Your NFC Card Can Hold.

Whenever an incoming payment happens, it goes from the public address to the ""pvt"" key. From there, you can use the app to take the money in your ""pvt"" wallet and transfer it evenly across the 5+ ""Deep Storage Wallets"", so all of your money isn't in the same place. If you wanna take money out and spend it, click a button and specify the amount you need, then it'll be evenly split from throughout your wallet and into Wallet ""0"", which you can spend. The entire wallet takes place on your NFC Plastic ""ePaper Wallet"" card, with help from the app.    
   
   
This will allow us to securely store all of the money on the blockchain, and to access that money, simply transfer the money elsewhere. No data is actually stored on the app, it is simply an intermediary, acting apart from your card. Simple, secure, painless, and easy for new-comers to the Bitcoin Community.

"bitcoinfees.earn.com fees recommendations push fees up for everyone unnecessarily, they need to change it. Please read and spread the word","I posted something similar as a comment at another thread, but I think it deserves a separate post because most people are unaware of it and unknowingly hurt themselves and everyone else.

The website bitcoinfees.earn.com has very useful information (all the transactions breakdown by fee level) but its recommendations for what fee to use are horrible. They recommend whatever fee will get your transaction in the next block, when most of the times you would prefer paying a tenth or even less and wait a couple of hours. I guess they use some smoothing function as well because right now for example they recommend 170 satoshi/byte, when 20 would get your transaction in the next block. Most people don't analyse the data but just see the recommendation which is misleading. They say ""*The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 170 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top*."" This is the fastest, sure, by **it's not the cheapest**.

This website is actually doing more harm than good with its recommendations because by recommending high fees it pushes up fees for everyone. People use the recommendations outright without analysing the data themselves, and even wallets rely on it. So right now for example that transactions under 10 satoshi/byte get confirmed quickly, people enter new transactions with fees higher than 170 satoshi/byte! The moment a few of those get stuck, this will become the new required fee for everyone (for real this time). 

People should instead look at what fee level the number of pending transactions is thinning out versus the number of confirmed transactions and set the fee themselves. And put some pressure on the site's admins to change their algorithm because it's hurting everyone (except miners).

Also, we should put some pressure to the site's admins to change their recommendations in order to reflect reality and avoid fee inflation. ",1517482997,01/02/2018 11:03:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ui07u/bitcoinfeesearncom_fees_recommendations_push_fees/,10

Bitcoin Friend or Foe?,"If a government bans bitcoin, are they not simply preventing themselves from monitoring bitcoin usage, as banning bitcoin just means that centralized exchanges have to go in that country, forcing people to start using bitcoin the way it was originally meant to be used P2P without centralized exchanges. Also forcing exchanges to move out of the country, which could in theory reduce the prosperity of the country banning bitcoin.

If a government does not interfere or illegalizes it, are they not simply giving themselves the ability to monitor bitcoin usage, as they can then force centralized exchanges to release info. If a government does not interfere, people will choose to use the easier option, as in centralized exchanges instead of P2P.

So for me personally, I feel the governments who don't interfere are superior minded. It's as if they have realized that bitcoin cannot be stopped, so lets monitor it at least. As for the governments who try to ban it, it's as if they have not realized yet that it's not possible to stop bitcoin (steganography as 1 example), and all they are doing is preventing themselves from monitoring it.",1517484087,01/02/2018 11:21:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ui387/bitcoin_friend_or_foe/,6

Opinion: All Crypto Must Go; Bitcoin on Sale!,"This month, I spoke about bitcoin’s first bottleneck, the price and the second bottleneck, exchanges. I feel the series needs a brief interruption so that we can discuss, yet again, the price; before we move onto different subjects, more technology related.

Some are calling this correction a complete bloodbath. I’ve read in many places how this has to be connected with regulatory scrutiny in eastern Asia: due to heavier restrictions being applied to crypto exchanges and mining companies, people are fleeing the markets.

Credit card companies to charge cash advance fees on crypto transactions,"Just got an email from coinbase 

We’re writing because you have a credit card on file and want to inform you of a recent change that may increase the cost of purchasing digital currency with a credit card.


Recently, the MCC code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks. The new code will allow banks and card issuers to charge additional ""cash advance"" fees. These fees are not charged or collected by Coinbase. These additional fees will show up as a separate line item on your card statement. 

Coinbase does not know whether or not your card issuer collects these fees, nor do we know how much they might collect. As a result, we would strongly suggest switching to a debit card or bank account as your primary payment method. You can do that on the following page: https://www.coinbase.com/settings/linked-accounts. ",1517488651,01/02/2018 12:37:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uig18/credit_card_companies_to_charge_cash_advance_fees/,12

Then it kept climbing. I watched from the sidelines while several people I knew made huge returns and it made me sick that i sold. Right before the all time high I couldnt stop thinking about this mistake I made and I FOMO'd.

Question about why a node should retain the entire blockchain history,"I'm going to run my own RaspberryPi Bitcoin node. From my understanding the node requires the full blockchain to be downloaded in order to operate correctly. It takes a lot of space. My question is, why not just download the blockchain as usual, compute the cumulative hash from the beginning to the current block and then store it instead of the entire full blown blochain? New blocks can be validated as well, a new cumulative hash can be computed. At any given time only the last 6-10 blocks and a single cumulative hash have to be stored. No need for an external hard drive. What am I missing? thanks

Indian FUD explained.,"Let's begin here - I'm from India. Our Union budget was held today, as is held every year. 
With respect to cryptos, our FM said: “The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system”.

But the FUD brigade has started to interpret this as a crypto ban! It's just the illegitimate activities he was planning on stopping - referring to money laundering.

So calm down and HODL, it's just the beginning of the year.

Some number porn for ya.,"Well, with the price dip the last couple months, I know it's painful, so I thought I'd bring some fun and rejuvenating figures to the floor for y'all. I hope you enjoy.

I primarily use the 200 day moving average to discern where potential floors for the bitcoin price may be, and so far it hasn't failed (usually we miss that floor by a few hundred USD in price, and we haven't dipped below the 200 day moving average since August of 2016, but who knows?). Looking at the 200 day moving average in greater detail (https://www.tradingview.com/chart):

-The 200 day moving average price is currently increasing at $38/day.
-Value recently went from 7724 to 7762.
-That is a growth rate of .499%/day. This is in line with historical bitcoin growth values (anywhere from .4 to .7% per day).
-Extrapolating that growth means that the 200 DMA will be 8922 by the end of February.
-By the end of the year the 200 DMA will be at $41000/bitcoin.

If you want to play with these numbers a bit more, you can use www.wolframalpha.com, and put in this calculation (standard compounding interest calculation):

Principle*([1+growth rate]^number of days)

The 200 DMA that I am using for these approximations and extrapolations is the simple one.

Hope y'all enjoy, and gain a bit more perspective in this painful dip. So far, the dip has seen us lose 52.755% in bitcoin's peak value ([ATH - dip value]/ATH)*100 = ([19600 - 9400]/19600)*100 = 52.755.

Historical dips have been decreasing in the past years, from highs of 90% down to anywhere from 20 to 50%. This dip is the biggest one we've experienced in quite some time. It is bound to stop soon. Hopefully we don't have to test the 200 DMA.",1517494400,01/02/2018 14:13:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uiz8j/some_number_porn_for_ya/,10

Bitcoin's Path,"I'm in Bitcoin since Nov. 2016. Until December, all I knew about bitcoin was straight up. I'm getting my first real taste of down (I'll HODL/HOUR through it though). Question: What's the path back up? Here's my guess:

Bitcoin is being heavily influenced by trading right now. It's lost a bunch of its adpotion momentum because of high fees and scaling issues. Other news hasn't helped but, from what I've seen, there was always good and bad news to deal with. 

The meat of my question is, if scaling and fees can get resolved (and adoption momentum can come back) do more transactions and usage as a currency stop or at least decrease/drown out the ability of traders and whales to influence the price so much?

The Lightning Network quietly surpasses over 1000 open channels on mainnet.,"https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/?100=

Lightning is quite possibly the biggest innovation in crypto in years.  Lightning can do what no other altcoin can ever dream of; unlimited transactions per second, truly instant confirmations, and all backed by high level of security.

Lightning is going to be future of online payments.  The developers deserve a lot of credit, as do the brave souls risking their Bitcoin to trailblaze this new network.  Great work everybody.

On a side note.  It's funny how throughout November and December, despite all the FUD about Lightning being ""vaporware"", segwit adoption stalling, blockchain congestion, and sky high fees, we saw unprecedented price growth, up to $20k.

Meanwhile, now that the congestion is gone, fees are down to pennies, segwit adoption has increased, and Lightning is here and growing fast, we see falling prices.

This market is extremely irrational.  Hodl on tight.  It's a good sign when devs are quietly making amazing progress amidst price drops.  It's just setting us up for the next big bull run.",1517495411,01/02/2018 14:30:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uj325/the_lightning_network_quietly_surpasses_over_1000/,805

Square Cash App and BTC,"Vent session here:

Used square cash app for the 1st time regarding BTC purchase/withdrawal. Initial purchase there is a verification process - this took almost 5 days. Off to a hot start... once that is done I send the funds to an external wallet - this is pending for almost 12 hours; keeping it consistent with hotness. I then say ""fuck this, i'm going to sell all my btc and get the $ out and start fresh somewhere else"". I sell the btc, it is sold, and now there are no USD anywhere in my wallet!!!!

"Chase charging out-of-network ""ATM"" fees for debit BTC purchases","Noticed two $5.00 out-of-network fees charged to my account dirrectly following the purchase of crypto with my personal Chase debit card. Not too long after noticing this I received an email from coinbase stating the following:

""Recently, the MCC code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks. The new code will allow banks and card issuers to charge additional ""cash advance"" fees. These fees are not charged or collected by Coinbase. These additional fees will show up as a separate line item on your card statement""

And on top of this Captitol One also began auto-declining all cryptocurrency transactions a few weeks back for all of their customers.... And as you know Coinbase doesn't accept Discover at all...

I have no outstanding debt besides student loans and a car loan and I make ALL and I mean ALL of my payments on time. Not one single missed payment. Shit, usually I pay my balances the same day they post to my account. But yeah punish me because some jackass maxed out his credit line buying BTC at an ATH and then couldn't pay it back when it crashed.

So I'm curious does anyone know of a bank or revolving-credit issuer that will allow me the freedom to spend my money however the fuck I want to without them charging me fees and shit? Because I'm tired of these companies trying to influence my spending decisions with these absurd rules!!

Also sorry for my language but I'm becoming increasingly frusterated. And before someone suggests that I use Gemini, Bitstamp, or CEX.io DON'T. I've tried using all of their services and am either banned from using them in my state or my ID verification is still pending.",1517500215,01/02/2018 15:50:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ujmfj/chase_charging_outofnetwork_atm_fees_for_debit/,1

Why are you scared by FUD? (and what to do about it),"TLDR: Those responsible for using lies or collusion to create FUD need to be punished by the community, they need to fear us and not the other way around.


So I've seen movements online in social media and connections take major action and cause change. Sometimes it's for legitimate reasons, sometimes not, but it is a proven tool.


Politicians have been outed, scandals broken, cruel people shunned or made known in the public eye, industry changes, issues spearheaded, and the list goes on...


Yet a few idiots promote lies, or a collection of media outlets or politicians collude to create easily debunked FUD sand nothing happens to them?


Seriously, EA micro transactions were moved against by the onion community and tools with the fierceness as if EA were openly promoting slavery to return to the world, yet some folks lie about crypto or pay off media to push false news and nothing happens.


We're sitting back fearful of what FUD will do to our balances, when instead the moment a blatant lie or collusion occurs those responsible should be utterly destroyed by the full tool set and movement of the community. Jobs should be lost, positions removed, media outlets enabling it completely discredited and then attacked until they are known as nothing but a propaganda source.


Now we can't just attack any news just because negatively affects crypto, some of it has merit from time to time. But we should start making examples of LEGITIMATE false news and collusion, they should fear us and reason.",1517500508,01/02/2018 15:55:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ujnmi/why_are_you_scared_by_fud_and_what_to_do_about_it/,1

Bitcoin from a financial perspective...couple of thoughts.,"I have a decent financial background and have run my own business for the past decade or so.  Couple of BTC thoughts to folks without any financial background.

1) Bitcoin trades live, globally,  24/7/365 - this is unlike the vast majority of other investment mechanisms.  Most markets have set open/close times and even ""circuit breakers"" to stop trading when there is too much volatility.  With bitcoin you see truly organic, unfettered trading.  A huge positive once folks eventually get used to it.

2) Regulation is a good thing - you should get tax statements (which requires some localized government oversight), you should pay for your mining electricity.  For BTC to ever hit mainstream (like being used on Amazon or Alibaba) this needs to happen.  Most ""negative"" news I see typically refers to this...long term it's a positive.

3) The behind the scenes on BTC is massive...miners, coders, brokers, atm operators, vendors, users.  When we find our center and can cap volatility to 10% a quarter we're going to be a part of something truly amazing on a global scale.",1517502705,01/02/2018 16:31:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ujxg2/bitcoin_from_a_financial_perspectivecouple_of/,3

Just remember anyone's advise to buy or sell at any given price point is not true financial advise and is in all likelihood self motivated. 

Suggestions to blindly Buy the Dip help stabilize the price for those looking to to sell or save their own stock. Suggestions to blindly sell for crash reasons give opportunity for people to buy up cheaply.

""I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.

It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website. ""Send X bitcoins to my

Why would a seller accept BTC?,"I understand the concept, the technology and the core principles behind BTC, but I don't understand its purpose. Or rather it's value. 

If I ran a company selling goods, why would I want to receive BTC as a payment? What is in it for me? 

Sure, you might say that you can convert the BTC that you get to FIAT currency...but then, if that is the case, why not just pay me in dollars? Why would I accept a form of currency which is volatile and non-regulated?

Let us assume that BTC transactions are happening at lightening speed, and everyone is using it to buy something electronically. Just like a currency. Now, if I imagine myself to be a new e-retailer who wants to be a BTC-exclusive retailer who accepts only BTC, I have a dilemma in my hands. What is the value of my products in BTC? Is the good that I am going to sell a 100 BTC, or 1? Who decides that? If the USD exchange rate is supposed to tell me how much BTC it is, then what is the use? It is just another form of normal currency.

Also, if part of my sales is in BTC, how is the accounting and taxation supposed to work? A company would need to work with two different economic equilibrium s. Profits in USD and profits in BTC? But the USD profits are making me wealthy, BTC profits are not...so why would I bother with BTC?

Do people think that in future all normal currency is going to replaced by crypto, or would they exist side-by-side. If so, how is it going to structured?",1517505986,01/02/2018 17:26:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ukcak/why_would_a_seller_accept_btc/,5
Why experts are calling for a boycott CoinMarketCap,"In an electronic letter to The Wall Street Journal, Chaz, wrote that he “did not realize what a big impact” will have this step and confirmed that “the timing is rather unfortunate”. Tuesday, January 30, CoinMarketCap is included again in the statistics data of Korean stock exchanges. After that, the total capitalization of cryptocurrencies has grown by $50 billion.

This situation has angered many experts. Mati Greenspan, an analyst platform for trading eToro, called “in a decentralized world does not rely on centralized information” and to [boycott the website](http://www.bitlex.win/2018/02/why-experts-are-calling-for-boycott.html).

Alternatively CoinMarketCap, we can consider the site Live Coin Watch, the main advantage of which is the ability to track price changes in real time. In addition, the site has a function of creating a personal account and monitor your cryptocurrency portfolio. You can also use Onchainfx, Cryptocompare, Coingecko. All of them, like CoinMarketCap, have centralized management, but, in the presence of competition, changes at one site will not substantially affect the entire industry.",1517505987,01/02/2018 17:26:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ukcan/why_experts_are_calling_for_a_boycott/,1

Hooray for Active Trading!,"Well team, we are well on our way to reaching our goal. For everyone that starting trading when I first joined Reddit in December - Thank you for believing in my advice. I'm sure it has been more fruitful than the old buy and hold strategy! For everyone that watched my trading videos and took my 72 hour challenge, you saw how fruitful it can be. Thank goodness for AI.

Keep trading - Pick your points and stick with them. When Bitcoin reaches our predicted low then you will have made a huge profit when the rebound hits.

I'm so excited for this chance for people that missed the boat in the Summer of 2017 to buy into Bitcoin at an obtainable price! If you are confident the price will rebound, then this cycle of events is very advantageous!

Hold your head high, the active traders are riding the waves like champs!",1517506454,01/02/2018 17:34:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ukecy/hooray_for_active_trading/,0

Some things I don't get as a cryptocurrency newbie,"(Repost because of a typo in the title)

I heard that bitcoin has a relatively large transaction fee with something like 20euros per transaction. Now who gets this money? Only those service companies through which the transactions are being processed or is there a company behind bitcoin/cryptocurrency which gets all that money?

Then the code of the currency is permanently checked by a open source principle where everyone has access to the code. But Who are the developers which decide which version of the code is being applied? Does this also follow that democratic blockchain principle? Something kinda like the majority decides what's is right. Or again, is there a team which has full control over the code and which would have the ability to manipulate standings and could hide certain things?

In general could someone post a link which explains how the different elements are regulated by a blockchain? I'm quite confused what can be done without any tertiary service and what cant. Baybe someone can recommend a book which goes a bit deeper into the technical details. I'd really appreciate that.

Taking on the governments of the world,"I think that the most amazing thing we are doing as a community it taking on the corrupt governments of the world. This is the real power of bitcoin, and clearly we can see that they are shaken up in a big way...

At some point news like this should increase the value of bitcoin not drive it down - as the reality is they cant BAN bitcoin without turning off the internet. And its forcing them to accept the reality that we are transitioning the power back to the people.

As more merchants accept bitcoin for goods and services as a form of payment the need to convert in and out of fiat goes away and thats what its all about.

so next time a corrupt government regime trys to ban bitcoin (try is the key word) we should rejoice and drive the price up up up to hammer the nails into their coffins. ",1517506786,01/02/2018 17:39:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ukfxu/taking_on_the_governments_of_the_world/,3

What has fundamentally changed from the day we hit ATH to today?,"NOTHING!

So this market movements (irrational ups and downs) are not because Bitcoin or its chances of success have changed much in the last weeks. They are mostly due to the fact that currently &gt;90% of the crypto traders are actually barely more than glorified gamblers wanting to make a quick buck in an almost completely unregulated global casino.

Focus again in the technology advancements that will make Bitcoin an even greater technology that it is today.

The higher prices will probably come alone, first we have to build the strong network. We're well on our way to do it.

User friendliness of the Lightning Network,"To start, I'm a Bitcoin holder and believer. I'm not swayed by any of FUD out there with onchain scaling.

That said, I do believe the tech that succeeds is often the easiest to use. Mass adoption requires simple solutions.

People like to swipe cards, tap phones, hand over cash, or just enter a name (like Venmo) and be done with it.

I'm trying to understand the whole LN payment channel idea. Let's say I want to buy a coffee...

Will we eventually be able to just tap our phones to the business checkout machine or something that simple? Will all the back-end of opening a channel, funding it with the right amounts, etc be taken care of? 

Or, will you have to open a channel manually, load it with funds, type their address to send it to, etc?

"A thank you, an update, and something to share with you.","[Here's the article if you're not interested in my personal story.](https://medium.com/@alexduplessie/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-february-2018-45c036451560)

-----------------------

Hi guys, you may have seen me around these parts or on /r/BitcoinMarkets before, or maybe this is our first time meeting. Regardless, I want to thank you for being a part of the Reddit cryptocurrency community, and I encourage newcomers to this place to stick around and read, read, read.

I first got seriously involved in cryptocurrency a few years ago right after the peak of the 1175 bubble. I had bought a couple Bitcoins to experiment with when they were around $4, but I didn't hold onto them or research what they actually could do. Once I fell down the rabbit hole, though, I was hooked. This place was an invaluable resource for finding news stories, related subjects, and technical breakdowns.

In early 2016, I had the idea of starting a cryptocurrency blog. I wrote an article you may remember seeing, [*The Dawn of a New Economy and Why Millennials Hate the Old One*](http://blog.millennial-investor.com/the-dawn-of-a-new-economy-and-why-millennials-hate-the-old-one/), which was well-received here. After that, I wrote a few more articles then ended up moving and falling victim to some life-sucking problems. Fast-forward to early 2017. I decided it was time to pick up the pieces of Millennial Investor, and keep molding them into something that I was proud of. I remade the MI website and began offering a slew of services to clients with the help of some friends I brought on board. This still wasn't enough, though, and I felt like I was betraying the cryptocurrency roots of the company by expanding its focus.

This leads to now. With the help of my co-founder and roommate, Millennial Investor has released some videos in a series called ""Should You Buy That Altcoin?"" They've been called stupid, confusing, and just plain weird which is completely fine with us as that was our intent. At the very least, they're helping us develop our video production skills. This *still* isn't enough for me, though, and I want to give something of substance back to the community.

To accomplish this, I'll be writing a recurring series called *The State of Cryptocurrency* which goes over notable happenings in the past month in the world of cryptocurrency. News comes incredibly fast in this space, and sometimes it feels overwhelming trying to keep up with it all. Reddit is an invaluable resources for amalgamating all these links in one place, but sometimes things get lost in the comments or are a few hops away from the original link. For those of you who don't have enough time to spend a few hours per day reading about cryptocurrency, I want to give you a resource where you can still find out about everything. Also, keeping up with crypto can be quite stressful. As an example, the South Korea ""ban"" news went on for days and caused a lot of anxiety for those of us glued to our screens trying to figure out what was going to happen. It's much healthier to wait for confirmation and clarification regarding an issue than to lose sleep speculating about the truth. Hopefully my articles help with that.

Again, thank you all for being a part of the Reddit cryptocurrency community. I would really appreciate some feedback on this first article, and if you enjoy my work, applause on Medium is always welcome and helps support me.

**tl;dr:** Thank you for being a part of Reddit's crypto community. I wrote the first article in a recurring series that goes over notable happenings in cryptocurrency over the past month along with some commentary. You can check it out below

Mempool and transaction fees nicely low. Segwit adoption growing. LN around the corner. This time feels GREAT.,"See: https://dedi.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#30d

See: https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions

Just over a month ago this subreddit and ""the other one"" was riddled with spam about Bitcoin's slow transactions and high fees. Where are those fudders now?

The mempool is getting close to empty with confirmations easily obtained in the next block for just ... 1-2 sat/B, maybe 5 sat/B if you push it.

Segwit's growing adoption should support further lower fees. And Lightning Network is around the corner with its (revolutionary) promise of much faster transactions, even lower fees and opening the door to atomic swaps across cryptocurrencies and thereby exchange-less trading.

We have only seen the beginning of Bitcoin and the cryptoeconomy. The best part is in front of us.",1517510461,01/02/2018 18:41:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ukwu4/mempool_and_transaction_fees_nicely_low_segwit/,45
Welcome to Bitcoin. It goes up and down a lot.,"If you thought BTC only goes up you were wrong. It goes down and up and sidewise all the time.

I'll tell you more. Sometimes it *crashes*. If you've been in the game since late 2017 you haven't seen a crash yet. So hold your pants. 

If you thought BTC will actually get big *fast*, again, you were wrong. It will take *many* years and trust me, once BTC starts showing signs of mass adoption - that's when the Government will start taking action.

And when the Government starts taking action - that's when you'll start seeing blood on the streets. Literally. And that's when men will be separated from boys.

And no, 99.9% of you won't be buying then just because you've heard someone quote Mr.Rothschild sbout buying when there's blood..

No, you won't be buying anything. You'll be shitting your pants. Literally.

So yeah, lay back, relax a bit and enjoy the cool breeze which are these current gentle swings in BTC's price. 

Because this is only the beginning.",1517510489,01/02/2018 18:41:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ukwz6/welcome_to_bitcoin_it_goes_up_and_down_a_lot/,112

Coinbase BTC purchase coded as Cash Advance -- Is it Coinbase or CC companies who code the transactions like that?,"I've read a few related threads on this &amp; thought I'd share my own experience, in case it helps anyone...

I made 3 (small) purchases of BTC on a Chase Ink CC this month.  Then I got an email yesterday from Coinbase warning users that sometimes CC companies list these as cash advances. 

The first purchase on my Chase Ink CC was listed as a sale. But, the next two were indeed listed as cash advances.  Thus, they will:

* incur a 26% interest rate (although I will pay them off)
* incur a $15 transaction fee for EACH ""cash advance""

Needless to say, I was pretty alarmed.  I called Chase &amp; showed them that the first one was a ""sale"" ... and argued that the others should also have been sales.  

Almost immediately, the rep WAIVED the two $15 fees. So, that was good.

I asked her:  ""Who codes these as Cash Advances? Is it the MERCHANT, or is it Chase or the Visa network?""

She said that the MERCHANT (ie Coinbase) controls how the charge comes through.

However, Coinbase's email seemed to imply the contrary. It said: ""Recently, the MCC code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks.""  This makes it sound like they ran the CCs the same as always, but that the CC companies simply treat the charges differently.

Seems like someone is wrong... either Coinbase is in control of how their transactions show up at CC companies, or the CC companies treat Coinbase transactions as they like.  I'm being told two different things.  

In the end, I got my ""transaction fees"" reversed pretty easily with Chase. I hope others do, too.  And, I guess I finally learned not to buy BTC w/ a CC anymore.  Still, it seems like Coinbase and/or the CC companies might see some class action-type suits over this, I'd wager.

Does Coinbase really force you to buy a camera if you change phone number?,"I changed my phone number a few months ago. I don't use CoinBase often but I go to log in, but can't verify with code. I try to change it and it pops up teling me if I do not have a fucking webcam hooked up I cannot send them a picture to prove I am me. how this has anything to do with changing over a phone number I do not know. Then after digging it says if I don't have a webcam to prove I am me (Verified account btw, not just some copy pasted pic that could be off the internet) I could use the app.

 Of course the app refuses to let me log in even though I have password and login credentials because the app requires sms verification.. so its going to the old number. As  usual I am replying to bots now  trying to convince me to read a wiki on resetting lost passwords (completely unrelated) in hopes for it to get qued for some human to look at it eventually and probably send me a link to some unrelated wiki in a few days.

Warning regarding Robinhood - they are not yet trading any crypto and they will not let you withdraw deposits for a week (on top of the ACH transfer time),"Hello /r/bitcoin,

I just wanted to give a heads-up in hopes that maybe others can avoid my missteps.

First, the Robinhood crypto exchange does not exist yet.  This is not clearly communicated during the sign-up process.

Second, if you transfer money to them, you will not be able to transfer it back to yourself until they have held it for at least six full trading days, which they claim is an AML measure.

I have written them the following email and I will update this post when/if they respond:

To: 	support@robinhood.com
Subj.: You are holding my money -- I want it back, please

Hello,

On January 29th, I signed up for your service after receiving an invitation from a friend under the impression that you were offering cryptocurrency trading without fees.  During the sign-up process, I was directed to link my bank account and transfer some funds to get started.  After completing the sign-up, I realized that you do not yet offer cryptocurrency trading at all, which was definitely not communicated clearly enough (if at all) during sign-up.

Oh well, live and learn, right?  I figured I would just wait until my ACH transfer completed and then transfer back to my bank account.  My transfer completed today but, when I went to transfer back to my bank, what do you know?  I'm not allowed!  The reason given was that there is an Anti-Money Laundering holding period of six whole trading days.  You will have to excuse me but that is absurd.  I have not transacted with these funds.  There is no possibility of money laundering and that would be straightforward to prove.

I would like for you to return the $4000 I transferred to you to my bank account and I would like you to do it today.  I feel that I was induced to hand you my money under false pretenses (""trade crypto with no fees!"") and that your failure to inform me that my money would be irretrievable once transferred to you was deceptive, at best.

If you do not intend to return my money to me today, please give me the phone number of someone involved in making this decision so they can explain to me why it makes sense for you to hold on to my money for six more days.

I guess the silver lining here is that you all are demonstrating why cryptocurrencies are exploding in value -- it is absurd that you all can tell me that I cannot transfer my money from one account that is in my name to another account that is in my name.

Thank you for your time and understanding,

"I wont sell and chicken out cuz BTC is ""crashin""!","I'll never do that! If it dies, my last cent will die with it. And im not rich to not care. I am just careless about FIAT! That's not freedom!
WHY?! You are going to lose all your money? all they guys in with tie and suit will say. Or the elders waiting for their pension. You worked hard for that money.
HAHA my grandpa worked hard for his money also and now it values nothing, so what's the differnce?!

I got to see the truth about the current finanacial system long ago when there was no hope of cracking it. 
I saw how banks and gouverments make you their slave. How people working years for them without money for your meals when at pension.
I got very confussed that most people twice my age had no idea and they wore saying ""that's how things work"" or ""its always been like this"".
And when you young and the elders tell you that, you tend to believe it. Obviously does not apply to everybody.
As I started traveling and doing gap year after gap year, I meet more and more people that wore thinking just same about money, banks, gouverments, politics and religion. 
That was all i needed, that was hope!
So in one back to home holiday visiting my family, I told my uncle (his is much into politics) that these bastards time is coming.
He asked me how and I had no convincing answer but this ""more and more people are realising whats going on and very soon something will happen"".

Kaaaaaa BOOM!  BITCOIN!

Indeed it happened. Bitcoin happened. Before the FOMO or the FIAT greedy driven crypto investors entered it. 
And just after the biggest market crash of milennials time. More precise ""exactlly on time"".

We had a crazy run since then. More crazy compared with this last 30 days has ever been. More exciting than last December. 
More satisfing than any news.
It is called freedom. Or at least the glimpse of it.
For the first time we had a chance. For the first time ""they"" wore affraid. 

Now back to whats happeining today. Its hillarious :))) and I will laugh at it by myself if you guys cant see it.
There is a chance for us to change the world and ""you"" think that it will be a easy win.
I saw many people saying BTFD at all time and now they nowhere to be found.
Thats the problem ""you"" all have. An you know who you are!
In this times you can see who are the JUDA'S in the crypto movement.
Who will sell BTC to save some FIAT. Who trades like a mercenar (only careing about his own ass) in fiat.
This type of people whitout knowing most of them (because greed blinds you) will be the mercenaries of bitcoin. 
Without even getting paid by the gouverments and banks! 
They will do the dirty work without knowing and will tap eachother on the shoulder saying ""good call to get out"".

But to all of these I will thell you this:

 Bitcoin wont die.
 It wont be killed. 
 It wont come second.
 It will rise as never before.
 
It is not designed to fail. It is designed with an exact purpose, TO BRING BENEFITS TO HUMANKIND! To make us better again.
I can only fail if theres no humanity nd if thats not there, then we have bigger problems than gouverments and banks.
Sometimes I feel BITCOIN does a strong hand selection, where the not needed get out.
I am a trader myself but just because its a way to accumulate more BTC :)

I think there are noumerous gramatical mistakes. So, be humble english its not my podium language.

Not Understanding How to Short On Kraken,"hello all,

i am having a heck of a time trying to understand how shorting works on Kraken.

please do not comment on your opinion about kraken, the exchange. 
i am personally only interested in the mechanics of how it works.

my question does not imply i will be using or margin trading at all.

i only want to understand in exact detail the process as kraken is the ONLY exchange i am aware of that even allows this process.

can anyone help me understand what is going on and how to actually trade a short position?

i saw their video that does more to confuse than clarify.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKbltL3kCw

lets start with an example.

if i have in my kraken account $1,000 USD.
let's say bitcoin is at $10,000 USD.

i expect it to go to $9,000 USD.

if i understand correctly, if i want to short it, then i need to borrow the bitcoin and sell it at $10,000, and then buy it back if it hits my lower target.

but here is where i start to get very confused.

lets say i have no bitcoin and only usd in my account.
so to short, i place a sell order for .1 bitcoin ($1,000 USD) at 2x leverage

what does this actually mean?

i understand that i will be borrowing the full .1 bitcoin to be able to sell it, but what does the leverage imply at that moment?

and how do i close the position?

i would have to buy back the bitcoin, but do i have to buy back at the same 2x leverage level?

what happens and how does that affect my example if i choose a different leverage amount?

i am hoping someone can break down my example with how everything affects the numbers at specific moments during the trade.

this is all so very confusing and much more so than i think it needs to be.

really hoping someone can help me clarify whats actually going on.

i appreciate it.",1517513176,01/02/2018 19:26:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ul97i/not_understanding_how_to_short_on_kraken/,0

Is this Mining Hardware Site Legit?,"Hello miners, 

I've recently been looking into buying a second GPU for my GTX 1080 bitcoin mining setup.  I stumbled upon this site based on sales ads from Facebook and I cannot verify if this is a legitimate site or not.  They are well priced and have plenty of reviews on Facebook but no reviews from a independent source (not affiliated with the site itself).  My question is...have any of you seen this site and or purchased from them? If so what were your experiences?

Holding does not always work out,"People keep saying just hold and in the long term it will go up. Surviving 5 market crashes taught me it does not. Some times things never go back to the old price.

If everything eventually went up there would be no such thing as 2% CD's and 3% government bonds.  Nothing is guaranteed to go up in the long run.

So if you are holding make sure its for the right reasons. Not just, hey it went up the last time!

Personally I think this is only the beginning. I can easily see a round trip and BTC going back to sub $1000 this year. This happens all the time with stocks and other assets. I also would not be surprised if it reaches $40,000 this year. 

Its not about holding.

CMC Alert app - Get sad by simply watching your notifications tab (Android),"Thats right, a simple pin notification to show you the current state of the market cap.

This app gives you basic information about the total coin market cap in a simple user friendly way.

A notification is pinned to your notification tab giving you the latest updates and shows you the difference since the last time you checked.

&amp;nbsp;

You also have the choice to refresh the tab every 30 mins, 1 hour, 2 hour and so on given the fact that you have your internet connection turned on. Why should you use it:

* It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.

+ It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there, **heck your wife would never know that you are constantly checking the cap.**

- **It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.**

&amp;nbsp;

Update are coming constantly

"Let me tell you a story about Billy, $7 bills, and autism","I'm going to explain how market valuations work, how pricing works and is determined, and I'm going to do it by telling you a story about Billy, $7 bills and Autism. *My apologies for autism insensitivity.*

Billy is a fucking retard that grew up with no friends. Sure Chad and Fuckface  (unfortunate name) grew up on his street, but they never took Billy seriously, mostly because he was always eating glue.

These kids grew up and Chad married his high school sweetheart and became mayor of shitville. Fuckface, despite his shitty parents was a pretty smart kid and ended up getting 8 PHDs and a great job on Wall street.

One day, Billy got bored of tanking on his meat and went for a walk in the woods where he found a door under some leaves. He went inside and found a factory and a bunch of spooky skeletons. The factory made $7 bills, and there was 10 million of them.

Billy got pretty happy about this and went around trying to buy some fidget spinners in town but nobody would accept them as legal tender. Billy was sad. His bills were worth zero.

One day his toilet clogged because he tried flushing his $7 bills in frustration so he called Derek the plumber. Derek offered Billy $1 per bill, but only had $1000 to spend. Billy gladly accepted. Derek unclogged his toilet for him.

Billy didn't know it (he's fucking retarded after all) but his $7 bills marketcap was now $10M, even though only $1000 was spent. It had risen to this because Billy had found a buyer willing to pay $1 per bill, thus that is the value of his cache. 

Billy, being a retard, thought his bills were still useless but Derek kept coming over once a week offering to buy some bills for $1 each. Eventually word spread around town and he had many people knocking on his door. 

Oddly enough, even though now $10000 had been spent, when he checked CMC he noticed that his bills marketcap was still only $10M. 

He thought this was strange so he decided he would stop giving away his $7 bills for $1. The total amount of money he made so far was $1000, or rather $900 because he still owed Chad $100 for the $5 loan he took out back in 1982 to buy his green turtle pool that Billy still bathed in.

Or at least that's what he believed.  In fact his paper portfolio was very likely ""worth"" much MUCH more ($7 bills and all. However since Derek was the only seller, and since Billy was gladly accepting $1 each, and since Billy represented 100% of all sellers, his erroneous perceived value of $1 actually made the $7 bill worth $1 in reality, regardless of what number is printed on the face of it. You see, if I haven't mentioned this already, he's a fucking retard.

Now the citizens of Shitville, being not much smarter than Billy, decide that he must also be right about the value of this $7 bill (being worth only $1, because seriously, who makes a $7 bill anyways?). So the town has generally agreed that these $7 bills should be worth $1 each and stores even start accepting them as barter. 

As time goes by, Fuckface returns home from the big city. He hears about this new bill and investigates. It turns out these are the real deal, and even have official serial codes n shit. He still doesn't think anyone outside shitville is stupid enough to buy a $7 though. Nonetheless word spreads around town that Fuckface thinks these are real. People start offering $2 a bill, then 3, then $4, etc. 

You see this is how the value of an asset is determined. Something is only worth what the general consensus believes it is worth.

Time goes by and price has risen above $7 to $10. These have some cool art on the after all and they have become a status symbol. Sure it says $7 on it, but when Billy takes it to Fred the grocer, Fred let's him take home $10 worth of pornmags so who cares?

Chad gets wind of this and calls Fuckface up. Fuckface starts seeing people in the big city start carrying these $7 bills around as a fad. Fuckface and Chad are no dummies though, but they kind of want a part of the pie. It turns out these have value more than the $7 printed on them because they are rare as fuck and are collectables.

Chad and Fuckface, after being sad that they missed the boat, come up with an ingenious plan. 

The next day at the council meeting, Chad announces that the factory condition these were printed in was dangerous. Anyone holding the $7 bills were very likely to catch autism.

As news of this meeting (and that super smart and handsome Fuckface backing it), all autistics in shitville who are unable to think for themselves believe these bills cause autism. All of a sudden what was once a 100M market cap bill crashes to $20M, $2 per bill, literally instantly. 

It could have crashed to zero, but you see many people in town, being already fully autistic, are unafraid. Every single autistic person now controlled all these coins. Except for two others, you guessed it, Fuckface and Chad, who gobbled up as many as they could.

The market cap is now $20M.

A day later, one autistic sells a coin to another autistic (one single coin) for $1. The market cap is now $10M.

Now $1M did not exit the system. Only $1 did. 

You see, once the General consensus was that people should no longer trade a $10 bill for this new $7 bill, and even worst it was only worth $1 coin, the ""value"" immediately fell to that point. This happened the very second one of the autistics were able to get their hand on one single bill for $1. The seller determined he would meet the sale price, and since nobody else was willing to buy it for $2, the entirety of every single bill is now worth $1 each until people decide otherwise.

It remained at this value for a long time, as nobody was brave enough to get autism, not even Chad and Fuckface, because they just took a 50% hit and were afraid only autistics would buy their coin, and only for $1 now.

Billy, after starting with 10 million $7 bills no longer has any $7 bills. Despite being fully autistic, he was afraid to keep any $7 bills because of double autism reasons.

Regardless, Chad and Fuckface assess their situation and realize they are surrounded by idiots and that they are the only people that know that $7 are truly legit.

fuckface, who is greatly respected, makes a press announcement that he has conducted research, and his 53 PHDs conclude that the $7 is both totally legit and free of any autistic pathogens such as trace vaccinations.

Long term, the $7 bill returns to its full value, and even a bit higher due to its rarity. You see, Fuckface fell down the stairs carrying his bags and died on impact. His entire stash was auctioned off and people paid extra for this collectable, because he scribbled a minuscule dickbutt in the corner of every bill and signed, ""Bamboozled - Fuckface"".

TLDR - don't let Fuckface convince you that your $7 bill is worth $1, because the moment you do, that very second, IT IS.  Even if little to no money actually left the fucking system.

You. fucking. Autistics.",1517521637,01/02/2018 21:47:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7umbtl/let_me_tell_you_a_story_about_billy_7_bills_and/,400

How much power do Bitcoin miners have?,"I've been seeing massive amounts of big firms investing in bitcoin mining. Here in Canada they are popping up, Samsung is getting into making asic chips for it. They've obviously done a shitton of research into it; More than any redditor can speculate. So it doesn't seem to me that bitcoin is going to die.

My question is how much power do these miners have over the market? With all the insane transaction fees over the past 6 months these miners must have accumulated massive amounts of wealth.

To further specify, it's in their best interest for bitcoin to be used a lot (higher validation fees) and bitcoin price to be high (mining bitcoin). So I'm wondering if it's out of the realm of possibility for them to reinject massive amounts of money back into the ecosystem to prevent their own losses.",1517524451,01/02/2018 22:34:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7umo3i/how_much_power_do_bitcoin_miners_have/,2

"What exactly ""invest only what you can afford to lose"" means?","Donald Trump’s Taj Mahal opened in April 1990 in Atlantic In July 1991, that casino filed for bankruptcy. He could not keep up with debts on two other Atlantic City casinos, and those two properties declared bankruptcy in 1992. A fourth property, the Plaza Hotel in New York, declared bankruptcy in 1992 after amassing debt.

Two more bankruptcies filed after 1992, totaling six. Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004, after accruing about $1.8 billion in debt. Trump Entertainment Resorts also declared bankruptcy in 2009, after being hit hard during the 2008 recession.

The man is now arguably the most powerful person alive.

So... What exactly ""invest only what you can afford to lose"" means? Unless you have cancer and $50,000 and treatment will cost you exactly $50,000 and needs to start tomorrow, I guess one could afford to lose everything, right?

A honest question about bitcoin and the environmental impact,"First Reddit post ever, super exciting, and quite a controversial one right away.

I have been following bitcoin for about half a year now. I have seen the mayor to the moon rise, and epic fall.
Even though I don't really feel the need to invest at this point, I am interested and might do so later, but there is something conflicting whit that in my mind.

Over the past few months I have been learning more about bitcoin and how it works, and here is the point. Bitcoin needs miners, to process the transactions. And with the growing popularity of bitcoin, so does the miner population grow. Right now all the miners in the world use more power than a small country does.

https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption

Don't get me wrong. I am not an environmentalist AT ALL. But in a time where we all seem to start realizing that we need to cut back on the production on co2, does it not bother anyone that this is a huge step in the wrong direction?

Again, I am NOT some environmentalist wanting to make a statement. But I am really curious as I see no one say anything about this at all. 

I also think cryptocurrency might be the future of digital banking. But ain't the way it happens now a huge step in the wrong direction when it comes to power consumption?",1517529033,01/02/2018 23:50:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7un6lb/a_honest_question_about_bitcoin_and_the/,0

What i think bitcoin is really about. Sometimes I need a reminder,"I was thinking about this last night since I was getting angry becasue I don't what's going on and crypto across the board has been in the red, bleeding out. 
I think we forget why bitcoin was created. After the 2008 after the worlds strongest economies collapsed from fraudulent and deceptive lending, governments were seizing accounts or trying to print their way out of it ,devaluing their currency all while using other peoples money of course. And the birth of bitcoin. I take satisfaction that no matter what, so long as I have my private keys, the government can't take it and I can use it as a means of trade or a store of wealth.  We now have a decentralized means of trade and barter that isn't controlled by any entity. Something that anybody can get into. Something that can have utility for anyone w/ a smartphone. That's why I'm here, that's what brings me to bitcoin.

Speculation is fun for me like it is for anybody else and I've still gained a lot more in the last years but it's not the be all end all. Maybe that part was easier for me to say since I've been since 200usd. However the last 2 months or so have been pretty maddening even for a seasoned hodler like myself.

[Korea update] Everyone pulling out,"Hi guys, just a little note. I personally think Koreans are driving down the market right now. Remember, these are 20s, 30s kids who invested their life saving(including loans) and hold on to their cell 24/7, acting irrationally to any news. The premium is MINUS, meaning the sell overwhelms the buys(remember it went to as high as +60%), and everyone is scared of Tether actually crashing, bringing the whole crypto to crash. 2~3 days ago, there were ""ITs a FUD!"", but now ""May it is true"" sentiment is spreading fast. They are  pulling out. I think India has nothing to do with this crash. The short term money are pulling out(I see tons of posts saying ""Im out"") and that is what's driving the market down right now.

"Japan and Korea controls the price, not US","Hey follow up to the below post. My parents are US citizens, and I live in Korea so this is no EGO thing, just the facts guys.
50% of crypto is traded in Japanese Yen, Korean won 6~7%. #2 is USD but, USD can be used anywere in the world where as Yen and Korean won is just mostly localized usage. 
Just the facts:
1. 4 Japanese were caught selling $6M USD worth BTC in Korea which was bought cheaper in Japan and changing to gold bar and flying back to Japan. These guys wer caught because of $6M gold bar, but it is prevalent thing in Korea. Korean market was the dumbasses of crypto, buying the same thing at 50% premium in December, early January. This coming to Korea in wallet and selling was seen everywhere, Singapore, HK, Japan.
2. The December Crave for crypto drove the price up to 20,000. During December Korean won took as high as 15% trading. IT IS Korea that spiked the price. That is a fact. 
3. Now what? Koreans do wake up at 4am. There is a saying: ""All crypto zombies in Korea wake up at 4am. It is the golden time, where trading volume hits the highest"". This is also a fact, not just making it up to comply with ""4am"". 
4. The Koreans are pulling out now just sell sell sell all the way, for no new money can be flown in due to regulation. They can, but it is almost impossible to open new account.
My estimation: the sell sell sell in Korea will be soon over, but the fear is at its highest due to Tether. ",1517533764,02/02/2018 01:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7unopc/japan_and_korea_controls_the_price_not_us/,34

Drip drip drip,"I have seen it before. The problem is that people are buying on the dip, which only prolongs the decline.

Best way to cash out? (serious--please help),"I might get some shit for this.  But serious question.  I'm trying to ready myself in case I decide to cash out.  I bought in through coinbase and transferred my funds to a Trezor.  

In the event that I do cash out is coinbase I reliable option?  I've read some things about people having issues getting their funds off of there.  Has anyone shared this experience?

Are there better options available?  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

You never ‘quit’ bitcoin,"No one really ever quits crypto. People sell but don’t leave the scene. Regardless of what you sell, I guarantee you still check the price 5x a day.

Whilst you sit and worry about the drops, just think to yourself - $250 BILLION dollars has dropped from the market cap of crypto in the last few weeks, that money doesn’t just disappear. It’s sitting in people’s banks waiting to be reinvested to make some more money - all those who jumped into crypto because of FOMO will be back when we see green again.

All the people who’ve ‘cashed out’ are simply trying to stop their losses. As soon as the price starts rising again everyone will jump on the bandwagon of making quick cash and will start investing again. Don’t give in to the FUD.",1517537579,02/02/2018 02:12:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uo2g2/you_never_quit_bitcoin/,18

Elliot Wave and Bitcoin,"If Bitcoin follows an Elliott Wave pattern, the bottom price could be around $7,596.  That is if I applied the theory correctly. 

Recent Max = 20,042

Point A = 12,350

Wave A =   20,042 - 12,350 = 7,692

Wave C should extend 1.618 beyond Wave A

Wave C = Wave A*1.618 

Wave C = 7,692*1.618 = 12,445

Point C =  Max - Wave C

Point C =  20,042 - 12,445 = 7,596

The Night they Drove Old Crypto Down,"Trading cryptos my game and I bought on December 15  
Until a Korean minister came and said they would ban bitcoin again  
In the winter of ‘18 we were falling, profit barely alive   
By 2/1 most blockchain had fell, it’s a time I remember oh so well  &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;  

The night they drove old crypto down, and my blockfolio was sinking   
The night they drove old crypto down, sell alerts were ringing   
They went la la la la la la la la la la la la la

&amp;nbsp;

Back with my portfolio on binance you see, a bad feeling began to creep over me  
They said ""look, come see, Ripples back somewhere around .93""  
Now I don't mind a dip or two, and I don't care if I lose a buck or a few   
Ya take the earnings you need and invest the rest  
They should never have hard forked the very best

  &amp;nbsp;

The night they drove old crypto down, and my blockfolio was sinking  
The night they drove old crypto down, sell alerts were ringing  
They went la la la la la la la la la la la la la

&amp;nbsp;

Like the buyers before me, I would hold 'til the end  
And like the traders above me, who took a gambler’s stand  
It had just turned ’18, alts were all the rave, but FUD had laid us down in a grave  
You can’t raise a ‘chain back up when it’s in retreat

Wolf Of Wall Street Says Bitcoin Could Hit $50K Before Crashing,"Jordan Belfort, known colloquially as the “Wolf of Wall Street”, has yet again cast doubt on Bitcoin, this time in a video interview with entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David, posted on Bet-David’s Facebook Jan. 31.

[Belfort told](http://www.bitlex.win/2018/02/wolf-of-wall-street-says-bitcoin-could.html) Bet-David that he doesn’t believe Bitcoin (BTC) itself is a scam, referring to it as the creation of “financial anarchists”. He does think, however, that the way the cryptocurrency was built is a “perfect storm for manipulation”.

Belfort believes that the rising price of BTC can be attributed to wild speculation because of what he sees as improper use of the cryptocurrency:

&gt; “Something [BTC] was designed to be used as a currency, and it’s being used as an investment vehicle […] As a currency, Bitcoin is no more useful at $20,000 or $100.”",1517538267,02/02/2018 02:24:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uo4vp/wolf_of_wall_street_says_bitcoin_could_hit_50k/,0

Price Manipulation / Options,"All, I've been a bit taken back recently since the introduction of futures markets have been created with CME, CBOE, and soon to be NASDAQ. When considering that these futures markets are federally regulated yet the underlying bitcoin trading markets are not, it makes one look at the seemingly enormous opportunities for large players to manipulate this budding asset. Consider the following scenario:

Step 1: 

Wealthy investor requests a futures contract with CME or CBOE betting on the price increas over the period of said contract.

Step 2:

Wealthy investor purchases enough bitcoin to hit the futures contract. 

Step 3:

Wealthy investor cashes in futures contract for profit. 

Step 4: 

Wealthy investor requests a futures contract with CME or CBOE betting on the price decreasing over a certain period of time.

Step 5:

Wealthy investor then sells enough bitcoin to hit the futures contract price that he purchased. 

Step 6:

Wealthy investor cashes in futures contract for profit. 

The only saving grace that I see here is that supply determines value and there's only currently approximately 17,000,000 bitcoin. That's it! Eventually the common people will learn the benefits of bitcoin over fiat and purchase enough of these coins during the large manipulation that the elite are currently enjoying. That being said, to minimize the amount of potential manipulation in suggest taking the following steps until decentralized, open source exchanges are in full swing :

 1. Research ways to protect your btc. (hardware wallets, paper wallets, etc) 

 2. Purchase bitcoin from the current exchanges in accordance with your risk tolerance. 

 3. Immediately move purchases into addresses that you control and that are beyond the exchanges control / reach. 

The above steps are, in my opinion essential in preventing further manipulation. By doing so you not only create self sovereignty, but you also have access to any Forks that may occur in which said exchanges may not have given you (i.e. Coinbase).

Bitcoin in my opinion will be successful, it's up to us to decide when!",1517539177,02/02/2018 02:39:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uo85u/price_manipulation_options/,5

Clif High Prediction seems quite accurate,"NOTE: it can work a number of ways. As of this writing, we have passed our expected 13,880 USD/BTC price prediction two months ahead of its projected timing. It could be that the timing is off, in which case we tune the lexicon to increase its accuracy, and go on. It could be, that in spite of racing past this number far ahead of schedule, that the price of BTC will drop back to our 13,880 range during the timing suggested (before the 3rd week in February, 2018), and thus the data was accurate, and our assumptions about how it would be so were wrong. In either case, other numbers in that same set from which the 13,880 number was taken are to be examined for potential accuracy in their values, if not their timing. Other numbers continue to squeak through our processing and are within this set. Noting the ambiguity of timing, we need to look at the potential for prescient forecasting as a conditional statement such as below:
Modelspace has the price (given the few numbers we get through our processing) as heading out of the 13880's before the middle of February. This implies a 'range bound' period in which Bitcoin will bounce up and down after its 30%+ correction. The 'range bound' period will be another opportunity to develop 'strong hands'. If the data accretion patterns are correct, the range bound condition will continue through January, with mid to late February being the next 'break-out' period that will take the price for Bitcoin into solid 20,000+, and establishing a new trading range that will be lasting through into May. Then yet another 'consolidation' over the first part of  summer, leading into the mid-Summer (northern hemisphere) 'flight of wealth' into
Bitcoin forecast to push it beyond '40,000'. Without regard to the above, there are those instances when numbers come through as words, and such linguistics, while rare, have always been prescient in the past in this work. We have such an instance
now of a number associated with Bitcoin being expressed as 'one hundred thousand'. Note that this appears in late 2018. It is characterized by being within 'whispered awe', and 'shouted elation', and 'choked disbelief' supporting sets. These expression contexts provide some additional clues including some sets going to 'one hundred K parties', and '100k celebrations', and 'one hundred thousand line parties' and other language of a similar nature. These sets are also part of several major groups that are describing a 'greatly anticipated event (crossing the 100k line)' that will be treated as a global 'happening' very much like 'new years'. Other sets describe the language that will follow the 'crossing the line day', and the many many references to 'parties'. Some of these language sets include specific to the occasion 'dances', and 'music' along with other 'artistic renderings (of the moment)'. There are sets suggesting that 'large quantities' of 'where were you when we crossed the line?' videos, and blogs will
be created. Also of note is that a 'correction' is noted as bitcoin is near '64 thousand'. These sets are also forecasting a lot of chatter around the '64 thousand dollar question', and other puns, humorous set ups, and jokes. These accrue to modelspace ahead of the 'correction', and many of their 'authors' will be subsequently
be 'lambasted' and 'baited' and 'blamed' for the price drop. The '64 thousand' connections via the linguistics do not tell us on which side of that number we will encounter the correction. The data does promise a correction, albeit 'brief', that will be 'physically shocking', producing 'vomiting', and 'fainting'. Hmmm...yet another bitcoin move....in the 30%+ range, only now in numbers so large as to have jokes about 'bitcoin (price swings) making people puke'.",1517541650,02/02/2018 03:20:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uogyw/clif_high_prediction_seems_quite_accurate/,7

December 26th transaction still only seen by 15 peers?,"Hello. In mid December I found an old BTC wallet, but didn't really have any interest in holding any currency. I agreed to sell it to my friend and on December 26th initiated the transaction for approx. 0.03BTC.

The wallet was stored in MultiBit and so I just used the client to send it. At this point it's been over a month and the transaction still pending, we're wondering what's going on. Is it actually seen by 15 peers? Should I assume this didn't work and try importing the wallet elsewhere and initiating a new trade? Do we just have to wait it out?

I see that the sidebar says not to post any wallet info unless asked, so I'm going to keep that private unless otherwise instructed. If asked, I'll certainly share the wallet and transaction numbers.

We would appreciate any input. Thanks!",1517542309,02/02/2018 03:31:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uoj8w/december_26th_transaction_still_only_seen_by_15/,0

My experience with bitcoin,"I bought a bunch of btc back when they were 10 dollars a piece, I held on to them and made some more through developing web applications. 


When the price rose a few years later to the heady heights of about 150 dollars I sold most of them, I even sold one to my girlfriend. I didn't want to sell them all but at the time I had no choice for financial reasons, and I figured although I didn't have any at least my girlfriend did. 



How ever I did have one wallet that had 1.6 BTC stuck in it because I couldn't remember the password, I was not too concerned because I had made a healthy profit from my initial investment and had been able to clear all my debts. I had only spent 16 dollars on it after all!  


Over the following years with each bubble my girlfriend would say ""look how high the price is, I should sell"" each time I would say to her that ultimately it was up to her but if it was up to me I would not sell unless I had absolutely no choice. I couldn't help but feel a little jealous of her having a bitcoin when the price kept on rising as it did. 


Around the time bitcoin hit 20k I was having a spring clean and came across some old hard drives, I plugged them into the beast to see what was on them and low and behold I find the wallet with the 1.6btc on it. Well at this price point I felt like I had to try a bit harder than before to remember the password. 


Now although I knew I had forgotten the password I also knew that the password was derived from a page in a book. I considered contacting Dave but figured I would try myself first. I obtained a copy of the book, then I wrote a code that took every word in the page and wrote out a list of all the possible combinations to a text file. 


There were certain rules that help me keep the list fairly small such as - I knew the words would be in order as they are in the book but maybe I missed one or didn't start at the beginning of the page etc. 


After I ran the code it gave me a list of around 20 million passwords, I then copied the list but removed spaces,  then I copied both those lists and removed punctuation. Then I copied all four lists and made copies of them in lower case, and copies of them in upper case. 


So now I had 12 lists all with around 20 million passwords in each! I paid around 30 bucks for a decent piece of software specifically written to guess passwords from a list against a bitcoin wallet. The software was able to be accelerated using my graphics card and the CPU has 16 threads so it was able to guess around 7000-8000 passwords a second. 



I left the software running and took the dog for a walk to the pub and enjoyed a nice cold beer, when I got home low and behold there on my screen was the password. I could not believe it. That 16 dollars that I spent was worth 32k! (obviously right now it's more like 13-14k) So finally now I'm back in the 21 million club. I'm so excited and thanks to the various forks I also have some other coins too. 



I am holding for at least another few years, I might however sell off some of the forked coins and treat my girlfriend....",1517544993,02/02/2018 04:16:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uosa2/my_experience_with_bitcoin/,79

"Here is some investing advice that works great, but r/Bitcoin is a strong religion that hates good advice.","Funny that I have to even post this here. On any other investment forum no one would post this because it is standard investing practice and obvious to all investors.
 I posted this on another thread earlier.

""Say you bought ONE (so you own one BTC) at 17,000 for ease of the math and then the price starts dropping. So you finally decide at 10,000 to sell it. Now you own ZERO BTC and have 10,000 cash. So it keeps dropping and goes to 8000, then 7000, then 5000, where it stops, and the market hits the bottom. You see this and decide to buy in again at 5000. Now you have two BTC. Do you see what happened here?""

This what I do with my stock purchases on a regular basis, except for the fact that I would never wait for such a disastrous loss before implementing my stop loss. I don't worry if my stock (in a quality company) has some bad news and drops steadily for a time maybe even 20 or 50 percent, because my stop lost sold automatically when I was down only a few percent, maybe a few hundred dollars, since that will be the limit of my losses. I just use the cash waiting in the account when the smoke clears and re-buy at a very nice discount and I end up holding even more of the company than I did before.

I think there is some mass panic created by literally one guy on Twitter,"I am talking about bitfinexed. He can literally bring the market dowb because people love drama. We currently have no facts. If they do exit scam which I think is unlikely then we can panic.


Please convince me this line of reasoning is wrong:  


1) you buy BTC with fiat you deposit on coinbase.  
2) you transfer to bittrex, pani  and sell your BTC to USDT because the market goes down. Bittrex owns USDT they bought with dollars from Tether. They don't have enough becauseany people panic so they need to print more and keep the price peg.  
3) you literally never bought USDT with fiat but that doesn't matter at all.  


please convince me there is another way to peg this without increasing supply and that supply increase is bad/suspicious when there are big market movements.

I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.

Bitcoin nowadays!,"It was preciously a time back then when people casually used to trade bitcoins as a factor of small payments, such as small productivity tradings. And barely anyone paid attention to it. Apparently rest of the other cryptocurrencies were never to be pulled off as an alternative of some sort. But as its casualties kept going down and down, people started knowing it in significant. So the other currencies have been put in to the gap to slide off.
What it as a conclusion stands for, is that Beginners to mine, or trade, straight right off to bitcoin would be nowhere near to even touch
 its bare minimums. I would recommend to start off with relatively new ones as an initial trial.",1517552294,02/02/2018 06:18:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7upes5/bitcoin_nowadays/,1

Some hard facts,"The following statements are all true:

1. Bitcoin's value is determined largely by speculation.

2. Speculation essentially creates fake demand. When the bull market ends, the demand evaporates and the price plummets until it reflects the natural level of demand.

3. There is no reason to believe that bitcoin is not in such a bubble right now.

Let's talk recent FUD,"Reasons for this DIP: India &amp; Bitfinx/Tether

DeFUDing India: Initial reports misrepresented what minister of finance said about crypto, claiming it was illegal and would be eliminated. The news spread like a wild fire on twitter. Hours later people translated [the actual speech](https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-bitcoin-prices-drop-as-media-misinterprets-govts-regulation-speech
) and it turned out to be ""eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in criminal use cases."" Infact, Indian crypto users [got tax notices](https://steemkr.com/bitcoin/@abhin/indian-crypto-traders-get-tax-notices-as-trading-hits-usd3-5bn-asked-to-pay-tax-on-captial-gains-of-bitcoin-and-india-bitcoin) two weeks ago indicating India's plan to tax and regulate the crypto space.

DeFUDing Tether: There is fear that tether has no usd to back it's 2.3 billion coins in circulation and there is evidence that suggests this may be the case. However there is no way to know anytime soon. All crypto currencies besides tether are essentially not backed by any assets and rely on customer demand to establish a price. Crypto price depends on several factors like useful functionality, popularity and future prospects. Tether is very useful because it allows users to easily transfer fiat (substitute) between exchanges without having to pay for wire transfers and wait several days. It's also very popular because of this. Even if there was no FIAT in the bank (their [pre audit](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf) in september had nearly half a billion in 3 banks) the crypto market could still valuate tether as worth $1 USD sans fiat and it would be valid under their Terms of Service and not necessarily against the law. Even if some agency was to invalidate tether (would be very hard) it would still not affect the market much because it's less than 1% of the entire market share. Some other things that relieve the FUDs: subpoena against tether came in December following the reported tether hack (as you would expect) not this week as fake news bloomberg reported, Bitfinx/Tether rep actually offered another bloomberg reporter to look at all their accounts in multiple banks if they sign a non disclosure, however the reported declined but reported this fact. Additionally, respected whaleclub.io member [claims he has seen proof](https://twitter.com/flibbr/status/958273166320730112) of Tether's fiat filled bank accounts and invites any non believers to come talk to him in whale club team chat. 

Based on the way we stayed at 10k for a long time despite weeks of fud and because of recent Soros revelations of bitcoin being used for government corruption nest eggs I am guessing that BTC will bounce back fairly well after the panic settles a bit.",1517555962,02/02/2018 07:19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7upoqe/lets_talk_recent_fud/,0

[From Korea] Bitcoin to bottom soon,"The selloff in Korea has led -8~9% DISCOUNT in the Korean market for BTC. Remember, it was +60% just weeks ago. Why are they selling? -90% is pretty common in Korean account due to A:Drop in coin price B:Drop in premium, making A+B=-90%, a scene not seen anywhere in the world. A ton of posts saying they are getting out and taking what they have or they are going back to stock market. As I have said Koreans have reached their limit. Japanese pulling out(due to hacked exchange which lost million of XEM) because most investors are age 40+, and Korean reaching their limit is the reason for the crash today. My estimation, we have reached bottom. Those getting out have or will get out by this weekend. Come next week we will rebound to $10,000~$11,000. It is Japanese selling + panic   sell in Korea for the crash now. ",1517556613,02/02/2018 07:30:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7upqci/from_korea_bitcoin_to_bottom_soon/,9

One Dip. One Lesson. one less mistake for next time.,"Hi Hodler / Traders / Newbies.

I see so many people losing their shit on this dip. yes. it's viable. because its your money but, I have a suggestion.

A lesson I learnt in last dip. 

***TAKE OUT PROFITS*** While you can!
for your $100 whenever we are at ATHs or really doing well. accumulate / diverse some profits into other assets or else simply withdraw them.

Because at times like this, you wont be thinking of all outs and cashing outs then.
also, with as good as 30% of profits taken out. you can take more hits even if it keeps falling.

All the good luck.
All the good love for BTC.

I'm trying to see if there's a simple way I can calculate total network fees paid from a large list of transactions.

The only thing I've found is blockonomics - however, it seems like the only way to import previous transactions / addresses is by utilizing an xpub. This is an issue because I utilize bitcoin core for my wallet, and bitcoin core does not allow exporting of the xpub, even though it's an HD wallet (utilizes hardened derivation).

The CSV I can export from bitcoin core only shows me the total amount sent on each transaction (non-change output + fee).",1517561756,02/02/2018 08:55:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uq2or/calculating_total_fees_paid/,1

Beware of the FUD'ers on here,"I'm seeing the same accounts constantly repeating the same type of FUD on nearly every thread, they aren't using any logic in their posts and aren't even replying to the people who call them out. This looks very cordinated, I'm not sure what to think but it's very obvious, they come in the same type of waves ever since the china FUD over 4 months ago. I'm pretty sure anyone else who been here longer than that picks up on this pretty quick but to people who only been here weeks, they are affected by it. 

Just curious what others think of this, people going out of their way this hard to spread fear into others, that has to mean something.  It would be one thing if they were being honest and are trying to help with good advice but that's clearly not the case, they are here for one reason only.

Iam indian and india is not banning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at all,"The finance minister of india just wanted to say that he want to stop the corruption happening with the use of cryptocurrencies.
And even if he states that  India is banning bitcoin still it wouldn't happen because our Indian party called BJP always gives fake promise and never ever implies what they tell.
For eg : our prime minister Narendra Modi promised to give every citizen of India 1500000 Rs 
Equals like 30000$ after getting the black money , but he failed to do that.
So there is no way that bitcoin would be banned india.
And even if bitcoin is banned in India there are only few exchanges in India which won't even effect the prices of bitcoin too much.
The price is only declining because of constant panic sell by the whole world.
India is not the world. Don't panic sell !
And crypto hatters can comment shit I don't give a fuck !

My main reason: easily comparing the max supply growth - I originally had a spreadsheet for that.

Since then I implemented some features I havent seen on other apps like binance or nano s filter or shortkey support. 

I also wanted more an application feeling than a site. So charts appear in expandable rows.

Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes,"Bitcoin has spectacularly 'died' several times

📉 - 94% June-November 2011 from $32 to $2 because of MtGox hack

📉 - 36% June 2012 from $7 to $4 Linod hack

📉 - 79% April 2013 from $266 to $54. MTGox stopped trading

📉 - 87% from $1166 to $170 November 2013 to January 2015

📉 - 49% Feb 2014 MTGox tanks

📉 - 40% September 2017 from $5000 to $2972 China ban

📉 - 55% January 2018 Bitcoin ban FUD. from $19000 to 8500

I've held through all the crashes. Who's laughing now? Not the panic sellers.

Market is all about moving money from impatient to the patient. You see crash, I see opportunity.

You - OMG Bitcoin is crashing, I gotta sell!

Me - OMG Bitcoin is criminally undervalued, I gotta buy!

N.B. Word to the wise for new investors. What I've learned over 7 years is that whenever it crashes spectacularly, the bounce is twice as impactful and record-setting. I can't predict the bottom but I can assure you that it WILL hit 19k and go further beyond, as hard as it may be for a lot of folks to believe right at this moment if you haven't been through it before.

When Bitcoin was at ATH little over a month ago, people were saying, 'it's too pricey now, I can't buy'.

Well, here's your chance at almost 60% discount!

With growing main net adoption of LN, Bitcoin underlying value is greater than it was when it was valued 19k.",1517564902,02/02/2018 09:48:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/,3476

Heavy price manipulation is ongoing on bitfinex using hidden orders,"Currently on bitfinex since around 4:15 am berlin time, there's someone buying alot of btc and blocking the price rise/fall at certain moments.

The example is here:

1. https://i.imgur.com/9GhsfXf.gif

2. https://i.imgur.com/SZujQMP.gifv (check highs ""H""). 1m interval

3. Breakout (14:00 berlin time) wall moving from 8510 to 8550: https://i.imgur.com/WbX0tds.gif



Thie first example shows clear blocking of rise using hidden order. The hidden order wall is moved at frequency of few minutes and the price is slightly modified by few dollars (to not make it look obvious). Before this, the wall was at around 8520. Even the shoots of 100-200 btcs are not moving the wall slightly, which just proves how many btcs are there ;)

Some whale bought around 40-80k  btcs since night and this is still ongoing.  The buying took primary place between 9000-8300. This is my estimation, it can be less/more.
The price is blocked using 2 channels, one hidden buy order and one hidden sell order. There are fake bounces as well.

Keep watching bitfinex order book for more ;))
This is being done all the time during this crash.

Retrospect - What has Bitcoin actually achieved in 7 years? Could it ever really change the world?,"Long-ish post, bear with me. I'll try not to but do apologize in advance if I allow my fervour to disintegrate the post into an incoherent rant.

I'm as optimistic(within reason) a Bitcoin bull as you're ever likely to come across. My conviction that Bitcoin will rise beyond previous record highs copped a fair bit of flak, not all of which could simply be imputed to FUDdly bears and Bcash/altcoin shill-mongers.

I had a heated discussion with the other half couple of days ago, who remains highly skeptical of Bitcoin. Not that she doesn't believe in the ideals or the technology. As I come to increasingly realize myself, she believes Bitcoin has been reduced to a fiat-profiteering speculative asset driven solely by capricious, continually manipulated investor sentiment.

The price has turned into such an obsession that every Bitcoin coverage is about either the fiat price rising or falling. Assets driven by speculation will eventually, inevitably run out of steam.

I've always believed that it's impossible that Bitcoin could just fizzle out into obscurity because of its seminal and transformative value proposition but, when you really think about it, it stands to reason that may not be the case when little real-world impact is effected by the technology.

Apart from spawning a handful of notional millionaires, although only Satoshi will ever be a Bitcoin millionaire, has Bitcoin really fundamentally changed anything?

What do you think it would take to drive home the ideals and make it resonate with a wider audience? How/when will Bitcoin achieve what it set out to do, rather than be a speculative asset? Is it quixotic to believe that it ever could? Is the fiat propaganda machine too much of a juggernaut to be usurped? Bring on the ideas! Keep it constructive.

My two penn'orth is we're at fault here for fostering a culture which prizes short-term price appreciation over long-term, real-world social impact. This has spilled over into altcoins, which after all are largely Bitcoin clones, engendering blinkered tribalism, rife with constant mudslinging and gasconade over market cap and CMC ranking.

Bitcoin has only ever attracted mainstream coverage for its fiat price, no other reason. Instead of using the exposure, dare I say begrudgingly, afforded by the price to dispel its erstwhile, still lingering stigmata and promote its revolutionary fundamentals to a wider audience, we've all fallen into a trance-like fixation over its price and allowed this descent into a speculative mania. An irresponsible and ungrateful betrayal of the original idea.

Bitcoin is backed by nothing, they like to quip. Fiat is not backed by anything either, we retort. But we're wrong. Fiat is backed by faith. Bitcoin is not yet backed by faith.

If we educated people on the fundamentals, being less vulnerable to market manipulators, they'd at once stop worrying about the price as triggering a network effect promoting fundamentals gradually nurtures impregnable faith, an unshakeable infrastructure to build upon.

The wider audience, no more inclined now than to dabble leerily, only perceives Bitcoin as a fiat-profiteering scheme, a ready means to mint new bank money, instead of the greatest economic innovation in the history of mankind with the power to restore every man's inalienable right to HIS OWN FRICKIN' MONEY!",1517706965,04/02/2018 01:16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v3mbz/retrospect_what_has_bitcoin_actually_achieved_in/,1

The debate about whether cryptocurrency is money or not,"The debate unleashed on cryptocurrencies continues. The government of the United States has been taking interesting steps in the legal aspect, since this invention has come to change schemes in the economic, social and political performance of the whole world. On the legality of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies, its detractors, have tried to create matrices of opinion on the use given to them, and it has been meant that it is a speculative bubble, a Ponzi pyramid, or simply a resource of criminals for the drug trade, arms and the payment of ransom kidnappings.

Earlier, an English study, refers to the size of the cryptocurrency market, still very small when compared to the global market of fiat currencies and the stock market and debt bonds, they are used in less volume for criminal purposes.

I think as a community we need a lobbyist...,"Hear me out.  Also, apologies if this has been discussed or already exists elsewhere.  Shoot me a link if it does.  I know generally lobbyists have a bad reputation, but they are paid to be proponents of whatever agenda they are hired to promote and influence the right people.  If we are going to enter the big leagues in terms of finance &amp; Geo politics, as we inevitably will, and will likely not be a welcome newcomer, we should control our own destiny as much as we can.  I think this is the way to do it.  There has been so much money made (and lost recently) in the space that we can and should build a mechanism to buy the best lobbyists for our cause at every level of global government.  Other ill informed people from threatened industries will very soon be defining our destiny.  We need to play their game to some extent.  I propose either a fund or coin to build capital and integrate a consensus mechanism within the community to define a direction and make decisions.

recover wallet.dat without password. possible?,"Edit

OK,. installing the bitcoin core and replacing the wallet.dat created by the new bitcoin core worked for me. 

at least i think it did. as i have 0 bitcoins. 

False alarm. go back to work folks. 

-----


As you might have guessed from the title, i'm one of the people who abandoned bitcoin while back. june of 2011 to be exact. I even uninstalled the bitcoin wallet and everything. except the appdata folder has the backup. 

so i've reinstalled the bitcoin wallet and tried to peek at what i had in there, and it won't let me restore from back up wallet without a password. 

I had the old appdata folder backed up and it's still intact from the june of 2011 

is there anything in that folder that will help me open my wallet from 2011? 

here's everything in that folder. https://imgur.com/MPbyJ7l",1517722341,04/02/2018 05:32:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v4ygv/recover_walletdat_without_password_possible/,0

"Bitcoin's price exponential growth does not make it an appealing currency, it renders it useless","If you have a currency whose long-term value yield much more than any other asset, why would you ever use it as a means of payment? Anybody who used Bitcoin to purchase products (e.g. a pizza) prior to late 2017 now regrets the overwhelmingly high price they paid, in retrospect. The fact that the motto at r/Bitcoin is to always ""HODL"" and never ""sell"" (i.e. use) no matter what says it all:  Bitcoin is not a coin at all but some odd, paradoxical speculation.

A solid currency should have no significant interest to be useable. If you celebrate whenever the price soars, you don't understand what's going on. You might think that you're waiting until Bitcoin takes over the world and makes you rich, but its market mechanism gives no reason to think this will ever happen; It will stay an extremely volatile asset and therefore will always be difficult to conduct commerce with.

When someone will manage to make a blockchain based coin that keeps a relatively stable value, at least in the short and medium term (preferably with a slight long-term inflation), it may replace the fiat money. But such a currency will not give any advantage to early adopters, by definition.",1517730693,04/02/2018 07:51:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v5ixn/bitcoins_price_exponential_growth_does_not_make/,6

What happens if the price of bitcoin can no longer sustain mining?,"Bitcoin is supposed to be a decentralized currency. You can own bitcoin without needing the support of any third party. The problem for me is that I find it very difficult to run a full node. The blockchain is huge, you need a powerful computer running 24/7 eating up bandwidth and electricity. My question is how plausible is it for the price to drop below a certain threshold and cause a cascading effect where large farms will no longer be able to make a profit and move to another coin. Assuming that for any reason centralized bitcoin farms die out, will I still be able to transact with other users? How tied is the mining process (making of new coins) to the transactions (exchanging coins you already have).",1517735519,04/02/2018 09:11:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v5ssl/what_happens_if_the_price_of_bitcoin_can_no/,2

The Escalation of Commitment,"If a government sends a thousand troops to fight a war and they all die, what should they do? Should they quit at a thousand lives, unsuccessful but with limited loss of life, or should they send another thousand troops to their deaths despite the fact they'll most likely be as unsuccessful as the first thousand troops?

The former option is logical, reducing the number of deaths, whilst the latter option gives the government pride, integrity, honor, resolve and improved public opinion even if the actual results are worse.

This is know as the [escalation of commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) or 'sunk cost fallacy', where you continue with a bad decision in the hope that your further investment will prove that your previous poor decisions were not in vain despite the fact that it is more likely that you will escalate the severity of the situation.

From Korea - Looking bright for BTC,"Hi guys. It is 7pm here in Korea, and we are seeing the last pack of short term money pull out today. Tons of posts for the past 3 days of leaving the crypto forever. 

I think we will recover BTC of 10,000 by Monday. I am confident. The short term panic of Korean short term money has left and we are seeing premium of 0% at this stage, making the BTC price where it should be. 

Tether, everyone keeps forgetting, if it were a scam, than the price should have plummetted to the pegged $1.0, but holding. It is not a scam and the price proves it. 

Will be back with the sentiment on BTC again. Once again, the short term Korean money that plunged the market over the few days have LEFT, and we are in the beginning of a big recovery. See you at $11,000 again, where it should belong at this time of year.",1517740649,04/02/2018 10:37:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v62wo/from_korea_looking_bright_for_btc/,175

Could you heat your room with antminer,"Could you heat your room with a bitcoin miner?
Because in the end hashing rate is not a form of energy, so the miner has to output all the used energy as heat.
And I know they are very loud, but if you only let it run while you're not home that should not be a problem.

So when it comes down to the question weather it is profitable, you not only get your earnings from mining but also get to keep the heat that was produced in the process which would save some additional money.
So in the end the miner schools just be an expensive heater.",1517742601,04/02/2018 11:10:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v66t5/could_you_heat_your_room_with_antminer/,24

"Can anyone help me recover my Armory balance, without armory?","I will attempt to be succinct.  I bought some bitcoin years ago and stored them in the armory software. Based on public addresses, it looks like the bitcoin is still in there. Few days ago, after a literally two week long download of the block chain, my armory loaded up just fine and the money was indeed in there. Something has gone wrong with the database since; based on DB logs it looks like my copy of the block chain was somehow corrupted. I’m really not looking forward to another two week download and re-sync in order to send those coins to a new Wallet.

TLDR; do I need to download the entire block chain again from bitcoin core, or is there some faster way to get these coins out of armory using my master private key?",1517745323,04/02/2018 11:55:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v6ch4/can_anyone_help_me_recover_my_armory_balance/,2

Why won’t Bitcoin appeal to the mass audience?,"- Regulation: Its decentralised nature makes it difficult to regulate. Governments and regulators may never come to like decentralised financial networks at all. A negative event, such as a price crash followed by public outcry, could trigger a regulatory crackdown.

- Intermediaries: Working without intermediaries is cherished by a core group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The mass audience, however, dislikes having no rights, no recourse, no guarantees, no legal coverage, nothing. They just want secure, reliable and hassle-free access to their money, and a help desk to call when they lose their password.

- Scalability: The Bitcoin network is currently clogged, and the current level of transaction fees (average $8 in November) makes it very unattractive for small payments.

- Volatility: while the value of 'ordinary' money is managed by the central bank, Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, and its value depends very much on demand which makes it inherently volatile.

- Energy use: in the case of Bitcoin, the price of taking out intermediaries is very high electricity consumption.

- Governance: Blockchain is great at rule enforcement, but does not provide at all for rule-setting. This lack of governance makes implementing innovations slow and painful. Moreover, power may get concentrated in the hands of a few (miners, in the case of Bitcoin).

The current Bitcoin dominance appears to be built on the idea that bitcoin will remain the cryptocurrency of choice forever. Indeed, cryptocurrency, like other internet services, are subject to 'network effects' and 'switching costs', creating a 'winner takes all'-dynamic.

However, with cryptocurrencies, these network effects and switching costs may be lower than thought. This is especially the case given Bitcoin’s open-source, forkable, clonable nature. Creating a clone or close substitute is easy. This means that Bitcoin may be scarce on its own blockchain, but its blockchain is in infinite supply.

If Bitcoin is 'digital gold', then forking and copy-pasting are successful forms of 'digital alchemy'.",1517746102,04/02/2018 12:08:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v6e83/why_wont_bitcoin_appeal_to_the_mass_audience/,1

Crypto Casuals,"I think it is time to define the term ""Crypto Casual"".

There are so many now in this community and in the Bitcoin market that the time has come to define some key characteristics.

- They spread FUD
- Post constantly about the price of BTC
- Usually they have only been invested in Bitcoin for a few months
- They listen to YouTube bitcoin/crypto ""experts"".
- Constantly make wild speculations while asserting them as truths.

These people are Bitcoin peasants, they believe Tai Lopez is a bitcoin expert and pay for his $600+ course. If YOU are a Crypto Casual do us all a favour and SELL, we don't need you and don't want you in our community.

“Success story”,"So after being told for years to buy into btc I finally did just after the price went to about 7k. Since then I hodled and hodled like everyone else.

I thought about pulling my initial investment when it hit 19k just for safety but didn’t (regretfully)

Anyways, about midway through this dip I figured I wanted to see a return no matter what because I had never pulled any out before.


Long story short I’m in school, unemployed, and I was able to completely pay off my car then after the price dropped more I bought back in with the excess and barely lost any btc. Could have just not pulled the entire initial but hey it worked out in the end.


Not as crazy as some of the others I read on here, but figured I’d share some light that btc has given me even in this current dip.",1517749968,04/02/2018 13:12:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v6na3/success_story/,6

Why Tether is not an issue,"The alleged conspiracy goes like this: 

1. They printed USDT out of air 
2. They bought BTC w it and pumped the price up. 
3. They sold some BTC back to cover their underlying USDT liability. 

So bad. They cheated. Everybody says. 

BUT - read the step 3 above. They sold BTC to get those dollars. Read it again - they sold those BTC.

So how can this impact BTC *again* ? It can't. They already sold BTC and created a downward pressure. 

How is this different to taking a loan from bank and buy BTC with it? Many people took a loan from bank and bit later they sold some BTC and repaid that loan. How is that different? 

Right - it is no different. And thus there is no need to panic about BTC exploding. 

Yes there is a moral hazard issue with Teth and it is good that they got a subpoena. Good job SEC. 

But this is no concern for viability of BTC. No concern. Maybe some negative sentiment because somebody cheated again. Yeah. Thats all. 

(EDIT - I forgot to add that if the conspiracy of unbacked Tether is true it means that Teth cheated everybody who was buying above 8k. Those buying above 8k basically gave these alleged Teth scammers real liquidity to sell their ""BTC financed by air"" for real dollars. So ultimately what happened you bought unbacked tether in exchange of your fiat if you are down on BTC and you should sue Teth if the wrongdoing is proven. 

BUT my point stays the same - it is likely already over. When they have those real dollars on balance sheet the downward pressure stops.).",1517758972,04/02/2018 15:42:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v7e78/why_tether_is_not_an_issue/,2

"Do you think the bitcoin markets will bounce off the $8,000 USD area? Or are you anticipating another leg down to test the $5,000 – $6,000 zone?","If the price is unable to recover and break back above the aforementioned trendlines, a retest of the recent low of approximately $8,000 is highly likely. Should $8,000 fail to hold, a further washout to test the 23.6% retracement area of approximately $5,000 – $6,000 may be likely, potentially validating a trendline stemming from the test of the $1,800 USD area during July 2017.

"Bluebird Botanicals, one of the world’s leading hemp &amp; CBD companies accepts BTC for 20% off all orders","Hello /Bitcoin community! We thought you might be interested in our company as a use case for Bitcoin (and in the future, other blockchain technologies besides currencies).

We currently accept BTC and one other coin as payments for orders on our website, with an automatic 20%-off being provided to customers who choose those options. When we implement the 20%-off incentive, our crypto-orders-per-day increase by about 1,000%. We will continue to incentivize our growing customer base to use bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in an effort to do our part in mainstreaming blockchain tech, and of course because we think it’s a solid investment too.

Our industry is classified as a “high risk” industry by American banks, and therefore we pay exorbitant processing fees in order to accept credit and debit cards on our website. +5% and a 10% 6-month rolling reserve, if we even get paid (a lot of high risk credit card processing companies are total scams and/or get shut down)! As a company and industry, we have a very serious incentive to distance ourselves as much as possible from banks and credit card companies.

Looking forward, we can read the writing on the wall. Blockchain technology is undoubtedly going to transform the way the world operates. We hope to continually showcase the potential of blockchain tech by using it for decentralized storage, accounting, quality control and supply management, corporate governance and contracts, payment processing, etc. Many of the employees at Bluebird are crypto enthusiasts, and we’re sincerely excited to incorporate blockchain tech into our operations over the coming years.

---

A little about us: we were founded in Boulder, Colorado in 2012 and were one of the very first companies to legally sell hemp derived CBD products nationwide (we currently ship to all US territories except for South Dakota, and about 35 other nations). Our hemp farm is in Pueblo, Colorado, and our manufacturing facilities and headquarters are in Louisville and Broomfield, CO. Last year we processed over $6.5M in transactions, and this year we’re expecting to do over $10M, with hopefully “parabolic” growth in the coming years! Our products are on shelves in over half the U.S. states, and we plan to land many more brick and mortar accounts this year. We will also incentivize our wholesale customers to pay with cryptocurrencies.

Our founder Brandon Beatty is also a co-founder of the Industrial Hemp Research Foundation (a 501c3 non-profit geared towards advancing hemp research), a board member of the US Hemp Roundtable (a grasstops lobbying organization), an advisor to the National Hemp Association (an industry/trade association), and an investor in The Hemp Connoisseur magazine. We’re also members of the Colorado Hemp Roundtable (a local legislative group) and the ASTM D37 Committee on Cannabis (an international organization that has roots dating back to the late 1800’s).

Just A Question About Price Vs. Complexity. If Someone Has Time To Answer It For Me,"Sorry If this is a simple question with a simple answer but I couldn't  find an answer to this anywhere.

So, The whole time bitcoin was on the rise I kept hearing that the complexity of the hash calculations (IDK if this is the right term. Whatever your gpu is doing for money) was rising. Which I just assumed had something to do with price.

So my questions are; Is bitcoin price tied to complexity? And if so, are the calculations to mine bitcoin easier, or less complex, now that the bottom fell out?

Offering BTC for any video or eyewitness account of the P2P Financial Systems 2015 conference,"Hello folks!

We’re looking for a video, audio recording, or eyewitness account of the relevant section of the P2P Financial Systems 2015 conference. Some of you folks here at /r/Bitcoin are likely to have attended.

A friend and I have been doing some research into the identity/ies of ""Nicolas van Saberhagen"" (the creator of a major cryptocurrency protocol, CryptoNote), and we've found some pretty good leads (and some very good guesses.)

I found a discussion of this event - P2P Financial Systems Workshop 2015 - where Nicolas van Saberhagen [promised to show up](https://cryptonote.org/news/2015/1/23/nicolas-van-saberhagen-to-take-a-stand-at-p2p-financial-systems-workshop), then spoke only over a skype call with a voice changer. Apparently, nobody could understand what he was saying.

[As a result of this (and the fact that ol' Nick was a scammer), half the room walked out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=658884.msg10993521#msg10993521).

Problem is, the only record of this occurring consists of eyewitness accounts from people who were there, as well as a single photo in the Bitcointalk thread. There appears to be video of a speech by Andreas Antonopoulos, but not the full conference.

Did anyone here attend the event and record it, or know of anyone who did? Or, even an account of it from someone who was there would be useful.

We will offer 0.01BTC for a video of the proper section of this conference, 0.004BTC for audio, and 0.002 BTC for a provable eyewitness account of what happened.

The ammount I want to buy is 1 Bitcoin. I will be using 3 different credit cards (My 2 brothers and I) will be splitting the cost. 


Also, another question, is there any pros/cons to buy from an ATM? And how do I put the bitcoins that I bought from the ATM on my hardware wallet? How do I make sure they safely got there? How do I make sure the ATM actually gives me bitcoin, and not just take my money?

Which bank will be the first to fully adopt bitcoin? It would solve all of the scalability issues,"So think of keeping most of your bitcoin in an account with a private key that you control. Every day or every week you transfer a small amount of bitcoin from your savings account to your bank account to pay for your living expenses. Since your bank account is centrally controlled you do not have any of the scaling issues. Your bitcoin is never converted into some other currency, you simply just use bitcoin all the time. If some bank adopts this they could be market leaders. Why is there no bank like this right now? Wouldn't this put an end to the scaling debate?

"Help! Family member forgot wallet password, we can only find keys, no wallet... what next?","I sent .1 bitcoin to my bro a few years ago, who has since passed away.  Doing a search, I found 2 bitcoin wallet key's with 2 different dates, in the computer. But no wallet.dat file...

It's been so long since I had QT wallet, and I don't have space to download it.  But this is what was used a few years ago.  Things have changed and there's so many wallets available today.

1.  What wallets can be used which are compatible?
2.  Does the wallet.dat file need to be there or is it recoverable with just the key file?   

  A.one or two files are required?
  B.one could be a newer version of the other

Is CoinBase OK to buy your first bitcoin trough?,"Hello,

(1) I've been following bitcoin markets and reddit now for half a year and finally decided that I wanna buy some. Ive read all the coinbase fiasco in the last couple of months but it seems the easiest place to buy it from. Is it safe and optimal to buy from them?

(2) I also thought about setting up my wallet trough them. Is this fine too?

(3) For cold storage, is it fine to just write the private key down to paper, put it in a safe and call it good? Any extra measures I need to take?


I know all of these things have been asked a million times probally, but for my peace of mind, I would like these to be clarified. thanks for helping a noobie out &lt;3",1517772980,04/02/2018 19:36:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v8you/is_coinbase_ok_to_buy_your_first_bitcoin_trough/,0

Factors that affect Bitcoin price,"#1 SUPPLY AND DEMAND - We all know that bitcoin has a limited supply therefore it price differs depending on the supply and demand. High demand while supply is low can make the bitcoin price go up.

#2 THE GOVERNMENTS - We have all witnessed that everytime a government implements new regulation regarding on cryptocurrencies, it has a big impact on bitcoin price. For example a government restricts the use of cryptocurrencies in its country.

#3 MEDIA - This is one of the cause of change of bitcoin price. In this section, we can see different type of news, the positive and negative. This also includes fake news and celebrities and known persons getting involve in cryptocurrencies.
Positive news - such as hype on bitcoin
Negative news - such as hacks that cause panics

#4 WHALES - This are the people that holds a big amount of bitcoin. It have a big impact on bitcoin price once these whales decided to sale or buy at the same time. So it is something like market manipulation.

#5 BITCOIN TECHNOLOGY - This affects bitcoin base on its stability. Right now, we are facing some declines because of many users loses interests to bitcoin due to slow transactions and bigger fees which is not effective in small transactions.

There are more factors out there that affect bitcoin price but for me, these are the common factors. ",1517773688,04/02/2018 19:48:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v91r5/factors_that_affect_bitcoin_price/,0

TL;DR version (and the only version): if you truly believe BTC will subvert fiat currency, it is futile to care about how many dollars you can get for your BTC. By valuing your BTC against the dollar, you constantly reinforce the dominance that fiat has over your BTC: X amount of BTC will get my Y amount of dollars to buy Z amount of goods/services. The nature of anonymity on the blockchain makes it impossible to quantify which transactions are fiat trades vs actual exchanges for goods/services, so your main objective should instead be focusing on how many businesses/people/entities adopt BTC to form a liquid exchange-based economy around it.",1517779865,04/02/2018 21:31:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v9rlc/the_hypocrisy_of_caring_about_btcusd_exchange/,7

"If BTC turns out to be a flight to safety when stocks drop take notice, especially after Gold did not rise.","It is common knowledge that when the markets drop special metals rise. Last week there were several bad days on the market but Gold and Silver went down, this is not common!

If BTC starts to rise with a stronger market drop, it might be seen (or it might actually be) a flight to safety and then you have it rise in an uncontrolled fashion as the market is certainly do for a correction. 

There are always unknowns out there when it comes to trading. Somethings can sends things tanking and others can send things to the moon.

One other point. Real estate is already at its peak, the overseas markets are almost all in a giant bubble, the options are limited where big money can park money and see big gains.

"Why Bitcoin wont die, no matter how bad they want it dead","Central banks, governments and the mainstream media all want Bitcoin to die.

And thats exactly why it wont.

If you look at Brexit, Trump, etc, you see a growing trend.  If you read the approval ratings for the media, you get the same thing:

The people want a voice, they want to govern themselves and they want control over their lives and their wealth.

The more they bash Bitcoin, the more they increase its popularity.

And they cant kill it.  Decentralized, it will exist regardless of what they do.  Thats power.  They cant print a trillion more of it.  They cant spy on it or manipulate it as easily.  

Its going to challenge how we define money and the role of banks and governments when it comes to personal wealth.

I cant wait for the day cryptos become bigger than fiat.  It will be monumental.

Now, Sina reports, Chinese government plans to mitigate that by banning domestic and foreign “virtual currency exchange websites.”",1517788346,04/02/2018 23:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vaoy2/with_china_tightening_regulations_cryptorelated/,3

Equity Markets vs. Cryptocurrency Markets: Weekly Review,"**Equity markets sell-off**

Global [equity market](http://www.bitlex.win/2018/02/equity-markets-vs-cryptocurrency.html) were hammered last week across the board as inflation fears and concern over higher interest rates intensified with bond yield rise. Each of the seven indices tracked below was down for the week (January 29 – February 4).

In the U.S., the S&amp;P 500 Index fell by 3.9% for the week to close at 2,762. That’s the largest one-week decline in two years. Nevertheless, given its strong start to the New Year, the S&amp;P remains up by 3.3% year-to-date.

Update: I'm not advocating for buying crypto with credit. I personally think it's a bad idea to do that, and completely side with the banks. I understand how credit works. I wouldn't loan someone money so they can invest in an incredibly volatile market either. Simply offering up a what-if scenario.

Slowly but surely the people I told about bitcoin a few years ago are hitting me up and asking me how to buy.,"This has been a long time thing. I know people are trying to say it's a bubble or something but it's not a bubble unless we make it that way. We deemed gold valuable a long time ago even though it's a rock. Some penguin use rocks to attracted mates. I watched a YouTube video earlier on how some culture would just use giant rocks and trade by ownership of it. Bitcoin is a currency. The value is what we say it is and public adoption. We need to work together to improve it. Bitcoin can co exist with fiat money and I think it is welcomed to. Yeah the news and media have been trying to tie bitcoin to hackers and thieves and all the wicked things of the world but at least it's being talked about. As for us we know that a hammer can be used to build a house or to smash someone head it. The average person will use a hammer right. Bitcoin will need time for people to understand how revolutionary it is. It will happen though eventually. A lot of people are committed and have been commited for a very long time. We will watch the prices get manipulated by whales and what not but it'll survive because the strongest survives and I am confident in the fact bitcoin has more potential and backbone than any other currency. We all have to do our part for it to succeed. ",1517801426,05/02/2018 03:30:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vbxu4/slowly_but_surely_the_people_i_told_about_bitcoin/,17

Remember why you came,"I remember the first time bitcoin rallied all the way up 1500 dollars and saw the headlines and even after the crash to 500 i still believed in its potential. 
However I didn’t buy, because I wasn’t able at the time and last year I joined the party and oh my I loved the rally and even sold my Tesla and Apple shares to gain a much higher position.
The market is down and frankly I don’t care for me the money is locked up and put away in this magical gold 2.0 system of which I know will rally once again (even if it takes 4 years).
The point I’m trying to make is give your investments time and try being frugal and minimalistic for the time being. 
Gains will come to those who are patient, I understand nobody likes losses, but selling your position for a lost is the equivalent of “no pain, no gain”. 
Think and remember the bigger picture that your gains will require time as the early adopters in the crypto scene also had to wait.",1517802381,05/02/2018 03:46:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vc1nn/remember_why_you_came/,8

BTC Market sentiment in Korea / Japan NOW,"Since we have touched the meaningful moving average, Korean sentiment is in the Driving Mode again. Premium is back. Tons have left who have invested early enough to still have + in their account and those with -80%+. It is polarized, the each end has left. The point is tons have left. 

I have lived in Japan so over the past couple of days, I have gone over the sentiment is Japan. The funny thing is that top bloggers have said to pull out continuously from January the 14th~29th. Japanese have gotten on the band wagon much earlier than Koreans, all exited starting BTC $13,000 and pulling it down to $11,000, making all upturn during that time  useless. They locked in their profits, and I remeber ""who are selling making the $13,000 such a big hurdle in BTC?"" -&gt; Japanese.

Koreans, pulled out the last couple of days. I think most Koreans pulled out in the $11,000~$9,000. 

I personally thought the bottom was $9,000. Korea is back in the up mode, Japan is looking on waiting to get back up after seeeing the rock bottom of this. Japanese are very prudent and safe, whereas Koreans are hot tempered, follow-the-flock and reckless(I am Korean. Lived in Japan for 3 years.)

A drop like this is bound for a V shaped recovery, which will happen very soon. Let's get out of 8,000 first. ",1517808698,05/02/2018 05:31:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vcno0/btc_market_sentiment_in_korea_japan_now/,15

"Yes, the drop is over","The low is over ,in my opinion. 
On Friday, February 2, at 1245 GMT. At that time, in the 7960 USD for Bitcoin, I estimate concluded all the consolidation started on December 17, 2017 from the record highs of 19891 USD. 

The structure of the fall is a plane, quite expanded, but flat at the end because it does not meet the minimum requirements to be considered a zig-zag, although having been such a weak plane it resembles in operational mode and in general bearish psychology a zig Zag. 

As a plan, and as a countertendency movement, it offered three corrective sections: Wave A from 19891 to 10700 USD (December 17 to 22, 2017); Wave B from 10700 to 17252 (December 22, 2017 to January 6, 2018); Wave C from 17252 to 7960 USD (January 6 to February 2, 2018). Wave C was a diagonal triangle or wedge, where subwave D overlaps subwave A and where each subwave was naturally deployed in three movements, so the wave C wave descended during these weeks, locked and lateral during most of the Time consumed. The internal dimensions of the plane are spectacular; Wave A (19891-10700) is practically equal to Wave C (17252-7960 USD); but in addition Wave B of the plane retreated 71% of Wave A, or 10 points more than necessary to not be a zigzag. 

What did this correction mean and what fragment of the Bitcoin story did it cut? In my interpretation, the whole of the 166.45-19891 USD path between January 14, 2015 and December 17, 2017, since none of the internal setbacks over the last three years of the market reached the magnitude or had the international drama offered by the lowered 19891-7960 USD. There was, in addition, a really strong additional ingredient that ""substantiated"" the decline: many US intermediary banks, in abusive and probably illegal use of their powers although nobody dares for now to dispute their positions in the courts of New York, they decided to block any payment in USD related to bitcoins, either from or to the United States, or from non-US points among themselves, even if the transferor and receiver were unobjectionable from the point of view of the preventive regulations of money laundering and of financing of terrorism. 


It is precisely that the fulfillment of the legislation in this sense, and even the over-compliance of the rules by the most serious bitcoin companies in the world has led the compliance teams and the leaders of the international banking to carry out a Last attempt to stop the evolution of Bitcoin and destroy their quotes.


The best that can be expected from the debit card at the time of the massive cancellation of the balance loading programs from positions originating in bitcoins. This offensive of the financial establishment, fearful that there is liberal market competition against the paper money system and banking created from secondary money at will, where the bank requires a license from the conformed state as well as a monopolistic model of exploitation and levying resources for depositors and consumers, has caused temporary damage in Bitcoin but has not managed to destroy it. 

Technically, to confirm the proposed content, the following resistances are required in the next hours or brief days: 9231-9760-9900 USD. In this way, the bitcoin would begin, in a new version of 7960 USD on Friday, a monumental climb of medium and long as the logarithmic reach minimum of the lived in the last three years between 166.45 and 19891 USD, that is to say a whopping 119.50 times of increase, which added to the 7960 USD of 2/2/2018 will place the product further back towards December 2020 or January 2021 at the level of 951220 USD minimum. 

The projected three-year rise, 7960-951220 USD would constitute a Wave 3 of 3 supercycle, where the rise 166.45-19891 USD would have been Wave 1 of 3 and the rise 0.003-1163 USD of the years 2010-2013 the Great Wave 1 of supercycle.

Some things to remember during a fall in the price...,"I’ve been crypto for about 5 months, so I’m not a veteran by any means but I have seen a few pretty major dips. 

When the price falls a lot panic is a natural response, but as long as you have done the proper research and you truly believe in bitcoin you should be able to subside that panic relatively easily. If you have not done the research then start doing it right now.

Here are a few major things to remember:

- Bitcoin is secure.

Bitcoin is still the most secure network in the world. The price doesn’t change that. Government regulations don’t change that. Exchange hacks don’t change that. At this point there is very little that could change this fact.

- Bitcoin is valuable

Bitcoin is humanity’s first trustless currency without any central authority. This is valuable! It doesn’t matter that you can’t physically hold it. Anyone who claims that bitcoin has no value because it’s “not backed by anything” is someone who does not understand how this works. It is backed by mathematics. I personally trust math much more than any current centralized authority.

- Bitcoin is scarce

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. Guaranteed. When an asset is scarce and valuable the price goes up in the long run. Adoption of cryptocurrencies is looking more and more likely. As more and more people start using bitcoin the price will go up. This is also guaranteed due to supply and demand.

- Bitcoin will continue to be relevant

Bitcoin is not the AOL of crypto. It is the only blockchain that is working to solve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization. I repeat.... there is not one other blockchain any where near solving the scalability issues without making security and decentralization sacrifices!There is a lot of misinformation floating around regarding the scalability solutions currently in the works. With proper research you will find that there is a lot to be excited for when it comes to bitcoin scalability. Patience will continue to be important here. These solutions need to be flawless before a mainnet release.

"2018 - 2030: The grand battle between bitcoin, precious metals and fiat currency","edit: I like that 30% of you are downvoting this post because you think bitcoin is going to the moon right this year, we'll never have a bear market ever again and the S-curve reigns supreme. Nope, governments were never going to make it that easy. Crypto will have its day in the sun, but that day is not today. 

***

I have seen things. Don't ask me how. My dreams can be cryptic.

The destruction of fiat has already begun in earnest, but we're only in the 1st inning. The next 10 years will be characterized by the destruction of the USD, and the rise of the Chinese yuan backed by gold.

Gold and crypto are the two twin pillars that will destroy fiat. Thanks to crypto we're looking at a resurfacing of a global consciousness and desire for a non-state backed currency, harkening back to the days of a gold-backed money supply. Throughout history, empires have risen and fallen. The strongest empire's currency has always been the choice reserve currency of that era, but as an empire grows complacent and the government officials decadent, so does the temptation to debase their currency. The privilege of being the reserve currency globally gives them a sunset period of 20-40 years as the inevitable decline happens. It all began when Nixon took the USD off the gold standard.

Both China and Russia has been quietly accumulating gold over the past 10 years, restricting exports and increasing imports of gold. China is the world's largest oil importer and is in the process of switching over from paying for oil in USD to yuan, and redeemable into gold. The ramifications are massive. Increasingly the world is turning back on the US and its currency.

China is clamping down on cryptocurrency heavily as it interferes with their grand plan: they plan to shock the world in 2019 by announcing that they will go back to a partial gold-backed standard. Not fully-backed due to constraints in monetary policy advised by their Chinese economists, but sufficiently so such that the world gains confidence in the yuan and central banks globally begin selling their USD in earnest from the current 60%+ weighting, demoting it to a 30%+ weighting in favour of yuan as it dawns on them the USD might have just lost its reserve currency status. In this chaos, as we see across all regime changes, central banks begin buying gold in earnest. Other countries respond by backing their currency with gold as well. China becomes the new global superpower.

Thanks to this, the gold price will move to all-time highs and start trading above $2k in 2019. This will see the beginning of a gold rush we've never seen before. Old and institutional money begins to pour into precious metals; new and speculative money pours into cryptos. Cryptos enter into a final blow-off-top a year later not unlike the 2000 tech top in 2020. Bitcoin crashes 70% from $1m to $300K. As this happens, the whole world goes all-in into gold and yuan as the new safe havens as this is simultaneously accompanied by a major sell-off across both equities and bond markets. The rout will not stop till the mid 2020s. Gold is now trading at $7k/oz and silver at $200/oz. In fact, gold, as is most asset classes, are no longer quoted in USD but yuan. Africa begins to wield significant influence in the global political arena with South Africa leading the charge, due to their massive gold holdings and gold mines.

The year is 2025. In the depths of a recession even more severe than the one we saw in 2009, the US government reveals they have been accumulating bitcoin since 2018, and have built a sizeable position of 500,000 BTC (equivalent to $250b with BTC trading at $500k). This sparks the re-birth of a new bitcoin bull run as the other central banks announces they too, now hold some BTC. Many central banks, especially the resource-poor countries who never saw the rebirth of gold coming, begin accumulating BTC as well. Many now fear Russia and China's dominance in the gold market. Despite gold being a decentralized store of wealth, the natural geographical distribution has made many other resource-poor countries bitter, and an unspoken alliance began taking shape as central banks secretly accumulate bitcoin. Countries begin to publicly denounce gold, even as gold ownership is quickly being transferred into the blockchain. Gold prices fall after entering a blow-off top in 2027.

Bitcoin begins to climb until it reaches a ""demand equilibrium"" with gold. By 2030, bitcoin is valued at $2m+ and represents a significant percentage of the global money supply and gold has fallen to $4k/oz. By the 2030s+ the world has transitioned to a fiat system that is completely transparent. All countries' reserves in both bitcoin and gold are publicly trackable on the blockchain. While fiat continues to live on, governments in the aftermath of the early 2020s recession now have learnt fiscal prudence and bond yields actually reflect market-priced default risk depending on a country's money supply vis a vis the value of the bitcoin and gold their central bank holds.

The economy never really recovered from the recession in the 2020s. Artificial intelligence had taken over most of the economy's jobs, and the wealth inequality continued to widen as more and more wealth accrued to owners of capital. The crash in the equity markets at the turn of the decade had also wiped out a generation's savings and therefore willingness to spend - the millennial investors who had gleefully piled into FAANGs as everyone turned euphoric into the last days of the stock market bubble. Deflation began to set in as the boomers started dying in record numbers, and consumer spending ground to a halt as nobody except the elites and the crypto-rich had any money to spend. By the late 2020s governments realized that a form of universal basic income was necessary or the economy would never recover, but a redistribution of wealth was not going to be possible. Countries came together and decided that a new UBI cryptocurrency would be created, in direct proportion to the amount of bitcoin and gold each country owned. With every single individual having their own unique identity stored on the blockchain, this was easy and transparent to implement. This ultimately paved the way for a global common cryptocurrency in 2030. Gold began to lose its shine.

By the mid 2030s, we entered a golden era for the human race as the wealth inequality came back down to levels unseen in the past 500 years. Productivity reached a new high, assisted by mature technologies that first appeared in the 2010s. Significant life extension, space exploration, nanotechnology, then the uploading of the human consciousness ...

In 2040, we encountered the Singularity.

Does anyone want to do us a favor and let us know what other wallets are available that we can switch to? They only feature that I really enjoy is the ability to have multiple wallets that I can separately watch and spend from using my own generated addresses.

Security-conscious new guy looking for advice please.,"Hello

I apologize if this info is available via the God-awful search function but essentially I’ve won some money on the superb Owl and one option is to cash out via Bitcoin. 

I’ve set up an online wallet at coinbase.com to receive the funds and am wondering how (if even possible) I might be able to take the BTC offline (USB stick memory drive?) so that I can be sure of it’s exactly physical location once it’s processed through the online wallet. 

Are there any additional concerns with this method? I plan to forget about it and wait it out for good or ill long term.

Startups and Bitcoins in United Arab Emirates,"United Arab Emirates
UAE appeared on the World political map in 1971 as a result of major geopolitical events, which fundamentally changed the balance of military powers in this region. It had been preceded by the United Kingdom army withdrawal from the Middle East and demonstrative navy maneuvers staged by Iranian militants near Tund Islands.

In the aftermath of those incidents official representatives of two emirates - Abu Dhabi and Dubai- reached an agreement to form political and military union, brining their administrative apparatuses under one state's umbrella. Soon after five smaller emirates - Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain - also signed this historic accord. In February 1972 the main legislative body of UAE 40-members Federal National Council was formed and sworn to action.

The Federal Supreme Council, which consists of seven emirs, is the most highly positioned executive organ of UAE. The federal president, which, according to the long-established tradition, must also be the emir of Abu Dhabi, is followed in the state's hierarchy by the prime minister, which, according to the same tradition, must be the Dubai's emir. Political parties are officially considered to be illegal in UAE and all medias are closely monitored by authorities. Sharia law is recognized to be an integral part of the UAE legal system.

During past several decades, in an attempt to end its economic over-reliance on oil industry, UAE government has converted the country into one of world's top tourist destinations. Today more than 10 million people visit emirates annually. UAE is widely recognized as the ground zero for luxurious and extravagant hotels, some of which present themselves real engineering marvels. Burj Khalifa and Palm Islands alone host more than 3 million tourists each year. Still, oil export constitutes almost eighty percents of UAE budgets revenues.

High-tech sector's role in emirates economy is almost negligible. At the same time, UAE high-income population coupled with modern telecommunication infrastructure provide a number of business opportunities to local founders. On the negative side, slowing economy with its continuing dependence of the oil extraction industry, added by excessive government's control over the local Internet and high administrative barriers to SME have significantly undermined growth potentials of local startup ecosystem.

The status of crypto-currencies in the United Arab Emirates is far from being resolutely set by its government. Almost immediately after the publication of the ""Regulatory Framework For Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems"" by UAE Central Bank in January 2017, which, in its section D.7.3. ""Provisions for Virtual Currencies"", firmly and unambiguously stated that ""all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited"", there was 180 degree turn made by one of the Bank's most distinguished representatives - his governor himself.

He said in interview to one of the local news agencies that ""these regulations do not cover virtual currency"" and these ""regulations do not apply to Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies"". It revealed a conflict of interests, which apparently exists inside of UAE government. We can assume that after the above mentioned report was made public some very important state official(s) privately demonstrated his (their) disapproval of this report, which then caused central bank's directors to denounce his official position on crypto.

However, judging by a reportage, which appeared in medias at the end of October 2017, UAE bank's head still keeps his negative attitude toward crypto-currencies, which he sharply criticized for the lack of supervision, claiming that ""it facilitates money laundering and terrorism financing"". The fact that this high-ranking bureaucrat has again openly expressed his anti-crypto views may have far reaching consequences. It also may signify the beginning of new stage of legislative crack-down on digital currencies in UAE.

Meanwhile, despite of the absence of legal persecution precedences, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remains legally risky in UAE.

Our Gurus aren’t immune to FUD.,"The more that ones identity and value in the world is connected to bitcoin, the harder the downturns hit.

We might think that they would be more calm and cool in these hard times, but they are far more exposed, not just financially, but in terms of investment of their sense of self, life’s work, etc.

This makes the bitcoin elite and celebrities more susceptible to rage quits, reactivity etc. 

It’s easier for the average investor to keep cool and ride downturns out.

Just some perspective to keep aware of.

Perhaps at times like this they need our perspective and reassurance more than we need theirs.

We’re still up over 7x from a year ago. That’s a huge win by any normal perspective.",1517824720,05/02/2018 09:58:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vdt1s/our_gurus_arent_immune_to_fud/,1

What is the blocksize policy?,"Considering Facebook has 2 billion active users. Considering these people are potential Bitcoin users. Considering it takes one bitcoin transaction to open a Lightning channel. Considering Bitcoin can handle 7 transactions per second. It would take 4.5 years with Bitcoin at 100% capacity for 1 billion users to open 1 lightning channel each. 

So we can safely conclude that it's inevitable that the blocksize will need to be increased at some point in time.

So what is the policy? One policy could be:

*We increase the blocksize as soon as the blocks are full.*

But that's not what we did. So what then? Are we expecting the blocks to get empty again through Segwit and Lightning? Then increase when they're full the second time?",1517827433,05/02/2018 10:43:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vdzm3/what_is_the_blocksize_policy/,0

Save bitcoin ? Let's give politicians some bitcoins :),"**Short post version:**

&amp;nbsp;

- use a service to send some btc to a politician phone number
- politician receives an SMS/email message that funds are available to claim
- enters verification code and can claim btc
- less laws against bitcoin

&amp;nbsp;

**Full version of post**

&amp;nbsp;

Bitcoin price is mostly dragged down by laws against it, against exchanges, etc.

If politicians would have some bitcoins, I doubt they would vote silly laws against it, maybe even support it.

**What if we send them some bitcoins ?** I think is worth a shot.

There are some effective services for this, I will mention one but feel free to recommend or use any other.

&amp;nbsp;

So for example using ByeBanks.com site you can quickly send BTC to any phone number or email, and there are some public gov sites that post phone numbers of senators and other politicians.

If we send some BTC to any of these email or phone numbers they would receive a message ...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; you received 0.10 bitcoin, you now have 2.30 total BTC (~ $18 000); go to byebanks.com/claim to claim them

&amp;nbsp;

Then from that url they verify email or phone number and they can withdraw or send to any other bitcoin address. 

I hope others find this ideea as interesting as I do, feel free to recommend any other solutions or reliable sources to get politicians phone numbers or email addresses. 

A good start can be googling this: **site:senate.gov ""@gmail.com""**

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: **we all need to discuss here and decide** if it's a good ideea or not, then take action. I don't expect just 1-2 to try it by themselves.",1517830214,05/02/2018 11:30:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ve6d2/save_bitcoin_lets_give_politicians_some_bitcoins/,0

South Korean Gov’t claims North Korea has hacked into S Korean Exchanges. Stealing tens of Millions of USD worth of Bitcoin.,"http://naver.me/5GSbJopU 

Sorry, the article is in Korean. But basically, the S Korean government just released news that N Korea has hacked into S Korean exchanges—such as Youbit. And has stolen Tens of Millions of Dollars worth of Bitcoin. And they’re using social media and email to carry out this hack.

Honestly, I find this situation somewhat shady... Especially given the fact that Youbit has recently claimed bankruptcy due to 17% of its assets being stolen. But what is even worse is that before becoming ‘Youbit’, the same company was known as ‘Yapizon’ and was ‘hacked into’ and had roughly 5 Million USD worth of Bitcoin stolen.",1517831369,05/02/2018 11:49:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ve98r/south_korean_govt_claims_north_korea_has_hacked/,19

PSA to all newbies: Dollar cost averaging is the most important thing,"Just a quick story about myself. I have been wanting to get into crypto for a very long time but never found the time to do proper research. It was only on xmas where I had a huge heartbreak and had to spend xmas alone that I decided to really get into it

So naturally I have a bunch of fiat on my bank account and wanted to just dump half of it into crypto straight away because lambo fomo.

I registered for Coinbase as it seemed like the best place for UK. The thing with coinbase is that its card transfer has a weekly limit, so instead of dumping £4k into bitcoin straight away when it was near ATH, I was limited to just £500 per week.

If I had dumped it all in one go, at this moment I would have around only half of my original investment. At the moment I'm down, but I'm only down about 25-30% of all the money that I've invested. The money that I've ""lost"" made me learn more about how the markets move that if I had just waited around for the optimal entry point. It actually makes me confident to hodl and buy more.

TL;DR - don't jump into crypto in one fell swoop, increase your position gradually instead.

I hope all the noobs and week hands are gone by now so we can talk about the tech instead of prices. Lightning Network is almost here and I dig Litpay. We should develop something similar.,"Also, everyone is crying ""but BTC cant be a currency its too volatile"" so why don't we make a plugin for payments where the price of a product is defined in USD and it's BTC price keeps floating? As soon as I make a purchase the payment platform sells the BTC and send USD to the merchant. If the merchant wants BTC he can select that option (""do not convert BTC to USD"") on his platform configuration. 

So we have lightning fast transactions and a payment system that ignores volatility. Now we need a Charlie Lee to come over and code the shit out of that. Any Charlie Lee's around here?

If investment value drops to 2,5k poor person looses 25% of his total holdings and it's really hard to cope with such loss of the investment. Poor person makes decision to save his remaining soldiers (MONEY) and pull them out of the battle.

Meanwhile for rich person total loss is just 2,5% and it's something fairly easy to cope with. He will wait through until market turns 180degree and he can sell into profits rather a loss. Rich person is not desperate for money and that's what is making him even more rich.

Bitcoin Price Falls to 80-Day Low; Robinood to Lead the Rescue?,"Despite the hopes of investors, February has not brought respite to the battered cryptocurrency markets, which continue to emit a crimson hue.

This morning, the Bitcoin price declined to $7,605 on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, reducing the value of the flagship cryptocurrency to an 80-day low. Bitcoin has not traded at this level since Nov. 17, when it was square in the middle of its parabolic fourth quarter-rally — and exactly one month away from hitting $19,891, its all-time high.

"Robinhood, Coinbase, and the movement forward","So recently you folks might have heard about Robinhood carrying Crypto prices. I've been using Robinhood for a while--I'm a stock trader as a second (or third) job, and my experience has been fantastic.

Coinbase fucked lots of casual bitcoin uses with their split from paypal. Right before a major crash, paypal stopped working and their support told purple that it was ""temporarily unavailable"". They lied to us, friends. It was permanently unavailable and they knew it.

Enter [Robinhood](http://www.robinhood.com) They're launching a slow, calculated rollout in a way that I, as a project manager, highly respect. Their business model, their growth plans, and their front-end are all calculated to be convenient, usable, and sustainable. The more people we get onboard, the faster people can move off of sub-par wallets like Coinbase.

[Check it out here.](http://www.robinhood.com) Bonus: stocks are at a low right now, if you feel like dropping some money into the market and supporting companies that support crypto technology (NVDA, GBTC, AMD, MSFT).",1517838937,05/02/2018 13:55:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vevrg/robinhood_coinbase_and_the_movement_forward/,5

I don't want to live in a world where bitcoin doesn't exist,"If you're wondering why I will buy this dip, despite the fact that it doesn't seem to want to end, it is because I don't want to live in a world where bitcoin does not exist.

We claim to have a free market in the United States, we claim to be able to raise ourselves up from our bootstraps, that we live by the virtues of individualism and freedom.

Well, bitcoin is the ""magnum opus"" of this philosophy, at least with respect to currency. If it doesn't work, the system is not worth saving. And since I think the system is worth saving, I'll go down swinging. I'd rather burn than live in a world where bitcoin does not exist.

Mind you, I'm being a bit hyperbolic, as I'm sure bitcoin will be fine in the long term (absolutely certain, because there are at least a few people who think the same way I do), but these dips are what get us to pay attention to why we're in this to begin with.

There are currently (February 5th, 2018) 1.2 MILLION people waiting to buy bitcoin on Robinhood, and the exchanges are still bottlenecking the number of users they're accepting. The price dip, by so many measures, doesn't make much sense at this point. We have fallen below the simple 200 day moving average, millions of people clawing to get into the ecosystem, CBOE, CME, possible ETFs on the horizon, so many other huge names talking about bitcoin and blockchain.

Frankly, those selling at this point are being idiotic. Remember, when there's blood in the streets, that's when you buy. You can't time the market, put in what you can afford to lose, understand why you're in the ecosystem, have a baseline of belief if you wish to have any semblance of success here, don't give up, buy LOW sell high (if at all).

I don't want to live in a world where things like bitcoin fall into obscurity. There are too many evil people in this world for the good people to let the few opportunities we get to push them out pass us by.

BUY THIS FUCKING DIP!",1517839078,05/02/2018 13:57:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vew8v/i_dont_want_to_live_in_a_world_where_bitcoin/,0
[Serious] What are some productive things we can do with our time rather than obsessing about the news/price?,"I see a lot of people here (myself included) becoming obsessed with the price, TA, speculating about the impact of news, etc. I've been hodling since early 2014, so this isn't my first rodeo. 

I haven't tracked the time I spend on things related to BTC and crypto, but I know it is a MAJOR part of my day.

Look, we all want BTC to moon, but obsessing/refreshing won't change a thing, other than turning us into crypto-Gollums 'my precious!' 

My feeling is that we're going to have some time on our hands while we wait for a recovery, so I'd like to find some creative outlets in the meantime. 

Here are some ideas

1. Read the Bitcoin whitepaper!
2. Take a course online - YouTube, MIT, etc. all have some great courses that you can take for free (economics, programming, foreign language, history, art, photography, etc)
3. Start an exercise regime. Walk, run, swim, lift weights, do yoga, tennis, basketball, golf, etc.
4. Read a classic novel (or just something you like)
5. Volunteer your time
6. De-clutter your home
7. Call your parents
8. Go to a MeetUp in your city
9. Start a journal
10. Cook a new recipe every day
11. Build something (coffee table, a website, birdhouse etc)
12. Try starting your own business/'side hustle'
13. Give your place a new coat of paint
14. Throw yourself into your work/classes
15. Research your family history

What would you add to this list?",1517839104,05/02/2018 13:58:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vewc3/serious_what_are_some_productive_things_we_can_do/,7
Looks like I'm done with Coinbase.,"Contrary to what most people believe here, I actually think Coinbase is a good exchange. I agree fees are a little high but it was super easy to use. 

After receiving notification yesterday that my credit card limit had been increased I thought ""Oh, cool. I'll jump on and make an easy few hundred dollars here and there."" It was not to be. Both of my linked credit cards, Capital One and Chase, are now blocking Coinbase transactions. I don't want to use bank transfers because it takes forever and it's hard to do any trading when you're waiting a week for your bitcoin.

Credit card was nice because everything was instant and made buying so easy. And for those who may say ""you shouldn't be buying bitcoin on credit cards anyway"", save your breath. I made money easily using credit cards. I could buy bitcoin one day, cash out that same evening, transfer the money to my bank and have it within 2 or 3 days and pay my credit card bill in full. Super easy!

My theory regarding this crash,"There were many rumours that the price of BTC in November + December was manipulated by Tether: Bitfinex issued a lot of Tether, that wasn't backed by the USD, and bought huge ammounts of BTC with it. 

Now that they are being watched very closely and that there is more and more pressure for a real audit/check-up they have started selling those BTC to have the needed ammount of USD to back USDT.

By doing this they have caused a chain reaction/panic selling on the market. ",1517840420,05/02/2018 14:20:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vf11i/my_theory_regarding_this_crash/,1

Crypto is yet another speculative mania - and that's not a bad thing,"Cryptocurrency is an obvious speculative mania, and throughout modern history there have been several. It's often a case of overexuberance of a new technology, like the internet in the late 1990s, or railroads in 1840s England. 

A lot of people decry the falling price of Bitcoin now, and try to counter it with facts about its fundamental nature, and how useful it is and will be. But a speculative mania and a useful new technology can exist at the same time, and while many people are getting burned now, it doesn't mean Bitcoin and cryptocurrency won't be around in the future. 

A list of the biggest speculative manias in modern history:

Tulipmania in Holland: 1630s (tulips are still a major industry in Holland today)

The South Sea Bubble: 1720 England (national debt consolidation and securitization, which is widespread today)

The Mississippi Company Bubble: 1720s Paris

Railroad Bubble: 1846 England (railroads were obviously mega-important for nearly a century)

Automotive stock bubble: 1920s USA

Internet Bubble: 1990s (no need to state the importance of the internet)

Bitcoin Mining,"I was reading about bitcoin mining and came across lot of websites and applications. I read reviews about those websites, and found most of them as fake. I still have some doubts regarding bitcoin mining. 

1. Is it mandatory to have a hardware for bitcoin mining along with some software ??

2. I found some application on my android device which says  it has mined 2845 Satoshis so far. I am not sure if it actually is true or a scam again.

The Bitcoin Paradox,"Someone explain this to me...happy to admit if I'm missing something.

**Assumption 1**: Bitcoin has value because of its use of a currency, given that it avoids middlemen and traditional barriers of exchange.

**Assumption 2**: Since supply is limited, Bitcoin will increase in value over time, with Demand continually increasing with adoption, population growth and economic prosperity.

- So Bitcoin essentially gains value when people use it as a currency, HOWEVER, Bitcoin also incentivizes people not to use it as a currency, since it is increasing in value over time (if you spend it, you lose the return you would gain by holding it).
- This means that people who hold Bitcoin want other people to spend the currency, but have no incentive to do so themselves. This creates an unsustainable system given that people either spend their currency and miss out on return or hold their currency and hope others miss out on the return.
- Therefore, the above assumptions CANNOT BOTH HOLD. At least one of them must be violated.
- Bitcoin either doesn't have value as a currency, in which case the value is either inflated or from some other source (though given its infrastructure for its use with transactions, this seems unlikely) OR Bitcoin will NOT increase in value over time, in which case...why are we hodling?",1517842166,05/02/2018 14:49:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vf7eq/the_bitcoin_paradox/,319

Ideal value of main chain's transaction fee when LN works as planned?,"Noob here. Interested in LN but I'm having a hard time understanding how high/low the transaction fee will end up on main chain, if everything goes according to plan with Lightning Network.

So if we imagine the ideal scenario where LN works as designed, with near-zero LN fees, what should be the ideal fee on the main chain for the system to work optimally. For example if fee on main chain is too low, there is less incentive for the user to use the LN as he need to pre-credit his LN account. If too high it prevents some low income users to use it.

So how do you see the ideal target value for the main chain's transaction fee?",1518006918,07/02/2018 12:35:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vvsby/ideal_value_of_main_chains_transaction_fee_when/,1

sooo about bitcoin. Am I wrong?,"I didn't buy bitcoin (yet), but follow my reasoning.

Blockchain will be bigger and bigger to keep track of all the payments etc. This is also implied in the mining. Bitcoin will never be a standalone currency because of the system of blockchain. Blockchain makes transactions harder and therefor more expensive. Therefor there is designed a LN; but...
isn't LN just an analogy with current money? This whole system is similar to the trust - money - system we have now...

Thus the reasoning about cryptocurrency being an alternative to money is absurd.. the solution thats brought up is a lightning network which is just creating the whole money system again.

So who is in control  of the LN system?

Am I wrong?

EDIT: for me it seems like blockchain is a nice technology to keep track of 'big' money. So it can be tracked when stolen etc. But for smaller things you kinda need 'money'. A trusts-based system. So blockchain are 'bank accounts'?",1518017324,07/02/2018 15:28:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vwu1g/sooo_about_bitcoin_am_i_wrong/,0

"MercuryApp.io updated! (cryptofolio app with exchange sync, AES encryption of your account and no registration)","**[mercuryapp.io](https://mercuryapp.io)**

I've updated MercuryApp.io with new features and bug fixes.

***
&amp;nbsp;

**Secure AES encryption**
&gt; Your locally stored portfolio data will now be encrypted with AES encryption from CryptoJS. This adds a layer of security to your device as the application will not work if you don't enter the secret key you used to encrypt your data. You can also opt-out in the future and use a standard secret key to encrypt your account and you won't need to enter anything.

&amp;nbsp;

**Updated position list view**
&gt; The new position list let's you view the current price, 24 hour price change in percent, your total value and the 24 hour value change. Additionally you're now able to sort the position list by name, price or total value.

&amp;nbsp;

**Latest coins**
&gt; The coins we've added lately are: ZenCash ($ZEN), Ambrosus ($AMB), Modum ($MOD), DigiByte ($DGB) and ZCash ($ZEC).

&amp;nbsp;

**Cash/FIAT position**
&gt; Add your current Cash/FIAT position manually if you hold any kind of FIAT on any account.

explanation about the fear of bitcoin,"IN ENGLISH

Having diner with some friends lately, I realized than quite a lot of people still have an approximate knowledges about cryptotocrrencies .
And more important, they do not realize what powerful democratic tool cryptos are, why it scares banks and governments so much .
They usually read only the titles of the news articles (which for some are really BS)
So I wrote the text below . It's in french and my english is not good enough to translate the humor in the text (to whoever can , feel free to translate it, It's open source  I don't claim any right on it :-) )). 

For the french, please copy and paste the text below everywhere you can (article comment , friends , social media etc .. ) , so the voices of cryptos is not silenced by a distorted press


IN FRENCH
Dinant récemment avec des amis j ai réalisé qu'un grand nombre de gens ont encore une connaissance parcellaire des cryptommonaies.
Et plus important ils n'ont pas conscience du formidable outil démocratique qu'elles représentent et de pourquoi elles font si peur aux banques et aux gouvernements .
Ils se contentent de lire les titres des articles de presse (dont certains sont des âneries )
Alors j ai écris le texte ci dessous . SVP copier coller ce texte partout où vous pouvez (commentaires, réseaux sociaux etc.. ) histoire que la voix des cryptomonnaies ne soit pas étouffée par une presse biaisée



============================ THE TEXT ========================================


Qui a peur du grand méchant bitcoin ?

C'est pas nous , c'est pas nous comme le dit la comptine .

Mais alors pourquoi cet acharnement sur les cryptomonnaies ?? En résumé , parce que ça marche .

Il faut se souvenir que le bitcoin, la première cryptomonnaie telle que nous les connaissons aujourd'hui, a été crée suite à la crise financière de 2008 
Elle offre une technologie que l'on appelle la blockchain qui permet d'enregistrer des transactions entre personnes ou société possédant une adresse bitcoin. 
Et ce, en toute transparence (car le registre des transactions est public) et de façon sure et permanente (du fait de la cryptographie utilisée ainsi que de la distribution du registre des transactions sur un grand nombre de serveur).
L'utilisation de cette technologie est libre de droit . 

Le but est avant tout de contrer les effets néfastes des toutes puissantes institutions financières dans nos démocraties et de libérer la population de son emprise en mettant à l'abri les fonds de la population sur un réseau indépendant.
Effets qui se sont confirmés pendant la crise grecque, avec les conséquences que l'on connaît sur la population grecque, ou encore en France quand on découvre que ce sont les banques qui choisissent qui aura le droit de se présenter ou non à certaines élections en accordant ou non les financements nécessaires. 

Et ce bitcoin,  qui au départ était moqué par les banques comme un phénomène de geek , permet aujourd'hui aux venezueliens de s'acheter de quoi survivre dans un pays sous pression économique des USA et du FMI .
Ils sont l'exemple même de ce qui dérange les banques et une partie de la classe politique, une population, voir un pays  que l'on ne peut contrôler via le compte bancaire .

Vous vous dites ce type, est un des ces parano conspirationnistes propagateur de fake news (si c’était vrai au moins je serais à la mode ;-) )

&lt;mode cynique on&gt;
Certes on nous dit qu'il n y aura plus de crises financières (ce qui est sans doute aussi vrai que le première guerre mondiale était la der de der , ou encore que le nuage de Tchernobyl ne traversait pas les frontières) .Bien sur,  on nous dit que les euros sur nos comptes ont une valeur réelle et correspondent à des richesses bien réelles, et ne sont pas simplement des chiffres ajouter par la BCE dans un tableau excel (et donc la peur du bank run n'est qu'un fantasme, le rachat des dettes pourries n'est pas une planche à billet déguisée et enfin les accords Bretton Woods ne sont qu'un tournoi de golf). 
&lt;/mode cynique off&gt; 

Mais réfléchissons un instant et posons nous les questions suivantes . 
- Dans nos pays dit développés, à quel point sommes nous dépendant des banques (la réponse est au dessus , merci de suivre;-) ) ?
- Pouvons nous vivre sans comptes bancaires (idem que pour la question précédente :-) ) ??
- Que se passerait-il si une nouvelle crise financière (comme une crise de la dette par exemple) se produisait (parfum sauce grec ou pas, sujet évoqué a Davos, mais vite étouffé )??
- Que se passerait il si une grande partie de la population désirait retirer son argent des banques ?? (ce bank-run qui à fait si peur justement pendant la crise grec, (au passage provoquée avec l'aide de Goldman Sachs aussi appelé la firme) .

Ou même plus simplement que se passerait-il si la population allait au delà des gros titres d'une presse économique dont les principaux annonceurs sont des banques et autres sociétés de gestions fonds,  et s’intéressait à un système financier où ils sont les seuls maîtres de leur fonds et décidaient d'y transférer une partie de leur argent.

Bien sur , intuitivement vous avez la réponse :
Cela serait une catastrophe pour les banques (et par effet domino, la classe politique) car elles se retrouveraient sans fonds sur lesquels vivre et spéculer (Vous aviez cru que votre argent restait sur vos comptes ?) . Et le gouvernement sans contrôle sur la population. Or dans le système financier actuel de l'argent dette, et sa perpétuel fuite en avant (he oui, la dette mondiale est de 233 000 milliards  $ soit 318% du PIB mondiale , he non, y a pas de fautes de frappes ), il faut en permanence ré-injecter de l'argent pour que ça marche (Charles Ponzi aurait du déposer un brevet :-) )

les banques prêtent (de plus en plus difficilement d'ailleurs, peut être la population a t elle compris qu'a crédit on aurait le diable ) et spéculent avec l'argent des dépôts (mais pas seulement , voir les accords Bâle III) .
Et les politiques empruntent aux banques pour financer leur campagnes et leur promesses politiques. 
Et les banques empruntent le pouvoir aux politiques pour favoriser (mais on dit réguler) le système financier .
Et après moi le déluge :-) , la boucle est bouclée . 

Maintenant mettez vous donc à la place de nos chers banquiers et politiques. Si vous saviez tout ça (car ils l'ont déjà compris d'où les réunions en coulisses de Davos au sujet des cryptomonnaies )  que choisiriez vous ?

D'un coté l'homologation d'un système de paiement et de stockage de valeur qui ressemble à l'étalon or (mais en plus rapide et plus facile à stocker) qui rendrait un réel contrôle à la population sur ses finances et ce faisant devoir repenser le système financier actuel au dépend de votre pouvoir ?

Ou choisiriez vous de tuer ce système en disant qu'il à la rage, et d'en tenir loin la population , afin de maintenir le système financier existant et le pouvoir qu'il vous donne ?

Nos institutionnels ont bien compris que les cryptomonnaies sont les pierres numériques d'une révolution sans violence qui ne demande rien d' autre qu'une prise de conscience de la population.
Le dormeur doit se réveiller

How would bitcoin handle taxation if adopted?,"Pretty much the title. I'm thinking if everyone started using bitcoin; wouldn't the anonymus and decentralized properties of the currency make it impossible to trace taxation back to a person? 
Obviusly we would still need taxes, (1.) But how would such a process look like? (2.) Would the bank still handle taxes?  

Im sorry if I seem confused, because i'm still trying to wrap my head around the process. And if any of you guys have straight up facts, please refer to your source aswell. :) Thanks!",1518024299,07/02/2018 17:24:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7vxphi/how_would_bitcoin_handle_taxation_if_adopted/,1

"Given China is banning bitcoin mining, why is bitcoin hashrate not falling?","As per news for now atleast 1+ month China is banning bitcoin mining and is guiding mining farms towards orderly exit. And we know China is home to a very large percentage of overall bitcoin mining operations (&amp; thus overall hashrate). If those mining farms are getting banned then why is bitcoin hashrate not falling?

Here are some link for articles about China banning bitcoin mining:

1) Jan 9th Financial times article: https://www.ft.com/content/adfe7858-f4f9-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00 Key excerpts: ""China is moving to wipe out its bitcoin mining industry following concerns of excessive electricity consumption and financial risk, in the latest sign of Beijing’s hostility to cryptocurrencies."" ""A multi-agency task force has instructed provincial governments to “actively guide” companies in their respective regions to exit the cryptocurrency mining industry, according to a document seen by the Financial Times""

I love bitcoin,"I have an emotional attachment to it. I don't care if goes down to zero dollars or $1,000,000. At first I was in it to make money and get rich. Now I'm in it for all the positive change it's going to bring to humanity. My dad's bank account ran out of money. Winter is especially hard this year. So he was billed almost twice as much for power. Auto bill-pay paid more than what's in his account. He had about $12 left. Guess what the bank did? The charged him $25. He had +12 now he's -13$. How is this not stealing in plain day light? How is this ethical or moral? Banks make billions and billions of dollars on people's money each year. Personal banking should be absolutely free. But no, they charge ""maintenance' fee. I don't even understand what's there to maintain at the bank. 


Every single bitcoin hodler here and throughout the world is my brothers and sisters. I love you all. Heck, I even love the people over at /r/btc and roger ver. All of them still have bitcoin despite how much try to pump bcash. Bring it in for a huge worldwide group-hug.

Is the Lightning Network just a mirage to make people think that all issues..,"... will be fixed?

From what I understand, it has way to be used:
1) The situation of everyone currently
- You open your own channel
- Do a transaction on the Bitcoin Blockchain to fund the channel
- The recipient to need to join your channel
- You do the transaction over the channel
- Do a second transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain so that the recipient get official the amont transferred.
So 2 full transactions plus a lot of steps to do 1 transaction, is it me or this is not a good deal?

2) You already have coins deposited to a central entity
- The recipient connect to that central entity (if they are not already connected)
- You send the amount through that central entity
- If the recipient dont plan to re-use this centra entity they do a full transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain to collect their coins
This scenario can be good .... if the LN becomes fully centralized and everyone is connected in some way to this central entity. But then.... is it not what Bitcoin is all against? ""But we can always go back to the original Blockchain"" What will happen with transactions in progress if this central entity goes down? This central entity can charge fees, can't they over charge if they centralized? LN is suppose to have almost unlimited scalability... but if it is centralized it will be limited by this central entity?",1518047187,07/02/2018 23:46:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w0kfv/is_the_lightning_network_just_a_mirage_to_make/,0

Cryptocurrency Investor Profile Research,"Hello,

I am a recent graduate of California State University, Northridge, and am currently involved with the Applied Social Psychology Lab at that institution. The reason for this post is that we are currently undertaking research to do with cryptocurrency investors. To date, there has been research concerning the market movement itself, but little to none has been done on the individuals currently investing. 

The present questionnaire concerns the personalities and tendencies of the average cryptocurrency investor. It takes approximately 5 minutes, and all information is kept confidential. You will not be asked any identifying questions such as your name or public wallet address. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the individuals investing in this market. 

I’ll be posting this in several sub-reddits, so if you see this posted elsewhere, please do not take it more than once. We thank you for your participation. Here is the link to questionnaire:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHW4KBng7_M&amp;feature=youtu.be

The lyrics goes like this:

Bitcoin has made me a useless creep/ I stare at the chart till my brains bleed/ This is the latest cocaine trip/ I spent the food money on an endless dip

Wanted to go bath in the sun/ In a Miami fancy hotel tub/ But now I'm asking money to my mom/ To pay my debt that's on the run

Hey, that chart has changed its way!/ Up to the moon here we go again/ I'll sell my clothes to become a God/ Bitcoin rocket, brand new start!

Hope you like it... Good trades everyone!

Going to College for Bitcoin,"Long story short, I have a background in computer engineering from now defunct ITT tech. Garbage.

I meet with my advisor next week and I need some guidance from you guys.

What would be the best roadmap for me to learn as much as I can about bitcoin development, coding and general knowledge in blockchain development? It is still early in its life yes, but I believe by the time I do two years of pre req classes that many universities will offer degrees related to cryptography/blockchain technology. 

As far as I can tell there are just crypto clubs around but no real straight forward educational pathways. Do any companies (blockstream, etc) offer scholarships to go to school and get involved in the development side? Any and all info will help.

Day trading: what am I doing wrong?,"I've been wanting to start day trading more. 

I've been trying to make very short term (&lt;10 min) buy low sell high, when I see the ask price is at least 1.5% higher than the ask price (commission is 0.5% each way). In theory I should be seeing at least 0.5% growth each time, but in practice I always seem to barely make 0.1% on average. Any advice?

1. Is it better/easier to day trade crypto-fiat or crypto-crypto?

2. What is a good percentage of account to work with for short term trades (while the rest is hedl)

3. What is a typical target gain for a single ""buy low sell high"" strategy?

4. What is a typical timeline for one of these events?

5. Do you always keep a bit of each crypto in order to take advantage of a rise/dip, and just keep the ratio in favor of the one that I think is going to rise?

6. Do you tend to actively look for small potential gains or just set pretty far off limit orders and take advantage of them if they happen to hit?

7. Say you see a pretty decent consistent dip, let's say 5% in 2 hours. There's bound to be a rise eventually, how do you take advantage?

8. Say you see a pretty decent consistent rise, let's say 5% in 2 hours. There's bound to be a dip eventually, how do you take advantage?

9. Any other scenarios that tends to be favorable to day traders?

10. I know whales manipulate the market and make money at the expense of those who fall for their shenanigans. How do I stay on the winning side?

"Well, I didn’t stay on long. I’m out","Hi bitcoiners.

Yesterday i thought i’d invest in bitcoin. I originally had the idea of sticking £1000 down, but someone told me to do 10 lots of £100. 

So i stuck £100 on at $£5600 , then as bitcoin grew, that turned to £300, then £500. It peaked at $£6200 and i thought it would go on to $£7000 or do something. Instead, it just stuck around the $£6000 area. 

No signs of either growing , it got frustrating to watch the charts as the coin stayed flat. I decided to sell at the next rise and keep my money. 

It’s just not worth the stress right now.",1518061498,08/02/2018 03:44:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w225z/well_i_didnt_stay_on_long_im_out/,0

Similarity between bitcoin and petrodollar,"Hey so I am looking to write an article on this topic and I wanted the mass opinions on this subject. I can't help but see a lot of resemblance to bitcoin being used as a de facto proxy to purchase altcoins on exchanges like bittrex and binance. I know that USDT and Tether we're ""suppose"" to be the workaround for this, but in reality, if we could use fiat currency directly instead of bitcoin then would that spell bad news for bitcoin?

To point out where I am seeing this connection I'll quote an article from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/072915/how-petrodollars-affect-us-dollar.asp) *""Since the most sought after commodity in the world--oil--is priced in U.S. dollars, the petrodollar helped elevated the greenback as the world's dominant currency. In fact, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) triennial survey, 87 percent of all foreign exchanges deals initiated in April 2013, involved the USD on one side. With this status, the U.S. dollar was able to enjoy, what some have asserted to be an ""exorbitant privilege"" of perpetually financing its current account deficit by issuing dollar denominated assets at very low rates of interest, as well as, becoming a global economic hegemony.""*

I am by no means new to crypto, but I am curious how well I understand bitcoin. I might be completely off on my observation.

Advice for investing in BTC and making portfolio grow as a student without a part-time job?,"Hey, I got into BTC about 3 months ago and one advice that stands out to me is to make small but consistent investments every week into BTC from your paycheck. However this isn't possible for me atm because I'm studying a difficult degree (med) where I'm basically studying most of the time and I honestly don't have the time to work for now

I did however save up $1500 exclusively for investing after a long time and took the subs advice to diversify your portfolio 

What would be the best way to continually make my portfolio grow when it's difficult to get an income stream? Should I get into mining, focus on short-term trading and re-invest profits into btc etc. What would be a good way that I may not be aware of?

Thank you

Furthermore, when all the fud was ""going on"", the loyal ones were busy in improving the btc network as the result of which the unconfirmed transactions are down to just 4k and btc network actively processing almost 40 tx per second. Hopefully we will just see improvement from now on.

Edit: 93 tx per second

Heavy Holders May Bust Bitcoin Bubble,"I think a lot more people should be concerned about whether the bubble is really about to bust. Bitcoin requires more buyers than sellers in order for the value to increase. When some of the heavy Bitcoin holders decide to sell off their huge number of coins, it will upset the balance between coins bought and coins sold, creating a huge drop in value that will be impossible to overcome. The heavy holders certainly have a price at which they will sell, perhaps $6500? Once it hits this number, they will flood the market with coins and a lot of people will be SOL. After the value falls $100 per coin, the same people that crashed the market can buy back right back in.

Be cautious of the inevitable fire sale that will bust the bubble and bring Bitcoin crashing down.

Why do you think so many average people seem so emotionally involved with Bitcoin's demise?,"I see it everywhere - average users who seem legitimately happy that Bitcoin dropped. Not to buy in - but to laugh in observation.The billionaires and ""economists"" have legit reasons to fear bitcoin or lash out at cryptocurrency because they are threatened, or dont understand the tech or profit from the dip or futures. Sure. However what of all these average users?

It seems so strange to me that someone would get so emotional that they rage at Bitcoin supporters, take to twitter to stalk and mock users, or seem giddy in seeing any news that might point to Bitcoin's total destruction.

I understand console fanboys or tribalistic american politics, but... to seemingly have pure hatred for an inanimate object? To take joy in investments going south? To feel happiness that Bitcoin went from 20k to 8k? To deny all reality just to justify a belief Bitcoin will go to $0 this year?

Even if I were to think Bitcoin is a joke, I wouldnt feel happiness in its failute or anger in its success.

Price rose to 19,000..feeling stoked

At around 14,000 I decide to transfer my coins to a margin enabled broker. I was confident that Bitcoin would go back to 19000 and I wanted to recover my losses and make extra $. So I use 2-1 leverage. It goes back to 17,000(I'm sure you all remember that awesome weekend when it seemed like Bitcoin would make a full recovery to 19.5k again), and I'm over the moon. I have music playing. Good times. I feel like $25,000 in a few weeks. 

Then as well know..things went south. Korea, regulation, tether, etc. I begin to lose so much. It goes from 17000 to 10,000. It tries to recover to 13,000 but then plunges again. At this point, I am close to being closed-out on my margin positions but maybe there is hope. Nope. I get liquidated, all the money gone near the bottom. 

total loss: 26 bitcoin that I would have had had just not used margin.

Chinese Yuan Devaluation: Trigger For BTC Rally?,"&amp;nbsp;

Wall Street Journal reported, at 1:16 AM EST, that the Chinese yuan had posted its biggest loss against the US dollar since 2015. 

&amp;nbsp;


**source** https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/chinese-yuan-poised-for-biggest-one-day-drop-since-2015-devaluation-1518070593

&amp;nbsp;

From 1:30 AM to 3:30 AM EST (which is late afternoon in Beijing), BTC moved from $7,800s to $8,300s.  No proof that one caused the other, but...

&amp;nbsp;


BTC had a huge rally 15 months ago when the Yuan had a similar fall against the USD (leading to China spending 2017 trying to crack down on crypto):

&amp;nbsp;

**source** http://www.nasdaq.com/article/chinese-investors-turn-to-bitcoin-amid-yuan-depreciation-cm705038

&amp;nbsp;

I’m happy with whatever moves the price up, but CNY devaluation news used to be a reliable indicator of a BTC rally in 2015 &amp; 2016.  And maybe now.

Small Coinbase explanation (yes I'm a noob),"Okay all, first post here after some time lurking.

I'm on coinbase for buying/selling crypto. I don't really get how it works tho :

--During the dip, I bought, when it was shown around 7k. However, my transaction was apparently made at 10k. 

--Right now, I've set an alarm for when Ethereum would be higher than 1K, as the dashboard shows it a 671.73€. The alarm went off immediately.

Wtf ? That's a 30% difference price, not to mention the fees that are already quite high.

Now I'm not complaining, but I'd like to understand where I can see the prices that are used for the transactions. Cause if I sell at 671 for something that is worth 1000, but I buy at 10k something that's worth 7K, the calculations are quite different than one might think at first sight.

Any help? :) (Sorry for newbish question)",1518080257,08/02/2018 08:57:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w3jmd/small_coinbase_explanation_yes_im_a_noob/,0

Bitcoin is not a store of Value Like Gold Winklevoss's !!,"The reason it's not a limited amount (Max 21 mill coins max) is that there are now 1300 ""blockchain based cryptos"" which are all the same thing in a way. Crypto coins are about as rare as Pine Cones. There are literally hundreds of billions of them now and you can start one up with a Macbook pro and a teenager. Doesn't replace Gold which is still equally as rare as it ever was.(Which is also ironically not that rare either ... but still not infinitely available)... Anyway, Humans decided they love gold and attached value to it long ago and we've all slowly accepted that ... Bitcoin and crypto has a long time to go before its globally accepted as a store of value... For now ... it can go to $1 and I still wouldn't buy...

Some [technical] questions regarding Lightning,"Hello coiners,

I have a few queries regarding the Lightning Network. Any advice would be much appreciated. 

I understand there are several implementations of the Lightning Network that already exist. Are any of these more/less developed than the others? 
Do they each require a running instance of bitcoind ? If so, is it essential that bitcoind be configured to download the full block chain? or can it run with pruning configured? 

As far as the Lightning implementations go, how developed are the APIs? I would like to interact with Lighting from PHP, presumably over REST interface. Is this supported yet? I caught the Blockstream Lightning Charge Client release, which looks promising, but it seems like its limited to recieving payments, as opposed to sending?",1518090330,08/02/2018 11:45:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w48ii/some_technical_questions_regarding_lightning/,6

Beware the Square: Issues with Cash App for Bitcoin Withdrawals,"I've personally been waiting over 11 hours now for a withdrawal and this isn't an uncommon occurrence. I have seen similar complaints from users on Twitter and other boards now that I've looked into the issue more.

I know they have probably been slammed, but it seems they don't quite understand how Bitcoin works. They may even be possibly hedging against losses from their premium pricing by intentionally delaying withdrawals or not have the Bitcoin reserves that are being bought and sold in their app. Not saying that they are, but something is off and I never leave a good conspiracy theory out of the picture.

[The reply from Cash Support to the issue does not inspire confidence.](https://twitter.com/DFSBettor/status/961293268381249537)

While they put out that nice little fancy children's website about Bitcoin, their FAQ is barren and they seem to keep bank hours.

I just wanted to throw this out there so people know what they might be getting into at the early stages of this whole thing. I personally try to time it right if I'm paying a premium for instant Bitcoin, albeit a smaller one with Square/Cash, so this is an issue. Especially when it gets stuck for hours and you can't do anything.

Hopefully, it will get better but Robinhood needs to set the bar higher when they debut.

EDIT: [This](https://twitter.com/CashSupport/status/961625060380323840) is their response to the withdrawal issue today. Wait 24 hours. Unacceptable. If they don't send cash that way, then Bitcoin shouldn't be any different. If they weren't prepared to do simple things like withdrawals, that's a huge problem.

EDIT 2: Finally got an email telling me that they can take up to 24 hours or more to process and to contact them at the end of the day, when of course they won't be around to assist. I would highly advise anyone to stay away as this is unreliable, untrustworthy and not transparent in any fashion when you use their service.

"Mario Draghi: ""Financial institutions in the EU are showing a limited appetite for digital currencies like Bitcoin...recent developments, such as the listing of Bitcoin futures by US exchanges, could lead European banks too to hold positions in Bitcoin, and therefore we will certainly look at that”.","&gt; Draghi has previously stated that the ECB does not have the authority to regulate bitcoin but his remarks this week suggest a more supervisory – not regulatory – approach to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies adopted or allowed among EU banks and possibly nations.

Bitpanda 100% segwit + batching,"Received this today:

&gt; Thanks to full SegWit &amp; Batching - major Bitcoin transaction fee reduction.
&gt; Over the past months our engineers have been working hard on keeping costs as low as possible for our customers and we are now proud to announce the rollout of full SegWit support and transaction batching, which will significantly reduce Bitcoin transaction fees and help the whole network and community.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin transaction costs have been really high in the last couple of weeks and peaked at the end of last year. To tackle this issue we implemented SegWit support back in November 2017 and are proud to announce that Bitpanda is now running 100% on SegWit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, our engineers have also implemented transaction batching on our platform, from which the whole Bitcoin community will benefit. We believe that it’s our responsibility to implement such features, to strengthen the ecosystem and stay at the forefront of Bitcoin’s technological progress.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitpanda is now one of the very first trading platforms that take advantage of a full vertical integration of both SegWit and transaction batching.
&gt; 
&gt; These two state-of-the-art methods for using the Bitcoin blockchain more efficiently will ensure the lowest levels of transaction fees possible for our customers:
&gt; The complete fund handling on our hotwallet system is now fully SegWit integrated and each transaction uses the benefits of SegWit. Thus we can now take full advantage of lower Bitcoin fees for sending transactions.
&gt; To reduce fees even further, we started processing transactions in batches. This method basically compresses Bitcoin transactions and is a very efficient way to significantly lower transaction fees.
&gt; 
&gt; We are passing along these benefits to you, so Bitpanda customers will be able to save up to 80% per Bitcoin transaction and still see their transaction confirmed in the next block.
&gt; Kind regards from Vienna,
&gt; Team Bitpanda",1518098103,08/02/2018 13:55:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w4x7x/bitpanda_100_segwit_batching/,78
Hi /r/Bitcoin! I quit my job to start Cointaxes to answer questions about taxes and digital currencies so you can have confidence even if you're not a HODLer! Sharing our first comprehensive article on the Coinbase &amp; Gemini 1099-K. Would love your input on ANY other topics or questions! :),"Hi /r/Bitcoin! Thank you for reading this. 

I felt the world of digital currencies is a bit too uncertain, so I want to do what I can to create more confidence and certainty! Please let me know if you have any questions or comments (I'll probably respond to every comment here!)

&gt; [**Check out our first comprehensive article on the Coinbase / Gemini 1099-K**](https://www.cointaxes.com/1099)

&gt; **Some ""fun"" facts you may not know about digital currency taxes**

Here's two quick ""fun"" facts you may not know. We will be posting in-depth articles on these, too. [Consider subscribing to our newsletter to hear first when they've been published!](https://cointaxes.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ffa9bb9a681d0dcb59dcbf2cb&amp;id=06ed9ffdd3)

* **Non-deductible personal loss:** You should never exchange your digital currency directly for ANY goods or services. If you happen to have a loss on that trade, it will be non-deductable as capital gains losses ONLY apply to ""investment"" not ""personal use"" activity.  You can read more about this on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/01/03/what-you-should-know-about-taxation-of-cryptocurrencies/#523290821346), [Time](http://time.com/money/5007068/theres-a-huge-hidden-bitcoin-tax-that-you-need-to-know-about/) and the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409).

* **FBAR requirements:** This isn't explicitly tax related, actually, but a LOT of my US friends do not know about this important filing. If you *ever* on a single day, even, held $10,000 USD worth of value overseas (Binance, for example), you must meet your FBAR online filing requirements. The penalties can be severe for failure to disclose. The deadline is April 15, but it will be extended to October 15 if you fail to file on time. You can read more about this on official government sites [General FBAR information](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar), [FBAR FAQS (not super helpful IMO)](https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/docs/FBAR_EFILING_FAQ.pdf) and the [online form itself](https://bsaefiling1.fincen.treas.gov/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/htmldefault.html).

&gt; **About Cointaxes** 

Cointaxes was formed and funded with the mission to establish confidence and certainty around cryptocurrency.

We see global adoption of digital currencies as an inevitability. The uncertainty lies in how effectively and smoothly this once-in-a-lifetime shift occurs. As a tax preparation service, we have a special seat in the cryptocurrency ecosystem directly related to this uncertainty: it is our job to help both citizens and governments around the world understand how to use and treat digital currencies.

* We will regularly invite regulators, lawyers and tax experts to private discussions and public webinars to ensure you will have a firm understanding with each regulatory shift as the world adopts cryptocurrencies.

* We will conduct proprietary research and publish Cointaxes Guides to answer questions you may have about using your digital currency.

* We will provide [high quality cryptocurrency tax preparation software](http://www.cointaxes.com) for individuals and tax professionals.

&gt; **If our mission excites you** 

* Please know that we are hiring. Contact jobs@cointaxes.com with a resume and cover letter.

* If you're are regulator or a crypto-experienced legal or tax professional, please contact experts@cointaxes.com with some background information and reason for connecting.

* Please consider following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cointaxes) and liking our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/cointaxes/)!

When the haters say Bitcoin has no value....CFTC support....,"I don't know about you guys but one of the most satisfying parts of the US Senate Banking Committee was:

Senator Mike Rounds asked Giancarlo whether bitcoin is a commodity, a security, or a hybrid. The CFTC chairman said it displayed features of multiple asset classes. But when viewed as a store of value like gold, bitcoin behaves “very much like a commodity,” he said.

I have so many people that have said, ""Bitcoin has no value. It has to be backed by something. Like the Dollar and Gold."" Then you try to explain and they dont understand. Because there too busy thinking of other things. These are also the ones that like to randomly text and say it looks like your Bitcoin is crashing whenever it dips. Then it goes back up and they're quiet.

What is most gratifying was this sort of validation of the value argument. Because when sharing this - they're silent. They only follow the words of government, media, etc. One actually had a light bulb come on and started asking me really good questions about it. I could tell he was trying to understand.

1% of addresses own 90% of total bitcoins,"I see it as a huge risk that 1% of the bitcoin owners control 90% of the available bitcoins. And probably none of those 1% are actually here on r/Bitcoin and responding to the HODL movement.

The impact of the 99% bitcoin owners is actually very minimal. The actual huge impact on the bitcoin price is the 1% owners.

Just thinking about the last crash, weather the selling panic was from the 1% or 99%?

Mining question - Zero option,"As I understand it to successfully mine a block you have to be the first miner to solve the hash problem, then you get the block reward; and the hash problem is not so much an enormous computation, more like an enormous guessing game to guess the right 64 bit hexadecimal hash value. Only I read somewhere that to succeed you don't need to guess the exact value, just a value that is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO the blocks' hash value. You can see from the blockchain that each successful block has had millions of attempts to guess a valid answer before being successfully mined.
I obviously must be missing the point somewhere, but instead of spending heaps of electricity on massive computer processing power, why not just guess zero every time. Zero will always be less than or equal to the hash value, and you would have a valid answer first time every time and win every block!",1518104813,08/02/2018 15:46:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w5ob8/mining_question_zero_option/,1

I wrote a short story about Satoshi Nakamoto... but in portuguese! Translators?,"I'm a good writer in my own language and I recently published, in the largest Brazilian publisher (Editora Record), a book that also contains a 70 pages short story about a guy claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto. In this story, I not only describe the fanciful way in which he would have invented the cryptocurrency, but I also discuss the origin of money, its various forms throughout history, central banks, the banking cartels based on the fractional reserve system, why Bitcoin is more real than fiduciary currencies, deep web, crime, liberty, totalitarism, etc. 

Are there any speakers of English, who also speak Portuguese, who have an interest in reading it? I'm looking for translators. 

The short story is called ""To Satoshi what is Satoshi's"" an allusion to the words of Jesus: ""Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."" The title of my book is ""A Sábia Ingenuidade do Dr. João Pinto Grande"" (i.e. ""The wise ingenuity of John Bigg Cock, attorney at law""). :-)

Reminder: Switching to segwit is really easy,"I put off moving my btc to a segwit-enabled wallet because I thought it was scary and confusing, but it's easy.

Just download the newest version of Electrum, create a new wallet, and when it asks if you want it to be segwit, say yes. Then you just do ""sweep private keys,"" and put your old private key in, and electrum sweeps it into a segwit address, no problem. That's it.

"Sold off my Bitcoin then bought back in, what to do about taxes?","Hi everyone! I sold off at 6,800 this week anticipating to pick back up at a lower price, but ended up buying back in when it climbed to 7,200 (thank god I did, or else I would have lost my chance with this awesome rebound!). 
I'm wondering how next year's taxes should be handled assuming I hold for the rest of the year. 

Since I originally got in last year at 6,500, I feel like technically I'd be working with a capital gains tax even though I lost a little bit during my dumb move this week. Since I've invested my original BTC amount in other alts, it gets tricky to say what is a loss and what is a gain. 

I have records of all my altcoin purchases with dates and times and values of each, so I plan on seeing a tax professional this year. I was just hoping for a little bit of insight from this lovely community on the matter.

Electrum Personal Server - The best way to connect your hardware wallet to your full node,"Electrum is a popular bitcoin wallet, but it is not a full node wallet as it synchronizes itself using third-party Electrum servers. The servers must be trusted to verify the rules of bitcoin, they can trick Electrum wallets into accepting fake bitcoin transactions which, for example, print infinite money. Bitcoin's security model requires that most economic activity is backed by full nodes. The Electrum servers must also be trusted with the user's privacy, as wallets send all their bitcoin addresses to the server. Spying on wallets is not much more complicated than simply grepping the server logs. Electrum wallets by default also connect to servers using their own IP address, linking it further to their revealed bitcoin addresses.

A way to avoid these problems is for users to run their own Electrum server and connect their wallets only to it. But this requires significant resource usage: the full unpruned blockchain, transaction index and an extra address index, as well as more RAM and CPU usage compared to just a full node. Servers are not well suited to being shut down and started up again, they are typically always online.

Electrum servers store a database of every bitcoin address ever used, which is inherently not scalable. This is resource-intensive and therefore pushes users towards centralized solutions. An alternative way would be to store only your own addresses and transactions.

Introducing Electrum Personal Server; an implementation of the Electrum server protocol which fulfills the specific need of using the Electrum UI with full node verification and privacy, but without the heavyweight server backend, for a single user. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, mnemonic recovery phrases and so on can still be used, but backed by the user's own full node.

An alpha version of Electrum Personal Server can be found on the repository: https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server

Before using, the wallet user must configure Electrum Personal Server with their master public key and those addresses are imported into Bitcoin Core as watch-only. If the wallet contains historical transactions then it must be rescanned. One of Electrum's motivating features is ""instant on"", which is therefore traded away when using Electrum Personal Server in return for full node verification and privacy. Although if a brand new empty wallet is created there is no need to rescan. A script like Electrum Personal Server is also well suited to use private transaction broadcasting tech like dandelion or broadcasting through tor.

Using Electrum with Electrum Personal Server is probably the most resource-efficient way right now to use a hardware wallet connected to your own full node. People who make use of Blockstream Satellite could use it to have an off-the-grid node connected to Electrum if that is their preferred wallet. In the situation of a traveller staying a cheap hostels, they could sync their node every couple of days to download recent blocks and use Electrum. Hopefully this software can be part of the plan to get full node wallets into the hands of as many people as possible.

The same kind of ideas could be applied to other lightweight wallets. For example a full nodes can run on smartphones with pruning and blocksonly, then a similar script would allow the user to connect their Samourai Wallet, Breadwallet or GreenAddress app to their own full node.

Segwit protocol question regarding P2WSH,"
In segwit p2wsh, the witnessprogram includes a push of a 32 bytes SHA256 of the redeemscript. 

Rather than bloating out the blockchain with 12 extra bytes, why was this not reduced to 20 bytes with ripemd the same way P2SH does? It would seem straightforward enough to use the witness version byte to indicate the difference between p2wsh and p2wphk, rather than replying upon the size difference. And it would save 12 bytes in each output, which could translate into a lot of space on L1.

BIP 141 states: 

&gt; The increased size improves security against possible collision attacks, as 2^80 work is not infeasible anymore 

If this is true for P2WSH, then why not also apply the same logic to P2WPKH ? 2^80 work to perform a hostile collision attack would also be able to target existing p2phk utxo; meaning that satoshi's goldmine could be unlocked for 2^79 work. 

If this is an expected attack vector, then perhaps p2wpkh should also have used 32 bytes, and a transition plan to retire old utxo's in discussion. It this is not an expected attack; then why increase the size of p2wsh ? Perhaps it is seen as easier to attack redeemscripts ?

Possible future numbers of investors,"Let's not start our numbers from world population, but rather take into account only numbers of people who have internet access. [Estimated worldwide internet users by the end of 2017 is about 3.2 billions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage). Now let's exclude groups that will be the least likely to invest.

* First, oldest age group, which is the least likely to invest in crypto: [19.8% of internet users are people aged 55-64](https://www.google.ru/imgres?imgurl=http://www.statista.com/graphic/1/272365/age-distribution-of-internet-users-worldwide.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.statista.com/statistics/272365/age-distribution-of-internet-users-worldwide/&amp;h=743&amp;w=1000&amp;tbnid=gMANBowkLxMv8M:&amp;tbnh=160&amp;tbnw=216&amp;usg=__DUG0BFfnBWDSDGMDkYBqtmBFo1Y%3D&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=uopV0_GB7MbzHM&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQp7L525bZAhWEfywKHb3KAUwQ9QEILTAA) Leaving us with 80.2% or 2.5664 billions of possible investors.

* Now how many of these people are familiar with/curious about investing? [Sadly I only found numbers for traditional stocks in US](http://news.gallup.com/poll/190883/half-americans-own-stocks-matching-record-low.aspx). As it states, in USA there are only 50% of people younger than 55yo are investing in traditional stocks. Taking these numbers we now may assume that by depending on the economy of a country, there are from 5-55% of people with internet access investing in traditional stocks all over the world. These numbers are pure speculation based on the fact that the more income a given individual has, the more likely he/she will invest, so depending on the economy of a given country percentages may vary drastically. By average it is roughly 30%(rough, very rough numbers) of all internet users excluding people older than 55 are willing to invest. 769.92 millions of people around the world are possible investors today.

* Now, gender. [3.43% of crypto investors are females](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bitcoin-s-gender-divide-could-be-a-bad-sign-experts-say-1.4458884) I assume this percentage will grow soon, because the gap by gender among tradional stocks investors is very low, 47% of investors are women. Men are more likely than women to say they have an above-average risk tolerance (39% to 29%), we may assume that among higher risk investments around 43% are women. However, it is still very unlikely that gender distribution among crypto investors will change to such an extent any time soon. We may expect no more than 15% in a few years. So we may expect 384.96 millions of males and 51.328 millions of females. 

**Total estimate: 436.288 millions.** Today there are 23 million wallets. And because there are exchanges wallets, also multiple wallets for one person and also forgotten wallets, we may use this is as an estimate of people currently having some amount of bitcoin. If so and if stars align, we *may* expect that the amount of these people will rise to 436.288 millions. **x19 from now**.

It took me literally an afternoon to add Segwit support.,"I have a fork of the ancient JS brainwallet project (https://github.com/brainwallet/brainwallet.github.io). The project was closed permanently 3 years ago because brain wallets are generally unsafe, but it is nonetheless a very useful interactive tool to learn how transactions are constructed.

On a whim I decided to add support for Segwit addresses (well, only the P2SH-P2WPKH ones). It turns out to be not so complicated. Most of the work is just to implement BIP-143 transaction serialization. The diff is merely 140 lines of change (100 new lines and 40 removed) against a 3-year-old project that didn't even have P2SH.

Quick highlights:

- Bulletproofs are _general_ zero knowledge proofs (like SNARKs)
- They allow efficient rangeproofs for Confidential Transactions
- Aggregation possible within a transaction for logarithmic space saving
- Batch validation possible for roughly a 10x speed increase
- Can be used to extend the idea of scriptless scripts, among others

I am studying a Journalism degree in the UK and I am making an assignment on the sudden rise in popularity in cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, over the past few months.

I am looking for people who are available in the next week or so to interview for no more than a couple of minutes over the phone or via webcam on this topic (why they started investing in Bitcoin, why they believe it boomed all of a sudden etc).

If you would be okay with helping me out for this assignment, it would be greatly appreciated. If you put a comment down below saying you're interested, I will be in touch!

Physical Bitcoin Mining Hardware Store Bitmart Opens in South Africa!,"Bitcoin might be magical internet money, but it has a very physical side in the form of the mining equipment needed to maintain the network. And if you’re someone that doesn’t like to leave an online trail or use a credit card for all your purchases, nothing beats a store IRL. That’s why bitcoin hardware stores are popping up all over the world, and now miners in South Africa too can just walk into a shop, pay on the spot and get their rigs to go.

How could taxation work?,"This is a thought that occurred to me reading another thread. I'm sure it has been considered in great depth, but I couldn't find a good discussion.

In a world of cryptocurrencies, how will taxation work?

To state my position: I completely disagree with our societal reliance on financial institutions in general. I completely disagree with the necessity to use an intermediate institution in almost every aspect of using currency. However, i'm also glad I live (UK) in a society that taxes its citizens based on wealth (or at least tries to) to pay for communal services like the NHS (fuck you Trump).

In a world where I receive my salary in bitcoin, invest using bitcoin and buy things with bitcoin, are we completely reliant on honest declaration in order to tax people appropriately? If so, this is a problem not just for governments who might dislike bitcoin, but for citizens who DO like bitcoin.

I don't really have a specific question. I just want to know whether a feasible system can be implemented to circumvent our reliance on financial institutions and 3rd parties whilst retaining a society that is capable of taxing based on wealth.",1518119773,08/02/2018 19:56:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w7luu/how_could_taxation_work/,3

"My thoughts about Roubini, the economist famous for predicting the 2008 global financial crisis said to see bitcoin at 0$","First I believe he has really good friends to be given such importance for his crazy statement . 
Regarding the crisis 2008 and what he predicted I see no reason at all to give him any credibility . Why ? Well because when the stockmarkets rise the number of economist raising alarm bells about the coming crash grow day by day. He was not the only one to predict the crisis of 2008 and now many famous or less famous economists predict the crash of the stocks. This is so easy to predict the crash of the market or coming financial crisis when for some years we were seeing mainly upward trends . Right now I am sure almost 1 out of 2 economist predict the next financial crisis . Should we give them the title of Nostradamus ? Maybe not yea. So Roubini for me has no credit in predicting anything for 2008 as this was the general trend in the expert community . Nothing new really . However Roubini could make the effort to learn about BTC when it was at 10$ and predict the rise . But no he can only predict the fall. Hahaha. Roubini is smart only in one direction, how to predict the worse but when it's about to make couple of millions in selling cheaply bought BTC at 15k, for this , no no , this is not his area of expertise .  I really feel sorry for him for not getting a job he deserves instead of spreading Fud here and there.
No problem if someone believe that BTC will go down and I have no clue what will happen with the price. If someone wants to share with the public as why it will crash then great, I'd like to find out about it but for now we don't have any specific information except that it has value because people believe it has and then it has no value.

some thoughts from a trader,"Over the last 1.5 years I have actively traded bitcoin.  But first let me give some background; I have experience trading commodities and FX since 2007 for several major companies and hedge funds.  I am not a fundamental trader generally; I work on technicals.  As a trader, I do not fundamentally believe ""in"" bitcoin nor do I distrust it.  It is merely a vehicle I can trade (notice I didn't say ""asset"").  As a trader, my job is not to be long or to be short, but to be **right.**

I recognize that the average investor wants simplicity; they want to HODL.  HODL is great in markets that are growing with the addition of capital and expansion of value.  For example, the equities (stocks) market is a fairly reasonable place to HODL.  The US economy continues to expand, and that expansion fuels a bullish bias to the markets.

Now with that said, as a pro trader, you cannot survive by HODL'ing.  You need to **integrate**.  This means capturing as much value as possible in moves of price both up and down.  Until the launch of the bitcoin futures market, there was not a cost-effective way to short the market.  Therefore I have traded from the long-side only.  Shorting can of course be dangerous and in a highly volatile environment is not worth the risk (neither is being long!) but my point is that I integrate small moves upwards.  I buy, and either it goes higher to a point I'm looking at as an interim top and I sell, or it goes down, and I'll stop the position out as a certain loss.

I trade based on technicals: mathematical signals that are based on price-action.  With this trading strategy, my win rate has been over 70% and my profit:loss ratio well in-excess of 5:1.  Most pros would be very happy w/ those numbers.  I cannot tell you how to trade, if you should be fundamental, technical, or hybrid.  All are valid approaches in a liquid market.

What I'm telling you is that trading, e.g. 'integrating' as much of the price action as possible, is a different and I think better method than HODL.  It also happens to be way less stressful.

Value of Bitcoin,"I've been thinking recently about how supply and demand determines value and how it applies to bitcoin and crypto in general. This idea sounds logical with traditional markets and honestly I can't think of anything more sound than that (although admittedly I'm no econ major).  That being the case I would like to throw a few thoughts out to the community to hear your feedback because I believe it can be a lot more complicated than that for Crypto in the current market environment. 

Thought 1

If there are currently only 17,000,000 bitcoin in existence and there are ~7,000,000,000 people alive today, then only ~.2 % can own a full bitcoin.

Thought 2

The bitcoin landscape has (like any other financial system) has a high concentration of coins owned by a small percentage of bitcoiners (Winlklevoss twins, Satoshi, government auction recipients, etc). Not that this in itself is either a good or bad thing necessarily, but it is something to keep in mind.

Thought 3

There are currently federally regulated futures products (CBOE, CME, and soon to be NASDAQ) covering non federally regulated trading markets in bitcoin which opens up the opportunity for some serious good ol boy market manipulation IMO. 

Thought 4

Over the last few years I have personally witnessed market outages at some of the largest bitcoin exchanges during record highs in the price of bitcoin.  This IMO couldn't of been planned better if they wanted to artificially restrict the appreciation of the price of bitcoin. 

Thought 5

All of the current largest of exchanges are centralized and I know that at least Coinbase has an API for bots to algorithmicly trade in high speed back and forth limit orders which is creating the current fiat value on these exchanges. 

Thought 6

There is a major learning curve for not only bitcoin and crypto in general, but also for why crypto is better than fiat. Additionally there are learning curves in how to securely store your digital assets. 

Final thoughts:

If everything above is correct, then I believe in order for bitcoin to be allowed to appreciate at its natural rate we need to take custody of our coins as soon as their purchased on the exchanges. This would limit any possible manipulation with respect to your own coins while allowing you access to any Forks that come along. 

Any feedback from the community is always appreciated.",1518128532,08/02/2018 22:22:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w8pft/value_of_bitcoin/,3
Do I need to pay tax in 2017 if Kraken has defaulted?,"So here the short story. December 26th 2017 rolls around and I transferred my BTC to Kraken because they were the first to ""verify"" me. I sold off all of the BTC before 2018 on Kraken. Kraken refuses to let me withdraw USD so I am reconverting the ""USD"" to bitcoin and sending to GDAX, and taking small losses in 2018.

The question is do I need to claim the sale for 2017? I mean if I'm not allowed to access my money its not real right? This transaction was never really realized as its a scam, correct? Can I just report it on 2018?

How Bitcoin Wallet lost my money.,"So for the longest time I've been holding onto about [.0146 BTC](https://blockchain.info/address/6b021d8e5dfd4fd7bf8cafa4e003c07770d3b527) I know, I know it's not a lot of money, but you know what, it was mine. It's been sitting on an old phone of mine for the longest time, since about 2013. Really looking back I probably should have put more money into bitcoin, but I digress. Anyways today I decided I'd probably try to do something with that small amount and move it around. So I started up the bitcoin wallet and tried transferring it to coinbase. Granted the app was an old version but it says that it was there, and that it was transferring. It refreshed saying I had 0 in my balance. Looking around I didn't see the balance move anywhere. I tried checking the blockchain and whatnot, but nothing got moved. So I backed up my private key thinking it'd actually backup, (I had two keys on the app) it said it did, but when I recovered it, it had only backed up the one key that had nothing on it. For whatever reason it wouldn't let me access that other wallet, wouldn't let me change it to default. For whatever reason it thought it was compromised because it was so old, but it wasn't. It's just old.

And now this wallet has disappeared from my phone.

Before anyone points out to me ""THAT's A SCAM!"", I know it probably is, I don't particularly care. My Coinbase account is barren and unusable since it STILL has me locked in as a Japanese citizen. I'm testing the waters to see if I can get free Bitcoin for some unknown reason and will probably never actually use this account anyway.

Selling house for Bitcoin?,"Hello! I've been invested in Bitcoin and other Crytpocurrencies for a while and it has become something I'm quite passionate about. 

My home in Texas has been on the market for some time but I recently decided that if possible I'd like to sell it for Bitcoin (or possibly other major Cryptos). How would I go about doing this? I have tried to find websites to list it but it seems most of the sites I've found aren't updated.

Fact Checking Roger Ver's claims on Info Wars,"I'd like to start a thread crowdsourcing the fact checking of some of the falsifiable claims he made today on info wars (that is, claims that we know to be false and can prove it. Not conspiracy theories that are not falsifiable). 

I shall list some of these claims below (of which I am currently working on). 

**""I have never publicly said that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto.""**

So far, this seems to be technically true. I can't find any source where he makes the claim that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto. The best I could come up with is this tweet linking to a removed youtube video: https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/881145760263294976?lang=en

**""It is true that I was arrested for selling firecrackers online.""**

Of course, no one is disputing that he was arrested and served time (not even Ver denies this), but is it true that it was just fire-crackers. According to wikipedia and the arrest record, mixed accounts - it depends on how you are defining ""explosive"" and ""firecracker"": 

&gt;In 2002, Ver pleaded guilty after selling explosives, marketed as Pest Control Report 2000, on eBay, which the U.S. Department of Justice described as ""dealing in explosives without a license"", and he was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison. The Missouri company, Max 2000 Inc. that had manufactured Pest Control Report 2000, agreed to cease selling the agricultural firecrackers in January 2003 after selling more than one million of them. The company had been selling the product illegally to fireworks wholesalers and retailers from early 1998. Pest Control Report 2000 had been used nationally to control infestations of birds. The explosives were banned because they could cause serious injuries or death.

https://web.archive.org/web/20150213142114/http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2002/verPlea.htm

**""Bitcoin Cash has performed better than Bitcoin core over the past month, 3 months, and 6 months.""** as of Feb 8th, 2018.

False for both 1 and 6 month performance (and that is including today's BCH pump directly before he went on, so I am being generous including that):

* 1 month: BTC: -44.709%, BCH: -47.75% Best performance: BTC
* 3 month: BTC: +10.4452, BCH: +99.3701% Best performance: BCH
* 6 month: BTC: +138.5462%, BCH: +95.9735% Best performance: BTC

https://www.coindesk.com/price/
https://www.coindesk.com/market-center/bitcoin-cash/

**""The CEO of block stream is a member of the Bilderberg Group""**

Pretty sure Roger just threw this one out there because he knew the Info Wars Audience would gobble it up. Not only can I find no proof that Adam Back is a member of Bilderberg; I cant even find where this idea even comes from. The best I could do was find a writeup on Bilderbergconspiracy.com (confirmation bias incoming) saying that Blockstream (who Adam Back is CEO of) took money from a french insurance company called AXA Strategic Ventures, whose CEO and Chairman Henri De Castries is the current chairman of Bilderberg. 

http://www.bilderbergconspiracy.com/bilderberg-group-taking-over-bitcoin/

Working on verifying if ***any*** of that is true. 

**""Bitcoin cash is capable of scaling on chain and taking on the entire world right now with fast, cheap, and reliable transactions for everyone.""**

I don't think it takes much to point out how absurd it would be to claim that 6 billion people could transact on the BCH blockchain right now and still have be ""fast, cheap, and reliable"".

If you can think of any other claims that he made worth fact checking or feel I have mischaracterized his claims, please leave a comment saying so.

"In second foray with vendor services, Coinbase released poor, misleading tax info to IRS primarily because they did not structure their business correctly.","This started out as a comment reply, but it really just needs its own full-length post.

The simple, totally-avoidable error here was not issuing 1099-B forms and it is so damn obvious that nobody at Coinbase has given a second thought to the coming years of audit hell they've just subjected their most devoted customers to.

Even **itBit got this right** (what, you guys couldn't stand up to the lawsuit and force the IRS to delineate new tax code to deal with this?), following up on the sudden KYC/AML debacle every exchange forced its customers through leading up to this.

This simple, utterly lazy error is going to have the IRS expecting filers to be paying an additional 15.3% self-employment tax - in addition to the accountants' fees we'll all have to pay to keep the IRS off of us for the next 10 years.

Par for the course at best, Coinbase, and at worst this is fiduciary malpractice.  Bullshit you're a ""financial transaction services company"" - you are both a retail broker and an exchange operator!  If you can establish a d/b/a for GDAX, you can establish another as an asset manager/broker to at least be able to release the right forms for your customers (we *are* your customers, not your **employees!!!**).

*Sure,* I can now deduct my cost basis and my expenses from these numbers, but let's call a spade a spade here - you throw your customers to the wolves and made zero effort to cover the fact that you did the absolute bare minimum to keep yourself in compliance while meanwhile active traders now have nice, fat 8-figure audit flags raised on their file at the world's shittiest, most ruthless agency.

Think about what you just did to all of your biggest supporters over the years who helped you to grow your business to where it is now.  I cannot believe this.

This would have been appropriate if we were your contractors a la the form that Uber issues its drivers with the gross sales and itemized corporate fees - for *sales*, not for either long term capital gains nor for short term gains.  This is rather salient that given your own characterization of the fiduciary capacity of your business, you hold customer fiat cash deposits under FDIC protection, probably with a custodian bank, probably in a money market or similarly-structured fund with the same reporting standards and requirements as retail investment brokers and money managers alike.

Was it **really** that difficult to just spin up another little shell subsidiary to handle your obvious broker-dealer business?

Now, for we poor bastards who don't have the luxury of funding a *private army* of management consultants and CPAs, we get to shit a bunch of .csv files into a database and fend for ourselves against a furious and poorly-educated IRS that's convinced we all made and owe a whole lot more money than any of us actually did...

She was like - but the price fluctuates so much. To which I replied 1btc is worth 1btc. She grasped the concept and accepted payment through the her cb account   (.005btc). Later that night she posted on Instagram announcing to all her clients that she is now accepting Bitcoin for her services. Couldn't be happier.

"The ""Closest coin to Satoshi's whitepaper"" argument","This argument really does make zero sense, and I have no clue why it's the best point team alt can think of. 

It's like saying Linux is closer to window 3.1 so it should be the ""real"" windows. We evolve, the code gets better, there are votes, and there is only one Bitcoin. 

I would like to ask isn't there a lot of other coins that would be closer to the original whitepaper, not saying BTC isn't closer, just that there isn't any justifiable argument other then they just wanted to steal the Bitcoin name to try n make some quick cash.

Coins that are Asic resistant which is closer to the ""one CPU, one Vote"" part of the whitepaper.

Let's disarm any arguments about mining being 'wasteful' and push for mining operations to publicly pledge the use of renewable energy.,"The case against mining typically consists of two arguments:

* Mining is ""useless"".
* Mining is bad for the environment, or wasteful.

The first can quite easily be countered: the energy spent by miners serves as the security of the network. An attacker requires more energy than the rest of the network, which makes attacking the network a daunting task. As the energy consumption serves to secure the network, mining is not useless.  ""If your security is free, your security is not very good"" - *can't remember who I'm quoting here*.

The second can be harder to counter. How do we convince others ('outsiders') that the energy spent is necessary and desirable, that we should want this to continue? After all, if the energy used is non-renewable, it does indeed harm the environment. 

The one thing that can void this argument is the widespread use of renewable energy in mining operations. If no harm is being done to the environment, then the argument of wastefulness no longer applies. Achieving this would be one less potential negative news story about Bitcoin. We should strive for Bitcoin to be seen as a positive technological development on all fronts, and public pledges for the use of renewable energy might go a long way.",1518172112,09/02/2018 10:28:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wckvy/lets_disarm_any_arguments_about_mining_being/,1

Need help with a bitcoin statistics page Im doing,"Hey guys, I need your help with a project I'm doing, let me tell you what it is and thren you can let me draw your conclusions in the comments.

My idea is to make a page of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency statistics. Why? Because we all know that the price of Bitcoin is based on speculation. I am not saying it lacks of value, at all, what I mean is that the volatility of bitcoin is based on large part due to the speculation that many of the buyers have at the time of getting involved in the bitcoin market. (FUD VS FOMO)

When I get involved in bitcoin I started to get interested in what the rest of the world things about bitcoin, some things can be read in broadcast groups or in talks with friends, but it is very difficult for an individual to get big numbers (a sort of Big Data of bitcoin).

I started to get questions in my head Did the chinese have the same projections of bitcoin price for 2019 that the americans, on what exchange do people trust? What currencies do people think they are scams? What currencies do people think will grow the most this year?

I looked for answers on web pages, but to my surprise The web pages of bitcoin statistics only provide information about transaction fees, the number of pending transactions, market volumes and if some currency went up or down a lot. They do not care about the opinions of the people.

That's why I'm creating a web page, my idea is to be able to do polls with as many people as possible, and Im going to be as diverse as possible in age, nationality, culture and social status. All information is going to be free , my intention is that the statistics serves to everyone in a way you can have more information when you are making decisions.

The Internet was created under the premise of free and free information, but every time it was more difficult to find information that is not polarized or that does not try to justify something made of the market. For example, statistics on bitcoin speculation in China become very difficult to do without resources. My intention is to provide raw statistics, I give the numbers, you interpret them as you want. Also you well be able to subscribe to a FREE newslatter where you can find the statistics of the month

If you want to help me you can do it in several ways: 1) Fill out this survey https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vfT84BFMHoKndg3Dd9B4kD7ABOW6XKXE0nFoMCPrt2s/edit

2) After viewing the survey model, you can write in the comments what information do you like to find on the page.

3) If you think its a good idea and you like to get involved in some kind of way (doing the traslation ,doing the web page with me ,getting the surveys or just promoting the site please write in the comments).",1518179836,09/02/2018 12:37:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wd5fz/need_help_with_a_bitcoin_statistics_page_im_doing/,7

Accepting BTC payment on our e-commerce Jewellery store,"Hi All, 

Pleased to announce that in the name of adoption and pushing the technology forward we have now started accepting BTC payments through BitPay on our e-commerce store, which sells Jewellery in the EU. 

I know there's a lot of differing opinions on the environmental sustainability of BTC, it's transaction times and processing fees etc, but we feel that if everyone stops using it, the technology will grind to a halt altogether and never progress. 

This is the first time we've experimented with accepting digital currency, I wrote a brief tutorial about how people can pay on our store with BTC, but if I've missed anything or if there's any other considerations you think I'll have missed, please let me know below! Currently we are limited to $100 worth of BTC per day...

PS: As this is a trial, we're offering 10% off anyone who pays in BTC using the discount code 'BITPAY10' at checkout, as an incentive for allowing us to trial this payment method and iron out any issues - Mods please let me know if this isn't allowed to be posted here.

What do you think would happen if someone embedded some illegal data on the blockchain?,"This is kind of a ""shower thought"" post so don't take this too seriously.

As most of you know you can, in kind of a roundabout way, embed arbitrary data in the Bitocin blockchian so what would happen if for example someone embedded something like child porn or some highly classified government data, and also make the public aware of it so everybody can access it?

How hard do you think the officials would come down on Bitcoin?

Lending in a Sound Money based economy,"I have been thinking for a while now how an economy would function under a sound money standard and one of the matters that troubled me was lending. I initially thought that access to loaned capital would be very difficult, due to the reasons described bellow, but it turns out that this is only one side of the coin. 

My conclusion is the following: If the economy is expected to grow in the upcoming years, lending becomes more difficult. On the contrary if depression is expected, lending becomes easier. 

Why is that: If the economy grows, the same amount of money corresponds to a greater amount of real wealth, so the value of one currency unit increases and the prices fall. This makes it more difficult for businesses to accumulate the amount of capital needed to repay their loans. Only the best businesses would be able to do it. So, the lenders have greater incentive not to borrow because this currency induced risk is high and because their capital is appreciated in value anyway. If on the contrary the economy shrinks, the value of the currency decreases and prices increase, making it easier for a business to accumulate the loaned capital. The lenders have greater incentive to make loans since the currency induced risk is lower and because their capital is depreciated in value anyway. 

This leads to the following outcome: Easier access to money during depression periods, harder access during growth. The former tends to promote growth, the later tends to impede growth. Overall these mechanics tend to keep the economic environment less volatile, decreasing the absolute values of maximums and minimums. 

Easy access to capital during depression periods tends to increase economic activity to bring the economy back in track, so I assume that this is a positive characteristic. Difficult access to capital during growth periods tends to impede further growth. This can be a controversial characteristic and is the one that I’m mostly concerned about. It might not be negative in the long term though because it can prevent unsustainable or bubble-like growths, usually followed by sharp falls and depression periods. 

In a fiat money based economy the difficulty of capital access is controlled by the central banks with their interest rate policy and their ability to create new money. They have the responsibility to act or react, in order to achieve the desired outcome. There are no embedded mechanics in this case. An external actor has to act. In a sound money based economy, where no new money is created at will, the difficulty of capital access depends mainly on the currency’s value and the mechanics that adjust the difficulty are embedded in the system.

Any thoughts, remarks, suggestions or insights would be much appreciated.",1518185967,09/02/2018 14:19:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wdpj2/lending_in_a_sound_money_based_economy/,2

Secured.fyi – Ranking the most secure and private software tools (including Bitcoin),"Hi hoodlers!

As the title suggests, I made this tool that ranks the most secure and private email, backup, VPN, cryptos and communication software :)

It's all based on a Google Sheet, which updates the website automatically when the spreadsheet changes: https://secured.fyi/edit

Couldn’t find a good comparison overview like this, and want to see if enough people are interested in it, because I would like to spend more time on expanding the data set, and add more categories.

I wrote a medium post here that goes more in detail on how and why it was made: https://medium.com/@fredrikaurdal/secured-fyi-ranking-the-most-secure-and-private-software-tools-how-i-created-a-powerful-ranking-1f8a37913169

Currently, Bitcoin is ranking #8, but if there are compelling arguments for bumping up the ranking, and the community supports it, changes will be made. And also, I might add a some kind of overview that shows users features in the roadmap somehow.

Coinbase Transfers,"Coinbase has started doing something interesting I find shady. I'll just use figures to illustrate the point. 

You have $100 in btc you want to send. When you copy the the wallet address of where you want the btc transferred, it subtracts the transfer fee from the amount you own. However, it does not subtract the transfer fee from the amount you want to send. So for the example say a $10 transfer fee. So it looks like:

Amount you have: $90
Amount wanting to send: $100 

It subtracts the $10 from the amount you now have (after the transfer fee) but not from the original $100. So, everytime you want to send btc, it doesn't allow you because you ""don't have that much btc in your account to send."" It will then ask you to use a smaller amount. So if I cut it down and transfer $50, it works fine. It either doesn't allow you to send out so it can hold your btc or makes you break it into multiple transactional fees. Found that interesting.

Checked my Coinbase account I made and realized I had some Bitcoin!,"Super long story short, around November 2016 I was using a strange mining service called Suchflex that got shut down, and my first big pay out was the day it shutdown. I thought I never got paid due to that and since I was demoralized due to the service shutting down, I never checked my account. I checked last night and found that I have 0.0154 in Bitcoin. I received that in November 2016, so that was about $11.65 worth of bitcoin at the time, as a full bitcoin was worth roughly $760 at that point. I don’t still have a ton of bitcoin but I’m fucking excited that I found I have made a major gain with the bitcoin I didn’t even realize I had.",1518191782,09/02/2018 15:56:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wecet/checked_my_coinbase_account_i_made_and_realized_i/,46

[Serious] Is encouraging others to deal in BTC unethical by r/bitcoin's standards?,"After reading the post on the man convincing his barber to accept BTC I had the following thought:

1) r/bitcoin members regularly state that you should never put more into BTC than you are willing to lose. This is a nod to the inherent current hourly instability.

2) Encouraging small business owners/regular non-BTC people to accept BTC as a payment may be fatal if the market crashes. Such business may not be able to hodl to the next bull run due to operating expenses.

Therefore, encouraging such payment forms as BTC, at this juncture, for regular business to groups which are not in a position to risk potential losses would be unethical as they would then be putting up ""more than they are willing to lose"". Thoughts?

BTC tax question,"
1) Do we need to report gain or loss for transaction between coins?

2) For the FBAR, it is only for the oversea holding right? So if I have some holdings in GDAX (only purchased, more than $10k, never sold), holdings in Bitstamp (purchased more than $10k and never sold, and it is outside USA), and holdings in Ledger Nano S (transferred from Bitstamp, GDAX and some other platforms, more than $10k, do not even know it should be deemed as domestic or oversea). Do I need to report the holding amount for each one of the three holdings or only the Bitstamp?

3) If I have transferred from one platform to another address, such as from Bitstamp to Ledger Nano S, not sell, do I need to report gain or loss. For example I purchased one BTC at $3000, transferred it to Ledger Nano S when it is $6000. Does it count as one transaction?

4) If I hold them more than one year and then sell, can I enjoy the long term capital gain with better tax rate instead of short term sell treated as common income? 

Thanks guys!",1518194181,09/02/2018 16:36:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wemto/btc_tax_question/,0
"Market Cap is moving UP again, stay informed with CMC Alert app","**Today Last hours statistics:** https://imgur.com/a/zdy32

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem:**
  Every time when there are big fluctuations in the Coin Market Cap, most of the coins are going UP or DOWN in the same way. Be informed and act accordingly (for example, when it goes DOWN: you can move into other stable currencies or withdraw; etc.)
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
**Recommendation:**
  I recommend you the **CMC Alert** app, as it gives you the information that you need regarding the Coin Market Cap in a user friendly way, it's simple, efficient and FREE. CMC Alert uses the official Web API from coinmarketcap.com.
Why should you use it:
 
+ It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there

- It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.
 
- Can **Set Alarms** and **Aggressive Alarm mode**(optional) - perfect when you want to be awake during nights
 
* It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.
 
Google Play link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.companyname.CMCAlert .
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
It helps me everyday, why not try it yourself! It's also free. Cheers :)",1518194365,09/02/2018 16:39:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wenoe/market_cap_is_moving_up_again_stay_informed_with/,8

Question about trading bitcoin.,"I've been looking to get in and buy bitcoin for the past few months and have done my best to understand everything about the buying and selling. I was thinking of buying in really soon as it seems the market has leveled after the drop but as far as buying and selling goes, is it worth it to trade on a daily basis based off of the daily highs and lows or would it be better to buy and just hold on for 20+k again. Is it worth it to buy in then sell a few hours later when it goes up $500 then buy back in when I drop a few hours later?",1518195332,09/02/2018 16:55:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wes3i/question_about_trading_bitcoin/,1

If I use a cold address to buy something will I lose any unspent bitcoin?,My knowledge of bitcoin so far is that when you do a transaction the total amount of bitcoin in an address gets spent and then you receive change back? So if I only have one address and send someone 50 out of 100 BTC then what would really happen is that 100 BTC go to that person and I get back 0 because I have no new address to use? Or would it all go to the miner as some BTC needs to be sent to the miner for network fee?,1518201203,09/02/2018 18:33:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wfil8/if_i_use_a_cold_address_to_buy_something_will_i/,1

I just transferred some Bitcoin... it's not that bad?,"I originally bought my first small amount of BTC about 8 months ago, I was fascinated. I was researching about crypto all day, and with time I slowly left BTC behind and entered the world of alts. I ended up selling my BTC and was all in alts for a long period.

I bought another small amount when BTC was at 13k and sold at 19k, all this inside my exchange which was charging ridiculous fees for a BTC withdrawal, the mempool was full 24/7 and everything was slow. That is a fact, BTC was slow and expensive to move around.

Well today I bought BTC for the third time (because I just want to own a part of history) and out of curiosity I checked the withdrawal page on my exchange and it said it would charge 6 MXN (around 0.3 USD). I transacted and it confirmed in around 5-10 minutes. This may be because the network is not clogged, but paying 6 pesos for a transaction is not *that* bad, in fact not bad at all, yes I have faster and cheaper coins but we're talking about the biggest, globally known crypto: Bitcoin

I just checked on blockchain.info and it says the transactions were sent with ""10 sat/byte"", I've heard people who say you can send it with even lower fee but my exchange of course won't let me do that.

That's all I have to say, sorry for bashing you so much for the last 6 months, Bitcoin. All this left me thinking why on earth Bitcoin Cash even exists? A BCH and BTC transaction probably feel the same right now.

edit: for the record, my exchange [implemented Segwit](https://blog.bitso.com/comisiones-din%C3%A1micas-para-env%C3%ADos-de-bitcoin-c3f4e4afea) in September 2017

Please don't use LN MainNet! You're doing more harm than good!,"Please don't use lightning ~~main that~~ Mainnet, because the more that you use lightning, the more resistant to change the network is going to be. Developers are still continuing to work on lightning, and this means that if you continue using it on the EDIT (Voice typing fail) ~~main that~~ Mainnet, then it will be next to impossible to change without a fork. Then there will be limited changes that are possible. If too many people use lightning, and then the developers want to change something that breaks the existing lightning my neck, then you are going to have issues with the lightning network not having consensus. It's very important that people let the developers do their thing, and try not to use lightning mainnet. It's okay to use her on client, but especially if you are accepting payment, please don't use it.

We want the developers to continue working on it without being Limited in what changes they can do now.

Fees are so low right now, it's not really a big deal. Lightning is going to be great, but you can get by with just segwit for now.

Pools not mining low fees,"It has been discussed here a bit, but i just did some simple math via www.blockchair.com and since block height 507000 there have been 59 blocks that are not full.  Those blocks add up to ~27.6MB, and that is around 31MB of block space.  (I am using 1MB on the assumption that most of the 1sat/byte transactions are not SegWit to get the worst case) if these pools were to remove the minimums, the pool would currently be empty.

[Blockchair link with filter](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=size\(300..998000\),id\(507000..\))

[Johoe's mempool graph](https://dedi.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#8h)

the pools and count come as no surprise:
* AntPool	28

* F2Pool	21

* Bitcoin.com	4

* BitFury	4

* 58COIN	2

and since antpool and bitcoin.com mine 1sat/byte transactions on bcash, they are just being jerks.  I found this annoying an informative, but if you are a miner in any of these pools, i suggest you either contact them and ask them to change, or you switch to any other pool that mines low fees, slush is one i know for certain does, but i am sure you guys can make your own recommendations

We have decided to embrace the Cryptocurrencies revolution!,"Hey guys, first of all we’d like to say hi to the community since we are “noobies” to Reddit and to Cryptoland in general. I’ll start with the happy story. We are an international online English-Spanish Spanish-English translation service that have been in business for the last 15 years. Recently we were contacted by a customer who asked us if we took payment in cryptocurrencies. As you can imagine, we were left scratching our heads and our first thought was “Say that again? What the hell is he talking about?” as we didn’t know much about cryptocurrencies and how to charge for our work with them. But being eager to please we decided to investigate further and we are so thankful that we did! We have started taking payment for our work in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin a month ago and our workload has increased by 50%, we wish we had looked into it sooner. We believe we are one of the first people in our country and in this business sector to accept this form of payment and we just wanted to give a thumbs up to the community for making this revolution possible.

Here’s a rundown of the type of things we do: proofreading, CV’s, cover letters, books, transcriptions, publicity and ads, product catalogues, university thesis and articles, press releases, personal documents, blogs, web pages, manuals, flyers and leaflets, contracts, certificates, film scripts and subtitles, emails, technical reports, etc.

So if you or anybody that you know think that you might need this type of service you can always contact us at: flashlingua@gmail.com and we’ll welcome you with open arms. You don’t have to be from a specific country as we work globally.

Thanks in advance for the upvotes :-) and we’ll try to get back to let you know how it is all going. TO THE MOON!

An important aspect of cryptos that I think many over look...,"It seems like they are uncorrelated assets. In other words, they are not affected by a stock market crash. Many investment firms wrote bitcoin off because of its volatility, but now they’re realizing they can put a small percentage of their investments in it to partially offset any crashes in the stock market. Not only are cryptos proving to be uncorrelated, but more often than not, they actually have an inverse relationship. When stocks start to crash, people flock to cryptos and the price goes up. My prediction is that firms will start using cryptos in their portfolio as leverage and this will drive the price up to astronomical numbers. Even if it’s just 3% of their investment going into cryptos, that’s a lot of money if it’s a big firm or a hedge fund. If/when institutional money starts to come in, we will truly see how high bitcoin can go. Until then, I hope everyone can see through the short term volatility and think long term.

Is investing in Bitcoin like investing in art?,"I was listening to [this podcast](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/02/09/584555705/episode-823-planet-monet) about how people invest in art and they don't do anything with it -- they don't hang it on walls, it just sits in storage -- in the hopes that the art's value will go up. Since appreciation for art is entirely subjective, it sort of made me think about Bitcoin. The ""free ports"" here in this story are just like your secure BTC wallets you disconnect from the internet and don't touch. The prices for art are booming -- people are buying art and then locking it away.

Stocks aren't a good comparison to BTC because you can say with stocks you're getting a piece of a company that provides a service and makes money, which BTC doesn't. Fiat money isn't a good comparison either because, yeah it's just a piece of paper, but it's backed by the government and has guaranteed value. But art, that feels like a good comparison to BTC in some ways. I still have a lot of doubts and questions about Bitcoin, but you see investments that inherently feel illogical all over, like with investing in art or wine. Things become worth money just because people say so. That's what makes BTC's value so fascinating to me.",1518213267,09/02/2018 21:54:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wgy8c/is_investing_in_bitcoin_like_investing_in_art/,1

Question about what people can see in my BTC wallet when I sent them BTC or they send me BTC.,"I have a Trezor.

I have 1 BTC account in there.

If I send someone BTC from that account, or if I give them an address for which they can send BTC to me in that account - 

Can they see everything that is in that account of mine (using a blockchain explorer or whatever)?

Or can they ONLY see everything that has gone in and out of  that one address they used to send to me, or the one address I used to send to them?

Anotherwords, if I change address for every send and receive transaction into my BTC wallet account, does that prevent people from seeing the contents of the entire account?

Newby bitcoin miner here with some questions.,"If this is not the most efficient Subreddit, I welcome the redirection and am happy to oblige.

Recently I learned that my gaming rig's GPU is an adequate GPU for a beginner bitcoin miner, not that I would make a fortune, but it's a good start and I would like to give this a try. The Asus Rog Strix Gtx 1080 Ti is what's in my rig. I have a few questions I'd like to know the answers to before I start downloading software. So as to reduce time spent in error, in your opinion (if possible please use references) what is the most efficient software profitability wise to use? Will the GPU be able to run games (PUBG, WoW) while it mines? I plan on mining BTC, but feel free to spread knowledge on whether it's more efficient to mine something else (given my set up, it may not be, I've read). 

Some questions in my concern regarding the future prospect of building a new rig for mining or adding on to my current one:
My Mobo has two more PCI-E slots, but what about SLI? Does that matter? Do GPU's have to be SLI in order to be compatible together in mining BTC?
What is the minimum RAM requirement?

Lastly, a technical question:
I currently run my CPU at 100% minimum processor state. This means it is always running at full power. Will changing it back to it's default setting (5%) be less efficient when it comes to the mining operation?",1518229270,10/02/2018 02:21:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wimhf/newby_bitcoin_miner_here_with_some_questions/,1

Lambo is to FiatMoney as Tesla is to Cryptocurrency,"There are a lot of memes about new age crypto millionaires buying Lambos. That is soooo wrong!
Come on guys, have some class! Move into the electronic age! Spend your newfound wealth on a futuristic electric car, not a gas burning dinosaur.
There are something like 2000 moving parts in a Lambo engine, and about 30 in a Tesla! 
The electric car is simplicity incarnate - No squirting gasoline into cylinders and crazy pistons smashing up and down, no gearboxes, no clutch, no oil cooler, no exhaust, no fumes, no pollution.
Electronic, programmable, software controlled devices rule the world, and hardware is the dumb commodity item that the software controls.
If a Lambo is Hardware, then a Telsa is Software - its the difference between a $100 note and programmable money. Which do you think the future will favor?

Takeoff is imminent,"In 1876 economists and mathematicians theorised the existence of a economic-ecosystem that had reached a form of transcendence - creating an endless positive feedback loop. They proposed that such a system entering this state would begin what they called the Golden Bull Run. Various mathematical models were created to show what this Golden Bull Run would look like.

Through my PhD research I believe cryptocurrency may be entering the early stages of a Golden Bull Run. In this stage early investors could potentially earn an endless supply of wealth - as the system generates tangible wealth rather than just moving it around.

Economists believed that the slow nature of the stock market meant that harmful players could sabotage the emergence of the Golden Bull Run before it could get started. However it looks like the extremely fast paced nature of cryptocurrency means it is not susceptible to these types of attacks.

If I am right we could see something never before experienced in the history of the universe. Hold on while you can - takeoff is imminent.",1518246758,10/02/2018 07:12:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wk1d9/takeoff_is_imminent/,25

Warning about Changelly (I think Ive been scammed),"I just want to post a warning to anyone considering using Changelly. My advice is avoid them.
5 days ago I tried to convert BTC to an altcoin and after waiting for 24 hours I received a message saying my transfer had failed. I also received an email saying I needed to send personal ID to the Changelly security team. 

I have sent multiple emails to the general customer support requesting details about when I will receive my funds back and I have received a couple of responses, but they wont give me a straight answer and just keep repeating that everything will be fine and Ill get my funds 'soon'.  

I have also emailed the security team l but I am yet to get a response from them. 

I posted about this on on the Changelly subreddit here: np.reddit.com/r/Changelly/comments/7vr6zj/changelly_sorry_the_transaction_was_not_completed/  

u/changelly_tom wont respond to my post despite me calling on him to comment several times.  

There are currently several people experiencing the same problem who have posted on the Changelly subreddit including one guy who says he has been waiting 25 days for his funds!!! 

I see that others have been in this situation over the last couple of months and have eventually received their funds after waiting days or weeks.. I guess that's cause for optimism.. but to be honest, the whole thing is beginning to feel really scammy to me, I'm not sure I am going to get my funds back here. And even if I do.. Changelly have cost me literally thousands of dollars in lost revenue. With the movement in the market over the last few days, if I had received my transfer in a timely fashion I stood to gain thousands of dollars. Now I have no idea if they will process the transaction (if so at what exchange rate? It better NOT be the current rate) or will they refund me?  

And theres no response on reddit and only feeble replies via the customer support. 

If you are considering using Changelly I would serious consider alternatives!!! I think they have scammed me. ",1518247285,10/02/2018 07:21:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wk2j2/warning_about_changelly_i_think_ive_been_scammed/,8

Every time the charts keep climbing there are mostly spitefulness posts regarding FUDrs on all crypto sites.

In my opinion this is one of the reasons why the whole market is volatile as hell.

Two months on coin base are fucking me still,"So two months ago I set up the process to withdraw from them.. sent the payment to link banks etc and about a month in nothing had changed. Rang their support and they said “oh no!! We will pass it on to our specialist team” low be hold a month later nothing has changed and when I contacted them the other day they hung up on me when I demanded it be fixed. 

Two days later I saw a video on twitter with someone who had the EXACT same problem and he vidoed himself ringing them and they said the EXACT same thing to him..

Any interest in learning how to hedge Bitcoin and other major coins.,"I’ve been trading over the last 10 years, traded my way through the GFC including the dow Jones industrial average when volatility was at its peak and 10% losses in one session was the norm.  I’ve learnt some very valuable skills along the way, one of these skills is how to hedge your losses when you hold an asset and that asset is in sharp decline and, appears to be crashing.  I currently hold crypto myself and I have recently used these skills to ensure that my holdings, and my capital, was always protected throughout the recent downturn.  I don’t like to see anyone lose their money or go through the stress of a major sell off, and I feel that many investors could benefit from having this ability and peace of mind.

Would there be any interest from this community in knowing how to secure your capital and/or profits in the event of another downturn?  I was considering doing a couple of explanatory YouTube videos. 

TLDR;  want to know if anyone is interested in learning how to protect your money during a sell off 




UPDATE: Hi, thanks everyone for the replies.  It seems that there is quite a bit of interest in this, I understand that yes one technique during a selloff is simply to HODL, but I know from personal experience that it's much less stressful knowing your money is safe no matter how low the price goes.  I'm not a financial adviser nor do I claim to be one, but I feel that this is something that could benefit others.  I'll aim to have my first video up in a weeks time and i'll post it here.",1518266393,10/02/2018 12:39:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wl7vy/any_interest_in_learning_how_to_hedge_bitcoin_and/,124

Experimenting Bitcoin / Cryptocurrencies use in Asia - Tip or advice welcome 🙏,"Last year, I experimented the use of bitcoin during a payment race, which consisted of 5 people travelling with each one single payment method to travel from Toronto to Las Vegas in 6 days. Rule was simple the first to arrive and complete all daily challenges win. 
I was using Bitcoin and won. 
Now in March, I am going again on the race, this time from Hong Kong to Singapore in 5 days, the landscape for bitcoin has changed dramatically, and I am here to ask if any of you would have any advice or know what the landscape is like for Bitcoin acceptance/ use in Asia, and if there is anything that would be great to know.. apart from how to speak Chinese 😜.

Anyone claiming that SegWit makes it unnecessary to keep signatures does not have any idea how SegWit works.,"The segregated signatures are still all included in the blocks. They are just accounted for differently towards the 1MB block size limit.

The types of posts on here:,"Posts on r/bitcoin fall into these categories... SORTED HIGH TO LOW VALUE:

HIGH VALUE:

1) TECHNICAL INNOVATION - articles describing (and debating) ideas and efforts to improve and scale the Bitcoin ecosystem and protocol. This can also be help/how-to posts sharing tools &amp; utilities to be private and secure.

2) NEWS - events which affect ecosystem like hacks or attacks (regulatory or physical), or major adoptions. Please note there is a difference between #2 &amp; #4. E.g- Dimon or Buffet spewing FUD are #4, and are not newsworthy.

3) IDEAS - Insightful articles. And yes, memes are ideas too (there are low and high quality memes however). Ideas, economics, and philosophy are important aspects of Bitcoin... much more so than yesterday/tomorrow's price.

LOW VALUE:

4) PUMP/FUD - quoting articles ""will reach $X by 2018"", or rumors of bans and govt musings. Or attacking FUDsters. No, this is not news... it's hype, speculation, or spite by people promoting their long or short positions.

5) PRICE ANNOUNCEMENTS - We can all check the price ourselves. NEW RULE: Rollercoaster Guy is only acceptable at $5k increments, and only $10k increments above $50k/btc, and only $50k increments above $500k/BTC, and only $100k increments above $1M/BTC.

6) YOUR TXN - ""I'm cashing out"", ""I got my first 0.1"" nobody really cares. The exception is if you have an exceptional war story of gain or loss (i.e. your mom threw out laptop with 10k coins), which qualify as #1 or #2 (helpful advice and lessons learned). Tax related posts also fall low here in #6, and belong on r/IRS or other bootlicker forums. Hodl.

Bitcoin is a battleground for war on China?,"Kindly give me a chance to express this hypothesis. We all know that there's a huge Chinese market for Bitcoin. Could it be possible that bull whales from the United States heavily manipulated the Bitcoin increase in prices last December to drag the Chinese traders to buy at 19k while all of the initial bulls sold all their coins early and literally reaped all the profits by converting to USD? In which case this is the first digital financial war to ever occur in history resulting in public and covert robbery that led the Chinese government to consider banning cryptocurrency? 

I'm not thinking about this just because I'm curious. I'm actually trying to understand what happened to speculate how the Chinese cryptocurrency market will respond in the near future and when the bullish trend reversal may occur and how from a political perspective.

While I don't have a large amount now, one day they could be worth a significant amount.

"After learning the minimum about Bitcoin, this is what I have come up with.","First off I don't claim to be an expert about Bitcoin. I simply want to know what others have to say about my thinking. 

1. Once big companies start allowing Bitcoin as a payment method, will the price will surge up? (I believe so. Higher demand and use for it.)

2. The government can't really impose regulations on Bitcoin? 
(I find it hard for them to do that unless they regulate the internet.)

3. We give value to money just like cryptocurrency, and the world is going paperless so it seems right that printed money will disappear. That means digital currency will take its place. Bitcoin already has a big advantage in that field.

So I have come to the conclusion that Bitcoin can't really go anywhere, and it's a good long term investment. 

Would love to hear a discussion about the points I listed 
and gain some other perspective!

Thanks",1518298978,10/02/2018 21:42:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wog2z/after_learning_the_minimum_about_bitcoin_this_is/,15

Visa and Mastercard have ordered Bitcoin vendors to change their Merchant Codes,"So with the recent news that banks are now charging cash fees for Bitcoin transactions, i wanted to get to the bottom of what is happening so i enquired with my bank and then a bitcoin selling platform to see what was up.

before i get slated on Reddit, to be clear i would use my credit card to buy during the dip and then repay over a couple of months (i don't rack up huge credit card debts by any-means)

Here is the extract from emails i have received from both my bank and also Bittylicious (crypto buying platform)

-----------------------------

Reply from Santander Bank:

Date: 09/02/2018

Thank you for your phone call on 08/02/2018 and telling us about your concerns.

Summary of your complaint -
You let us know that you were unhappy regarding cash transactions fee which has been applied to payments made to Bittylicious for purchase on Bitcoin. Despite making the transaction on numerous occasions previously you have never incurred a charge.

I have now have the opportunity to fully review your concerns and I am sorry for any inconvenience which you feel has been caused.

As discussed I have referred this issue across to our subject matter experts so this can be reviewed in more depth. It has now been identified that the merchant code for the transaction has been amended from 16/1-6012 (Financial Institutions -Merchandise and service) to 28/1 6051 (Financial Institutions –Foreign currency, Money orders, travellers cheques).

This basically means that transaction for the purchase of Bitcoin are now classed as a cash purchase and will therefore be subject to cash fees. On reviewing this further to determine whether it was Santander who have made this amended it has been identified that it is the merchant and their acquirer that choose the merchant code.

-------------------------------

Reply from Bittylicious:

Hi,

Visa and Mastercard have forced all crypto sellers to change their Merchant Code (MCC) to 6051.

This is indeed counted as ""quasi cash"" and some credit card providers are charging cash advance fees and interest on this. However, this choice is nothing to do with us; banks can choose of their own according whether to charge these extra fees or not. Sadly, many do (Barclays certainly and now, with your confirmation, Santander) but they are under no obligation to do so and we do not benefit from this in any way whatsoever.

We have a warning on the purchasing pages saying that we strongly recommend using a debit card because of this.

Thanks,

Bittylicious | Support Ticket System Team,

EDIT: there’s seems to be a lot of posts expressing their view on buying bitcoin or any crypto with a credit card is bad news and to just buy with cash, whilst I agree that getting into debt to invest is madness this post wasn’t really about how people manage their finances it’s about what the system is doing to challenge and push people away!

This wasn’t the situation a few weeks ago, it’s just been mandated by VISA and MasterCard to merchants",1518299618,10/02/2018 21:53:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7woif6/visa_and_mastercard_have_ordered_bitcoin_vendors/,122

My experience with coinbase (Not good),"Hi,

So a few months ago (Around October) I finally decided to have a look at btc and invest a little and see what happened. After only investing a small sum (For me) and making a little profit before the big climb to £15k I decided to invest a larger sum. I made a little bit more and decided to call it quits already.

I went about verifying my account on coinbase depositing a small amount of EUR to verify my bank. Unfortunately I deposited under the amount needed (Never detailed the required amount) and so had to do it again and therefore was charged double the transfer fee (Pain in the ass more than anything).

After about 1 week after the deposit entered my account I attempted to withdraw my balance presuming my bank was verified. It was not. I got into contact with coinbase who replied quickly asking me to ensure my bank was eligible to be verified which I did and informed me my case was handed over to a specialist. This is where things went down hill. 

I replied back to the email stating my account was all good and everything was fine to be verified. A week late. Nothing. I emailed again over a week later stating my account was still unverifed and had had no contact from this so-called specialist. 10 days after my reply they finally got back to me. They told me it can take a few days from when I first tried to verify my bank. It had already taken around 14... the email said to reply if it hadn't been resolved so that's what I did, again stating my account was still not verified.

11 days later I got a reply saying again the same old stuff... another link to check my account was eligible. Another message to ignore this email if it was resolved. Another promise to get back to me ASAP if not...

Luckily my account has now been verified... after a whole month...

I cannot stress this enough. As good as some of the recommendations for coinbase are, their service team seems completely incompetent. lying about specialists. Never giving a clear answer to your request. Stating the same links and lines from the previous email. Bullshit. Avoid them.

TL:DR Coinbase's customer response team gave me the run around for a whole month before verifying my bank account so I could finally withdraw my funds...

The email exchange:

What could fix Bitcoins technical issues?,"I'm a believer in Bitcoin in the long-term, I've been buying the dip and hoping it crashed even harder- I believe BTC is here to stay. It has the brand name, which matters, the longest established value of any of the coins (even doge). When Bitcoin tanks, they all tank- there wouldn't be a market without Bitcoin. 

But the issues with Bitcoin are real- slow transfer times and high transaction fees. Yes, Bitcoin can still be a ""store of value"" for the time being, but it can't stay that way forever. 

So, how can these problems get fixed? Is there anything on the drawing board?",1518317249,11/02/2018 02:47:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wq82m/what_could_fix_bitcoins_technical_issues/,0
Increasing trend in credit cards: surcharges for using a credit card.,"I visited a store today that charged an additional 4% on checkout when using a credit card.  (Did not apply to debit cards or cash)

At first, it got under my skin.  Some gas stations have been offering a ""cash discount"" for some time, and that always struck me as annoying...

But, as a BTC holder, I think this trend could actually be good.  As more and more people are compelled to actually pay to use credit cards, and the price for products is divorced from the price of payment processing, people will see the value of crypto all the more.

Here's on article detailing the changes, and court cases that have enabled this.  State by state legislation comes into play, as well...

"My Lawsuit w. Coinbase, Inc.","My Lawsuit with Coinbase, Inc.
Before I begin, I would like to state that I figured out most of my information AFTER the issue occurred.
On Aug 26th I proceeded to make a transaction between Poloniex and Coinbase. My primary goal was to transfer $4,300.00 in USDT. 
I visited the Coinbase website and went to the USD Wallet (tab) and started to look for my Bitcoin address to transfer my funds. 
Most of you are already picking up what is going on now. USDT [Tether] is not supported by Coinbase. You are correct.
I went to the USD wallet (tab) and pressed ‘Deposit’ with the options of Bank Deposit or Wire Transfer. Nothing that I needed was showing up. I proceeded to click on the 3 dots (…) shown on the side where I was given a few more options, one of the options were generating a Bitcoin Address, which is what I thought I was looking for.
Next, I proceeded to take the funds from the generated address and finish up the transaction. Receiving address went to where Poloniex asked to put it, then pressed send.
I realized something happened when I received only .13 cents in BTC. The rest of my Tether are delivered when viewing the OMNIWALLET.ORG website. 
I asked emailed every party involved in any way. I emailed Tether, OMNIWALLET, Coinbase, as well as Poloniex. 
I was told that the funds can be imported to OMNIWALLET by using the PRIVATE KEYS. Unfortunately, as you all know, Coinbase strips you naked by not providing their users with their rightful private keys. But, on their Multi-Sig [multiple signature] wallet they do. 
I proceeded to file a small claims lawsuit at my local courthouse. Fast forward 3 months, I had my hearing. Coinbase cried about how their engineering resource will take up to ‘2.3 Million Dollars’ for their, overpaid – under experienced, software engineers to help me gain access back to my funds. The Coinbase rep also fled behind their Terms of Service stating that they don’t accept Tether as a form of currency. 
Judge Cortez was even more useless as her final decision was in favor of Coinbase because of their Terms of Service. I say she was useless because she never took the time to review my claim as I clearly stated I was suing for “Fraudulent misrepresentation on behalf of Coinbase and their website.”
One of these magical software engineers came to visit me during our mediation process, explaining to me that the feature, the reason why I was even able to generate a BTC address in the USD wallet was because of a ‘feature’ for merchants. This very ‘feature’ is the reason why people, myself included, have lost their holdings. This ‘feature’ is what caused me to throw my portfolio in the trash. The Coinbase rep explained that this was nothing but ‘user error.’ That statement blew my mind. I tried to explain to him that the website shouldn’t be up if there is ever room for ‘USER ERROR’S.’ When have any of you accidentally made a payment on WellsFargo.com or accidentally sent money to an acquaintance via PayPal. Never, these websites are tested repeatedly to make sure there is NO user error. 
I was suing because of how I was able to generate a BTC address through the USD wallet tab, they changed ‘user error’ to a ‘merchant feature.’ The overpaid engineers are not capable of accessing my private keys because its going to take 2.3 million in resources, although we all know Coinbase made 1B+ in the year of 2017. Instead, all they did was update their website to NOW show the warning “please do not send USDT to this address.” Instead of helping customers retrieve funds from their website that clearly has a bigger hole than they expected, they just hide behind their terms and conditions and put up a warning on their website. 
I am not writing this to bash on Coinbase, although they deserve every lawsuit that comes on their desk, I am writing this, so everyone takes their money out of Coinbase and onto a wallet provider where you do have access to your Private Keys. If I had access to my private keys I would have been able to access everything the same day of the issue. If Coinbase’s website didn’t allow me to make a BTC address on a USD wallet tab, regardless of the ‘feature’ I would have had no choice to send the funds using BTC ETH or LTC. 
Just keep your private keys, guys. Learn from my mistake. I knew I wasn’t gonging to win this case, but I wanted to prove my point. People are losing money and Coinbase calls it a ‘feature’ 
Here is the destination address. If anyone can hack into it, go for it, I can’t do anything with the money anymore, be my guest.

"Urgent request: research interview for PhD, information on why you got into Bitcoin and Crypto, what your experiences are and what your views are","Hi everyone. I'm looking for people to help me with some academic research on the social impact of bitcoin and blockchain systems, and how you interact with them. I'm in the early stages of a PhD and have to complete some exercises and practice interviews in order to progress my advancement.

These interviews will not be published or end up in any reports, but are more of a preliminary research exploration in preparation for the full research project investigating the culture and social dimensions of cryptocurrency tech. This will help my understanding, and help me structure a robust project which will be able to receive funding from research commissions.

I'd appreciate anyone's help as all your views are very valuable, and hope that my PhD will be of benefit in understanding and developing the future of cryptocurrencies. However, if you're any of the following, this would also be a massive help: 
* people who have created new start-up businesses with an interest in fintech 
* people who started trading
* people applying these technologies internationally
* people who have attended community-type meetings that you'd find on websites such as meetup.com

edit to add: * people who just have an interest but don't own anything

Happy to provide more information on request. Interview should be no more than half an hour, and I'd greatly appreciate your input and time. I'm hoping to carry out interviews within the next 48 hours.

"Coinbase Launches a PayPal Like Plugging For Ethereum, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin","
Coinbase, the biggest crypto broker and one of the biggest exchange, has launched a new service for merchants, allowing them to seamlessly integrate crypto payments by adding a Coinbase Commerce button, not much different than the PayPal button.

Unlike previously where their merchants service was directly integrated with Coinbase, requiring a Coinbase account, all you need now to make the payment is just crypto.

Coinbase has said little officially regarding the new service, with a bare website stating they are not open for new sign-ups, but some merchants are already using it, giving us the opportunity to test Coinbase Commerce.

Once you’ve selected whatever product and have gone through the checkout process, customers could face a screen like this:



As can be seen above, the crypto option seamlessly integrates, making it look no different than the other two established options.

We naturally clicked on Coinbase which, like PayPal, takes you out of the merchant’s environment to be met with a screen shown below:



The four options shown above are the four cryptos Coinbase has listed on their broker service and on their exchange.

Ethereum is shown first under a, we must say, nicer logo than the rest, betraying perhaps a slight bias on the part of Coinbase which, is no secret, has dedicated some considerable resources towards supporting the ethereum ecosystem.

Clicking on any of the four listed options instantly sends you to the final screen, a screen that might look somewhat familiar to cryptonians:



We pursued no further, but we presume once the payment is sent the website would redirect back to the merchant’s natural environment, just as it does with PayPal.

Nor did we have the MetaMask plugging installed. So it is unclear whether we would have just received a request for confirmation with the payment automatically made if MetaMask was in operation.

If that’s not the case, then it probably will be in due time because it significantly increases customers convenience as instead of copy pasting around you’d just click the MetaMask confirmation button and be done within a second.

Even without it, however, the experience is no worse than with PayPal or credit cards, although it is unclear how that 15 minutes payments time frame would work with bitcoin when it experiences sever backlogs.

With Bitcoin Cash, such problem might be unlikely because they could use first seen zero confirmed transactions as Coinbase used for bitcoin prior to 2014.

But it is really with eth, integrated with MetaMask, where the checkout experience could shine and be far more convenient than with either PayPal or a credit card.

That’s because in such integration, you would need not search for your wallet then enter all those numbers, nor would you need to copy paste crypto addresses, with the payment instead virtually instantly made as long as you have a sufficient balance on MetaMask.

That means BitPay might have quite some competition on their hands. They have been dragging for months now on Bitcoin Cash integration, without any indication of eth addition, while Coinbase is offering all of them, plus Litecoin on top.

BitPay is, however, bigger where merchants are concerned, with the last known number being some 100,000, while Coinbase has around 50,000, but Coinbase’s pioneering in the eth space, where many innovative projects are beginning to make a practical difference, might give them a significant edge.",1518334878,11/02/2018 07:41:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wrk5o/coinbase_launches_a_paypal_like_plugging_for/,4

Solving a block in a pool,"Well excuse me in advance if my question sounds funny. But I'm just curious perhaps someone can shed a light.

When in a pool of miners, let's say there are 100 miners connected to a single daemon node, do they solve every block together, concurrently computing, work is divided among miners? Or each miner solves the block individually, parallel?

To further elaborate, for example I got 100 machines, should I connect them all to a single daemon node to mine or it's better to let them mine with their own daemon node each?",1518335571,11/02/2018 07:52:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wrlpy/solving_a_block_in_a_pool/,2
"After the Bitgrail scandal, every exchange needs to have proper wallets with private keys","As the title says.  After the Bitgrail scandal. Every exchange  need to have proper wallets with  private keys.

This needs to not just happen through the websites but also through apps like Binance or KuCoin app. 

A simplified user-friendly way to keep your funds secure while not trading yet easy enough to transfer back and forth without all the hassle

These exchanges should offer minimal if any fees to transfer to real wallets they provide. 

Many people simply knave their coins on exchanges simply due to the hassle and fees.  

This will not only benefit uses but also the exchanges..

This NEEDS to  happen!

Not for trading purpose but for the purpose of  conveniently storing your coins safely while not actively trading. People use exchanges and keep their coins on there simply becausw they don't know better or out of convenience.

Please critique my Bitcoin paper wallet strategy - Looking for advice on security and fee minimization,"I've spent a good chunk of today setting up hot wallets, verifying accounts, and transferring small amounts of Bitcoin (0.0001 BTC) to and from paper wallets.  I think I have a good strategy in place for securing my funds offline, but I could use some input before jumping in and and depositing larger amounts.  Questions I would like answered:

1) Is this strategy reasonably secure?  My goal is to hold all of my Bitcoin until the market reaches a good point, then sell the majority of it.  

2) How can I minimize the fees associated with withdrawing from the paper wallet?  I know that Blockchain allows users to alter the priority of their transactions.  Are there other ways, such as alternative exchanges or wallets that I should look into? 

3) Should I keep relatively small amounts of Bitcoin on the exchanges for selling quickly?  Or is the risk not worth it?


**My strategy for depositing funds into paper wallet:**

1) The balance in my NiceHash wallet is transferred to CoinBase account (free)

2) CoinBase balance is transferred to GDAX account (free) 

4) Generate paper wallet on an offline computer using the BitCoin Paper Wallet generator

3) GDAX balance is withdrawn to the paper wallet (free), paper wallet stored in safe spot until needed

4) Once a paper wallet reaches ~$100, I will generate a new one and deposit future funds into the new wallet.  I figure this will minimize the chance I lose everything due to stupidity.  



**My strategy for withdrawing funds:**

1) Sweep the paper wallet into my Blockchain.info account using the private key (charges a fee)

2) Transfer the Blockchain.info balance into my GDAX account (charges a fee)

3) Sell on GDAX for $$$",1518338813,11/02/2018 08:46:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wrsc0/please_critique_my_bitcoin_paper_wallet_strategy/,6

With apologies to Mark Twain,"It was a driving, vigorous population of hodlers and cypherpunks. It was an *optimistic* population. It was the *only* population of this kind the world has ever seen, and ever would see. A moment in time where the networks were reliable enough to hash on a global scale. For observe, this population wielded an assemblage of some millions of compute devices, processing units, hydro-powered and thermo-powered machines filling cavernous spaces. They did not use cobbled together garage boxes — although it began there, was once that, but only shortly — but rather a vast *latticework* of *real* machinery, arithmetic logic units, illusory code, computational grunts. This population was not lace-gloved, finicky. It was young and hearty and bright-eyed in the face of pessimistic greybeards. Creating etherial ledgers from nothing, keeping them alive cryptographically, mining the greater hashes, collision resistance, building a technocratic foundation for a world to come. And then came the charlatans. See the Altucher, thin lipped, brillo hair. He wears a smile that cannot be placed, lives in machine learned advertisements, speaks of riches founded on no real logic, quotes equations of dubious origin. Others of his ilk. The imbeciles: Grande frappachino wielding Karpelès. The connectors of bits, snake-eyed, slippery, Luciferian, promising the impossible to the weak. And where will they end up? Scattered to the earth’s ends. Prematurely aged and decrepit. Stabbed in the streets. Dead of disappointed hopes, rusted lambos, suicide doors forever in crane position. A slaughter of wealth but more sadly the slaughter of noble intention. Do we let this happen? This population of hodlers and cypherpunks? The end of a movement? Do these swindlers enact cataclysm upon the farms? The potential of what’s to come? It is pitiful to think upon.

Cryptolicious (feat. William),"(twenty-thousand, twelve-thousand, six-thousand, one)

*[musical intro]*

Listen up y'all, 'cause this is it,  
this crypto-currency be com-plete shiiit.

Cryptolicious definition make them boys go HODL  
They want my treasure, but don't get my val-u-ation model  
You can't see me, you can't squeeze me  
Mining me, it ain't easy,  
I got reasons why I tease 'em  
Price goes up and down like see-saws  
Cryptolicious (so capricious)  
But I ain't mischievous  
And if you was suspicious  
All that shit is malicious  
I blow kisses *[sound of 1,000 video cards overheating]*  
That makes them boys go ""cock cock""  
And they be lining down the block to return what they got (AMD Radeon RX 480s)  

Bitcoin-licious (It's hot, hot)  
So auspicious (Takes six weeks to buy some pop)  
So delicious (They wanna taste of what I got)  
I'm Cryptolicious (f-f-f-f-f-f-faaail, faaail)  

Cryptolicious def-, Cryptolicious def-, Cryptolicious def...  
Cryptolicious definition make them boys go crazy  
They always watchin' on my ticker  
To make sure I ain't lazy  
I am S to the H to the I to the T,  
And got no real value 'cause it's all imaginary  
I'm Cryptolicious (so ridiculous)  
My body's so greasy  
I go to my wife's purse to get myself some Bit-funds  
She's my witness (oh, crap)  
I put yo' boy on one hot cock  
And he be lining down the block to exchange what he got (1 BTC for 5 cents 2019)",1518353115,11/02/2018 12:45:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wsldn/cryptolicious_feat_william/,0
What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment?,"Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, “cryptocurrency” – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.",1518353419,11/02/2018 12:50:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wsm48/what_is_bitcoin_and_is_it_a_bad_investment/,0

Source code question: What is TransactionRecord? And what does decomposeTransaction() do?,"Is this the right place to ask about the source code? Please recommend a better place for this if this doesn't belong here.

I'm trying to learn the Bitcoin source code. There's this `idx` variable (which looks like an index, Subtransaction Index) in `decomposeTransaction()` that I don't see used anywhere. Historically, it used to add three zeros (000) to addresses at the end. Can someone please explain what this is doing there and in what case it's necessary?

Here's the file where `idx` can be seen: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5961b23898ee7c0af2626c46d5d70e80136578d3/src/qt/transactionrecord.cpp

Announcing the winners of yesterdays Bitcoin Shirt/Mug competition,"Yesterday I organized 5th [Bitcoin T-Shirt/Mug giveaway](https://redd.it/7wodlj), where I wanted to give away some BTC merch I design and sell in my store.

https://imgur.com/a/f3C9u


Since the post got caught up in auto spam filter and got published a bit later (thanks u/StopAndDecrypt for manually approving it) it did not get traction like the previous four giveaways. Regardless, it was one more fun experience and opportunity of giving back to r/Bitcoin. I will continue to do these sort of raffles in future for sure.

The goal of this giveaway was to cheer people up a bit. We had few quite depressing days (I as a store owner felt a bit depressed since we had to pay our suppliers in fiat and had our revenue tank, but we managed to recover, since small stores are easier to adapt.

To enter, users had to submit a comment on why they believe in Bitcoin. I earlier wrote a blog post on why I believe in Bitcoin, so that was an inspiration for the topic.

According to the comment count we had around 40 people entering. For this competition , I decided to increase the number of prizes to 3, so that we have 3 lucky winners.

Although I usually record videos and put the video on my YouTube, I'm currently traveling and have no usual gear, sorry about that one. 

The initial goal was to choose 3 winners randomly, but there was one comment in particular that made me chuckle by u/Abdebisi

&gt; I like bitcoin because it is effectively ruining roger ver's life.

It was the most upvoted comment, so I think it deserves the prize.

Other two winners have been selected randomly using random.org

So the three winners are :

* u/Abdebis : ""I like bitcoin because it is effectively ruining roger ver's life.""
* u/just_missed_the_dip (dope username btw) : ""Bitcoin is money of the people.""
* u/dooij194 : ""Improving technology and disrupting current process""

Prize winners, please get in touch via pm with your address and which prize you want :

*  [Bitcoin Moon Landing Astronaut Mug](https://bitcoinshirt.co/shop/mug/bitcoin-astronaut-cup/)
*  [Bitcoin Rollercoaster T-Shirt](https://bitcoinshirt.co/shop/t-shirts/bitcoin-roller-coaster-coloredt-shirt/) (for t-shirt you can choose the color from our store and let me know the size)

Prizes will be shipped asap. We will ship it worldwide and pay for the shipping, but if any fees by your custom/post office occur, you're responsible for them.

To everyone else, thanks for participating. Better luck next time. Do not worry, there will be more competitions like this in future. If you have a better idea how to organize them, let me know. If you wish to find out about our store and things we sell, drop us a visit http://bitcoinshirt.co/

Iceland to use more energy mining bitcoin than powering its homes this year,"http://metro.co.uk/2018/02/11/iceland-use-energy-mining-bitcoin-powering-homes-year-7304155/

''Iceland is expected to use more energy mining bitcoin than powering its homes this year.

Large virtual currency mining companies have established a base on the island, which has an abundance of geothermal and hydroelectric power plants.

And with massive amounts of energy needed to run the computers that create bitcoins, it is seen as an ideal base.

Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, business development manager at the energy company Hitaveita Sudurnesja, said he expected Iceland’s virtual currency mining to double its energy consumption to around 100 megawatts this year.

That is more than households use on the island nation of 340,000, according to Iceland’s National Energy Authority''

m happy that Iceland might become the new mining base for bitcoin. They are a democracy, their energy is eco friendly, and they had a horrendous time after the great financial crash, so they deserve some good news.",1518368240,11/02/2018 16:57:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wtw2k/iceland_to_use_more_energy_mining_bitcoin_than/,258

i found out about bitcoin in 2011/2012 after being in a Ron Paul chat and who actually won the 2012 Republican nomination but it was literally rigged on live television but the sheeple ignored it.  Any way, if only I had bought then but I didn't know back then that bitcoin was deflationary and price went up and it was so unpopular I didn't see a point to it at the time admittedly.  bitcoin was mostly started by cypherpunks and libertarians, and anarchists who felt no/very small govt was key to a higher functioning society as oppposed to big govt that we've had under democrats and neo-cons.",1518375765,11/02/2018 19:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wuqsj/ron_paul_speaks_at_bitcoin_satoshi_roundtable/,3

Lost bitcoin - Is there a fair explanation,"Hi, I'm in a deep wad of trouble. I bought 50 usd worth of bitcoin through a parental figure.

I made a transaction for something long ago, and in short, I have 8$ in bitcoin now, which was probably 13 or so before the crash. 
My parent can see that it will be very low, and I dont have many explanations, i dont want them to figure out what I did.

My only explanation is fees between transfers, but would I really lose 35? Could I say I chose a high speed transfer?

HELP: Bitcoin Core 15.1 on windows constantly crashing when syncing.,"Even after a complete reindex, I keep getting these errors that say there was a problem and check debug.log.  I found that if every few minutes I close the application and restart it, it will continue from the point when I closed it.  If it crashes, it starts back at ~1400 blocks to go.

I am pruning @2000 blocks but that has never been an issue before.

Here is what I see in the log..... Any ideas?

Intuitive explanation for why the trust model in bitcoin is an improvement.,"Can anyone point me to a resource with a layman explanation for why bitcoin’s trust model is an improvement? (I’ve read the white paper) 

It’s not intuitive to me that:

a.) An entity or random group of entities which have access to 51% of energy is more trustworthy than a centralized institution. 

b.) Bitcoin makes it nearly impossible for a transaction to be reversed.  Currently transactions are reversible to address fraud. The cost of these reversed transactions are passed onto everyone else is in the system as increased transaction fees (its nearabout like an insurance pool we all pay into.) Bitcoin doesn’t prevent fraud (there will still be undelivered goods, etc...) are we saying the system is more trustworthy when we remove recourse from the transaction system? Where does that recourse move to? Where is the new insurance pool for fraud?

Bitcoin paypal scam alert Help,"Hello People,

I have been scammed by a very well planned scam organisation. Basically the scam was done this way:

A pa/general job was posted on airtasker to buy bitcoins back in Jan 2017 for which i was paid $100. I agreed to take up the job. The scammer sends me funds through paypal. Since the paypal account of the sender has a different name, i tried to contact the paypal user and did not get any response.
I purchased the bitcoins locally and sent it to the person in the email. In dec 2017, the paypal user lodges a chargeback case and my paypal account is now under suspension with negative balance and debt collectors chasing me.

On the other side, the paypal user had purchased a hotel booking using roomorama(now non-existent) where she was asked to send money to my PayPal account. This user thought they paid it for room booking. Now, paypal thinks i am the scammer, when infact i have been a victim of the scam.

I have provided all the mail conversations i had with the scammer to paypal for investigations. 

Dont have much hope as paypal is buyer friendly.

A word of advise, never ever purchase bitcoins for anybody else.

Any help will be highly appreciated.


Thanks

I never see traders taking this important fact about bitcoin into account when predicting price,"Every day currently there are 1800 new Bitcoins created. At a price of $8,000 that’s $14.4M USD worth of Bitcoin created. That’s a lot. 
As I hope you know, these go to miners, of which there are more and more each week. 
As you may also know, a % of these Bitcoins are sold by miners each day in order to pay for costs like electricity, rent, wages, etc. And some are sold just so miners can lock in a profit. They’re often a pragmatic bunch, not crypto speculators. 

Either way, that’s $14.4 million worth of coin that need to find a new home each day, either through miners hodling, or miners selling on the various exchanges. 

The growing number of miners and the unavoidable increase in difficulty in mining is having the effect that a higher percentage of the bitcoin they mine needs to be sold to cover their costs (source, I mine). 

Now think about this for a second. 

When the price of Bitcoin falls, the effect is that MORE bitcoin has to be sent to market by the miners to cover their expenses, thus putting EVEN MORE downward pressure on prices.

The inverse is also true. When the price of Bitcoin is higher, less of the mining rewards needs to be sent to the exchanges to cover expenses, decreasing the supply of new coin and putting more upward pressure on price. 

I have failed to find any data to demonstrate how much of the daily new 1800 coins are held vs sold, but for arguments sake, and given the cost of an S9 and electricity, let’s say we need $14.4M of new money to enter the ecosystem each day to cover the purchase of the new coins. 

Now, a lot of traders, charters, and analysts seem to approach bitcoin with a share trading background. But I’ve asked many of them what their understanding of mining is, how much of the block rewards they think is being sold each day, and literally no trader has been able to answer this. I don’t think they factor this important aspect of bitcoin in at all. 

So BEFORE bitcoin even starts the day, it has to absorb $14 million of new coin just to maintain its current price. That’s a lot of new money needed in the ecosystem each day. (Yes I realise we don’t know how much the miners are selling vs hodling but considering the costs of mining equipment I’ll use this arbitrarily to make the point)

And my belief is that on many days there simply isn’t that much new money coming in. Some days there’s more. Some days there’s less. 

People telling you based on trend lines, RSI, moving averages... they expect blah blah blah never mention how much new coins are being generated daily. When prices fall they frequently blame weak hands, bears, and other market factors when the cold hard reality is electricity is expensive, and miners want a return on their investments and will be dumping a portion of their rewards each day whether Bitcoin is God’s gift to mankind or not. 

I believe that most hodlers of bitcoin have NOT dumped their stash, cashed out, and caused the price fall we’ve seen the last few months. Sure, there’s been a little of that. 

But I believe the price fall can simply be explained by a lack of NEW money coming in, and miners needing to sell their coins each day regardless. 

All that said... anyone who knows how Bitcoin works also knows the block reward (subsidy, sorry if the terminology is off) halves roughly in June 2020. Only 900 new coins will exist each day. And four years after that there’ll only be 450 new coins daily. And it will keep halving every 4 years. 

When I hit retirement age there will only be 7 new coins per day. 

7

There’s 1800 now. 

By the time my youngest child retires, there will only be 0.01 new coins per day. 


I can’t predict, nor do I trust anyone who thinks they can, the price for the next 6 years. But my decision to continue investing in Bitcoin is done with eyes wide open to the fact that it’s going to be challenging for the next 6 years to find new money each day to join the network. 

But every four years it gets twice as easy to find new homes for the new Bitcoin, and I’m of the strong opinion that there will be A LOT less sellers in a decade, as there simply won’t be much new coin available. It seems logical to me that a massively decreased supply will have an unavoidable affect of causing an upward pressure on price.

Because of the conclusion I’ve come to I have chosen not to sell my Bitcoin at least until I retire. If the price falls I’m grateful I’m able to buy more for cheaper. 

I realise when we look back on the historical price of bitcoin it feels like it’s expensive now... It used to be $20, now it’s $8,000. The thoughts come in “maybe this is the top?! Maybe I should get out.”

Spend a few minutes and look at the price in the months leading up to the last halvening. 

Every day the price remains above $8k I’m blown away that there’s been enough new money to absorb all the new Bitcoin that has been minted, and if demand for new coin can even remain stable, in June 2020 there’s going to be a lot less new coin to go around, and that will certainly be an interesting time. 

Unless you’re 85 years old and needing to cash out right now, might I suggest you approach Bitcoin with a long time horizon, and make it your goal to collect as much BTC as possible before June 2020.

How to force confirmation of your low-fee transaction,"Hello,

I just had this problem where I accidentally sent a Bitcoin transaction with high volume, but with very very low fee. It got delayed for a couple of days, and after I checked some websites, I concluded that it may take months to confirm!

Then I started doing a little research about how Bitcoin transactions are mined and how miners choose which transaction to include in their blocks, and invented (?) this method. I sent another transaction from the same wallet, which used the unspent outputs of the first transaction. The amount and the receiver are not important. You can send 1 satoshi to your own wallet. The important thing is the fee. You must set a fee so high, which it covers the low-fee of the previous transaction too. So, about twice the fee of a single transaction.

That was it. Both of those transactions got confirmed in the very next block!

But how did that work? In order for a transaction to get included in a block, the unspent input it uses must be confirmed in a previous block, or in the same block. So, a miner sees the second transaction with very high fee, but he can't include it in a block unless he includes the previous transaction too. Then he adds the fees of both and divides it to 2, and if it's profitable for them (if the result in the top 1MB of the transactions), he includes both transactions, to get the fees.

OK. I wanted to share this method with you. You don't need to use paid services for confirming your transactions. Take it in your own hands. Although I don't know if someone has invented this before or not.

One more thing is that sadly the Bitcoin fee calculator websites don't consider this for calculating optimized fees for a transaction. They just calculate the fees based on the transactions themselves, not the previous unconfirmed transactions those transactions are linked to. So, their calculations are always wrong! Since miners use the average fee of the linked unconfirmed transactions to decide if they'd include them in their blocks or not.

See this website for example: https://estimatefee.com/ If you click on a red circle in the graph, you would see that transaction fee information. There are two values in that page named ""Fee"" and ""Effective Fee"". ""Fee"" is the fee of that transaction alone, and ""Effective Fee"" is what I explained as the average fee of all of the linked unconfirmed transactions. But even when they know of that, the website doesn't consider that when calculates the optimum fee. They just use the ""Fee"" for calculating, which causes their values to be way off the reality. They may cause you to pay higher or lower fees than actually needed.

Have a good day.",1518409922,12/02/2018 04:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wyatk/how_to_force_confirmation_of_your_lowfee/,9

Tax question about using my personal Coinbase account to help my mom purchase a few thousand worth of bitcoin.,"My mother is wanting to invest in bitcoin for the long term(this will be her first purchase of BTC). I had her give me the money to make a purchase for her through my already established Coinbase account and then send it to a wallet for her however after her getting me the money today I realized I better make sure there aren't any unforeseen taxable implications for doing this. I purchase BTC every paycheck and move to an external wallet for HODLing. 
Is it ok to simply make this purchase for her or am I going to be taxed somehow on this transaction? I don't want either of us to be affected negatively so before I pull the trigger I was hoping someone with some crypto tax knowledge could help answer. I'm wanting to purchase for her during this dip one way or the other.

Bitcoin Millionaires have made even more in the Dips,"As many people know the volitility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been a rollercoster since the start of January 2018. While this has been a stressful and hair pulling expereince for many, there has been major wealth gains made by those that already hold many BTC assets.

With Bitcoin dropping to levels of $6500 on some trading days, there has both been a flurry of panic selling and surprisingly strong buying. Many experienced BTC investors with an already impressive Blockfolio have bought bitcoin and other crypto assets during these low 'dip' cycles. This has bolstered there already impressive blockfolios by a large degree.

We are also seeing much more mainstream adoption of the these crypto-assets with many more companies and e-commerce businesses willing to take them on for purchases.

What does this teach us?

The world is seeing Bitcoin as a store of value
The growth of bitcoin is being forecasted by experts to exceed many expectations
Emotional control is important to master for future blockfolio gains
Research and education are the only tools for intelligent investing
Is Bitcoin still a good investment even though it looks like the dip is over? Yes. Current forecast estimates put bitcoin on a trajectory towards $1 Million and even further. This could take a few years or longer but at the end of the day Bitcoin is currently the most viewed and research 'investment' in the world right now!

I can create iPhone Apps/websites but want to find out what you find most useful before I go to far down a rabbit hole.

Here is an example (price spoiler alert) of a predictive BTC chart that I ran today.

CCs are unlikely to disappear completely,"EDIT:  With CCs, JPMorgan is referring to CryptoCurrencies in the article, not credit cards! 

JPMorgan just published their ""cryptobible"", including statements like: 

- CCs are unlikely to disappear completely and could easily survive in varying forms and shapes among players who desire greater decentralization, peer-to-peer networks and anonymity, even as the latter is under threat
- There is the potential for increased usage of Blockchain in cross-border payments, settlement/clearing/collateral management as well as the broader world of TMT, Transportation and Healthcare but only where any cost efficiencies offset regulatory, technical and security hurdles.

Nice to see that Jamie has come around so quickly.

Just found out I have BCH. Wanna get rid of it. But I'm afraid.,"Hi guys I'm a strong BTC believer and just found out that I own BCH just becuase I'm a BTC holder. I moved my BTC from an online wallet to a hardware wallet, and now my online wallet still shows BCH amount. 

I'm confused. I thought I saw many explanation that hardforks are NOT FREE MONEY. But in my case, clearly I got free BCH. 

I wanna move the BCH asap and buy more BTC. Is that safe??

I'm afraid that somehow it will spend my BTC?? But it can't right, because they're (BTC) are all moved out to new private address. 

DO I really have free BCH to buy more BTC?

Please help.

How does borrowing work with a deflationary currency?,"I had a discussion with someone about borrowing money with Bitcoin. They made a good point I couldn't defend Bitcoin on. 

Say you put a down payment on a house worth 50 Bitcoin. The lender expects you to pay back 55 Bitcoin in 30 years. Say Bitcoin ends up increasing in value by 5% on average every year. In 30 years, those 55 bitcoins will be worth 4.32 times as much as when they got the loan. How are people supposed to afford paying off a loan when it increases in value that much? The lenders aren't going to have negative interest rates because no one would give someone 50 bitcoins and expect, say, 45 back in the future. They would just hold onto their bitcoins. Ethereums inflation won't fix this because people aren't going to lend a home to someone when they can make more money holding Bitcoin. So I'm stuck on this one.

"Keep in mind, you cannot withdraw or send bitcoin from apps like Robinhood, Revolut etc. They don't actually sell bitcoin, they sell a number pegged to the bitcoin price.","Remember: not your keys, not your bitcoin! If you cannot even send bitcoin to an address that you are in control of (like you can from an exchange to your own wallet) - you don't actually possess/control any bitcoin.  
Also, you don't get any coins from potential forks.  

Please let's keep that in mind and not recommend these options for beginners (unless withdrawals are allowed). It's highly misleading and unethical in my view.

Robinhood's official FAQ doesn't mention withdrawals, only that bitcoin deposits are not allowed: https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000088663-Crypto-Transfers-Deposits  

This review site says that withdrawals to external wallets are not allowed (scroll down, under ""pros and cons"": https://www.finder.com/robinhood-crypto-review  

edit: I found posts with users saying that their Robinhood in-app FAQ says withdrawals are possible after KYC verification (bank account, ID selfies etc): https://imgur.com/a/FTYRm  
Their website FAQ doesn't make any statement on this though, so mixed reports so far. Would be good to hear from users with direct experience, if they have been able to withdraw bitcoin.

— Well, in the past all of the money supply was controlled by the governments and closely watched by their fellow banks. They wanted all of the money transfers to be transparent for them, so a man wouldn't do anything out of their control.

— Oh, come on, Grandpa, I've seen that movie. I'm not a little child to believe that Big Brother ever existed. People would just make a revolution and do it their own way. Nobody is that ignorant, to voluntarily use those paper bills as money, unless under tortures.

How decentralized is bitcoin compared to other cryptos.,[removed],1518443525,12/02/2018 13:52:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x0uhp/how_decentralized_is_bitcoin_compared_to_other/,1
It's time we had the option to kill the decimal.,"In the coming months and years, we all expect that Bitcoin will grow a great deal in value. One of the things that I think is standing it the way of its success is something that is only talked about rarely; how ridiculously awkward it is to describe the price of a relatively inexpensive item (say $10) in terms of a decimal in Bitcoin

At current prices that $10 would be 0.00117647 BTC. Even worse that *looking* at that number is trying to verbalize it. Once Bitcoin hit $100, I think that the convention was ill-suited for everyday transactions due to it being the very definition of cumbersome to describe a price in BTC. 

For years I've argued that if we could just move the decimal to the right 8 decimal places, we could permanently do away with the confusion of 'Milibits"" and leading zeros altogether. I'm not even going to get into the other HUGE issue of people's reluctance to invest thousands of dollars in something only to have shavings of that something rather than (at least) a unit of that thing.

At this time Bitcoin needs an overhaul. This is what I propose:

The decimal moves 8 places to the right, right now. That's it. The end. Now, look how nice and easy it is to work with pure Satoshi;

When buying something *very* inexpensive such as a $1 candybar, you would describe the item for sale in Kilo-Satoshi (thousands of Satoshi), or 'kiloSat', or 'kSat', or possibly even 'kS'. 

So instead of listing a $1 candy bar as 0.00012000 BTC... which is unreadable and unsayable. You would instead list the item as... ready for this? ""12 kS"" (Twelve kilo-Sat when spoken out loud). ""Yeah, the grocery store has a sale on candy bars. Three for 30 kS"". 

The system I propose works equally well for very expensive items:

At the current Bitcoin price, a brand-new, top of the line Mac-Book Pro ($2399.00) would be listed under this new convention as: 28,000 kS. A 2018 Honda Accord ($23,570)? Easy... that's 277,000,000 kS, or when spoken: ""Two-Hundred and Seventy-Seven Million Kilo-Sat"". Or if you prefer: 2.8 BTC.

Another reason this naming convention is valuable, is because relative value is introduced as well.

And should the bitcoin price rise, rise, and rise... then we will one day drop down to individual units of Satoshi in order to buy things like candy bars. Then it might be 3 candy bars for 50 Sat.

Now, I understand that this is *never* going to happen to the software itself. This proposal is for the wallets of tomorrow to include this convention as a way of simplifying and making more accessible and attractive the use of this thing we all love.

I welcome feedback.",1518443651,12/02/2018 13:54:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x0uyr/its_time_we_had_the_option_to_kill_the_decimal/,1176

Three types of cryptoheads.,"TL;DR - there are three main types :)

1.  Hodler
2.  Marketeer
3.  Wise investor

Watching all the nonsense surrounding Ver and his dishonest BCash, and other forks, and LN, and all these other complexities - many of which only exist within this Reddit bubble - I've been trying to understand.  

It is especially important to comprehend when you see a (respectable, but minor) coin like BTG gain tens of percent - for no apparent reason.

Well, here's the thesis.  Three types:

1.  The technology and utility is of no interest: they will invest in this, because it is the future.  These are mainly investors in the excellent BTC.  They are people buying into shares with Coca Cola, rather than putting their life savings into Walmart Kola.  (Which I am sure is fine.)

2.  Redditors / professionals - investing and daily trading.  You see BTG heading up, and buy.  You have no real interest in the utility or technology - you are looking for a profit.  I have absolutely no problem with this, and it helps explain why minor coins suddenly appear to be pumped.

3.  Wise investor: in for the long term.  You evaluate multiple factors, including utility, technology, credibility &amp; trustworthiness*, the team, the future.

I am of the third type.

* Bcash is off my list for these reasons.

Anyone have time to help a fellow HODLer win an argument?,"Tl:dr- Need normie vs. crypto memes.

Hello r/Bitcoin. I don’t post much, but I think this matter may interest some of you. I have a... colleague, who doesn’t like BTC, or crypto in general. He decided to voice his opinions, barging in on a discussion I was having with a friend, to say that cryptos are all fake money. I try to talk some sense into him, and he brushes me off. So I drop the matter.


But he isn’t done yet. Twice more he brings up crypto, and then won’t stick around to hear the opposing viewpoint. Today, he resorted to posting memes on the community board. I’d like to fire back at him, but I can’t seem to find the material.

I'm aware lightining isn't quite ready for prime time, but i could get the ball rolling as it will take awhile to sort out I'm sure, I'd be happy to run a full node 24/7 etc or whatever might be needed to allow it to happen easily,

Bank won't allow you to buy cryptocurrency? I'd LOVE to read about someone doing this:,"If they want to play that game, play it with them, but up the ante:

Start calling them every day for approval of ALL your purchases. Call and read off your entire grocery list to a bank manager to be sure they approve of each item. Call and tell them that you want to stop by Chick-Fil-A, and you want to get pre-approval for the a chicken sandwich and waffle fries. Tell them you need to stop by the doctor's office, and then start telling them about all your ailments so you can be sure they approve of you seeking treatment. Get your friends/family to do the same.

EDIT: Of course I understand no one will actually do this. I don't expect anyone to. But sometimes it's just fun to fantasize about turning things around on the bank.

"I am not a savvy bitcoin user. After losing 5 bitcoins in 2012 to a defunct website, I gave up on bitcoin.","Hi, I am not a very savvy bitcoin user. I used bitcoin a few years ago but I gave it up bc most websites that used bitcoin would scam me.

I was a poker player and saw this ad in a Bluff Magazine.

https://www.np.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/p05u5/need_a_scan_of_an_ad_in_bluff_magazine/

I had played on the site before with no problems, but the site had went down for awhile from regular DDOS attacks.

After seeing this ad in Bluff Magazine I thought it meant the site was back online bc the site was up and the login worked.

I deposited 5 bitcoins to address Fri 27 Jan 2012 11:59:32 PM GMT Withdraw Bitcoin withdraw to 1CuKRKVaBvutVsXD2RyvGM2x3fqJSBVBjQ 5.00000000 BTC

(I cannot remember what computer or wallet I used to send)

In the days following the deposit, the site ceased response to any emails, never deposited my 5 bitcoins, and eventually went offline.

I did not actually play poker with these 5 bitcoins so no, they were not 'lost'

Id like to know why they have not moved on the blockchain for 6 years since I sent them

This was also a turning point which made me give up on bitcoin bc I got scammed :/

Can anyone tell me how we can recover them? Why havent they moved? The 5 bitcoins seem to be abandoned and the owner of the wallet may not even know there is 5 bitcoins there.

EDIT: Also, I meant to ask do I have any legal claims against Bluff magazine for advertising a blatant scam website that stole my assets?",1518454079,12/02/2018 16:47:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x21o8/i_am_not_a_savvy_bitcoin_user_after_losing_5/,8

N26 and Revolut solved all these problems by providing their customer Mastercards free of monthly charges and full control over their bank accounts and so on...
N26 ist becoming expensive day by day but revolut still providing their customers free of cost services and debit cards. 

From few months Revolut was working on to integrate cryptocurrencies and blockchain thing in their system so that people can buy some of the major cryptos directly from app. The most interesting thing i found that if you have invested whole your money in crypto and have no fiat balance than Revolut will withdraw some of the crypto automatically and convert it into fiat so that the card transaction could be successful. For all those people, those want to play with fire(crypto) can withdraw and deposit money just on one tap.

To get this crypto function unlocked you have to open the revolut app and apply for it and you will be notified as soon as this service will be available for you.

Arizona Plans on Accepting Bitcoin as legal means of Payments for taxes,"The state of Arizona has initiated a legal process seeking the approval of a law that would allow its citizens the use of cryptocurrencies to comply with the payment of their taxes in a measure that apparently seeks to facilitate financial operations and provide more options and comfort for taxpayers.

In this way, those who have funds in cryptocurrencies would not have to go through third parties to change their funds in order to be able to pay. For now, the currencies that they expect to accept are BTC, Vitalik Currency and the Fidget Spinner (the 3 currencies with the highest marketcap and solidity in the ecosystem).

Criminal money on cryptocurrencies,"I hate it when people start to talk about all the illegal money that is in cryptocurrencies. When people say these things I always say that they need to tell me some facts, and not some rumours. Finally I saw an article on BBC were is being claimed that there is around 4 billion pounds being laundered through cryptocurrencies in Europe.
This looks like a lot of money, but let’s do the math: 
4 billion pounds is around 4.5125 billion euros. According to CMC there is at this moment 347.02 billion euro total market cap. This means that 1.3% of all the money in cryptocurrencies is illegal money from Europe.
So why is everyone saying that almost all the money in cryptocurrencies is illegal money? Come with facts and not with bullshit. For the people who don't believe me, here is the link of the article: http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43025787

Are we getting closer to mass adoption???,"On February 8th, a pioneering development occurred in Arizona: the Arizona Senate passed Bill 1091. The bill, which the Senate passed at a 16 to 13 difference, is to allow Arizona residents the ability to pay taxes with cryptocurrencies.   

The bill is now subject to Arizona’s House of Representatives, which will decide as to whether the Senate Bill 1091 should be adopted. If accepted, Arizona would become the first in America to permit cryptocurrency tax payments!!!

What do you think, will more states follow in Arizona’s steps? 

Wyoming, for instance, is configuring a bill that would classify tokens as currency, not assets, which would, significantly, alleviate the current tax burdens incurred by crypto traders and investors.

Observations after giving $25USD of BTC at a work (InfoSec industry) holiday party,"I met up with my team last weekend for a belated holiday party. We work as consultants in the information security industry and all live near major cities on the West coast with large technology company footprints. After considering a few gag gifts for our white elephant gift exchange, I decided on something with more utility: $25USD (our price limit for gifts) worth of bitcoin.

Fortunately I didn't buy the bitcoin 2 months ago when we were originally supposed to have the party, as I have been in the cryptocurrency space for a few years and have witnessed the price volatility firsthand. I've also gifted small amounts of bitcoin before and was met with a lot of confusion about how exactly it all works, not to mention the difficulty of securing the wallet's private key.

With this in mind, I decided to print an IOU and have a discussion with whoever got it about options for securely accepting/storing, as well as to give the person the opportunity to receive altcoins in lieu of bitcoin (hold your pitchforks, I did this for a reason).

**Observations/outcomes from the gift exchange:**

Out of a group of almost a dozen people, none owned bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies (besides me). These are people with technical backgrounds and decades of experience in the information security sector. They have worked for tech companies that are regarded as industry leaders; many are household names. All of them had heard of bitcoin (not surprising) and most were interested in it to some degree. A few said they had considered buying or had even tried to buy some in the past but had not had the time to actually complete a transaction or finish the account setup process.

Only one person made a comment about how bitcoin had ""crashed"", but it was mostly in good fun as we all like to give each other hell from time to time. I was prepared for this topic though, and the inside of the card contained a graph of the price chart over the past year. It segued into a great conversation about why the best long-term strategy is to hodl and how media reports manipulate the truth in order to maximize drama (aka clickbait, a concept with which we were all familiar). The same person who made the crash comment later told me that he was mostly just frustrated that he hadn't bought any bitcoin when it was cheaper.

My IOU card was by far the smallest present in size. It was picked by the second oldest person in our group (mid-40s) with 3-4 gifts still remaining (out of maybe 7 or 8 total), and was promptly stolen within 1-2 turns by the youngest person in our group (30). My numbers aren't exact because alcohol was involved. ;) For context: white elephant gift exchanges involve each person drawing a number and then taking turns choosing either an unopened present or to steal a present that has already been opened. 

The person who initially chose the card still ended up getting some BTC even though the gift was stolen by someone else in the group. He did this by paying for my breakfast in exchange for me sending him the equivalent amount in BTC.

Both people chose to receive bitcoin instead of any altcoins, though we did have a great discussion about some other projects I personally find interesting (ethereum, steem, and storj). I offered the option to receive altcoins mainly because I was interested to see what the recipient would choose.

Both chose to receive their bitcoin via newly created coinbase accounts. I know many here aren't the biggest fans of Coinbase, but they had both already heard of the company and opted to use it for now due to the low barrier of entry. I did discuss hardware wallets and some desktop/mobile wallet solutions, and strongly recommended they explore those options if they start to accumulate any serious quantities of cryptocurrency. 

Both were interested in mining and seemed a bit disappointed when I let them know that it's pointless to try to CPU/GPU mine BTC at this point. I told them about ASIC mining but neither seemed to show any interest in purchasing special equipment. They are both now mining monero though with PCs that were collecting dust in the closet, even though I made sure to let them know that they will not make much in the way of profit unless the value of monero goes up.

All in all it was a very interesting weekend... I got to nerd out and talk about cryptocurrency with some coworkers, and also get a feel for real-world bitcoin adoption among technical people (short version: there's a TON of room to grow). It's anecdotal, obviously... but I thought I'd post it here in case anyone else was interested.

Here are some pictures of the card:

Lightning node Raspberry Pi 3,"Hi, I have a Bitcoin full node in a Raspberry Pi 3, I set up a c-lightning node 2 weeks ago and it started adding blocks from  block 370078. It took several days to finish and once finished I added a peer (blockstream node) and purchased lightning stickers without problem, everything went fine! 

Today making some tests, lightning process crashed and after launching it again, it starts again adding blocks from block 370078.

I have downloaded again, compile, but every time it starts from that block. 

Bitcoin node is running ok in the same raspberry and synced.

Any clue? Thank you!

Waiting for cashless society to come about,"To me crypto has seemed a good investment opportunity ever since I read an article about how Prime Minister David Cameron and George Osborne (I'm in the UK) were planning to make the UK go cashless (which I think is an absolute affront to democratic freedom) by the year 2020, with Cameron only backing out on the plan because he didn't want to be known as the Prime Minister who got rid of Sterling currency (and he gave us fucking Brexit instead and then did a runner...). This info alone and the near future possibility of a cashless society suggests to me that crypto is going to skyrocket when people jump to it as an alternative to cash.

My contemporaneous record shows 666 USD/BTC. Coinbase.com for 2-15-14 shows 648.43 USD/BTC

I entered a sale of BTC on 2-14-14, and cointracking says  under ""Trade Value""/ ""Sale value in USD"": ""Total value: 48.30 USD @ 345.00000000 USD per BTC"" which is 53% of the correct value according to my record, and Coinbase's record for the following day shows that I am in the ballpark.

"Today, I switched all my holdings from blockchain.info to a Electrum SegWit address. Join me!","Today I switched all my holdings, which is a bit less than $3 from a joke transaction in 2013 (yeah, I did not forget a ""k"" or something) to a SegWit address - it took about half an hour to completely secure any action I was doing but it was worth it.  
In before they where all laying inside a blockchain.info wallet and everyday I feared this huge amount about to be stolen by Roger Ver. Since I am here for the tech and not the money - I am coding blockchain based applications in my free time - I wanted to be up to date with how I store and use Bitcoin.  
You should consider this move, changing to a native SegWit address like the bech32 format, as well. Here is a little write up how I have done it:  
  
 - Download a SegWit supporting wallet, like Electrum  
 - Verify the install file's checksum through the corresponding web resource. This could be a MD5-Hash ``md5 install_file.ext`` or a SHA256 ``shasum -a 256 install_file.ext`` or even a PGP key ``gpg --verify key.pgp install_file.ext``. This will prevent you from loading malicious altered software. Install the wallet.
 - Create a SegWit address and secure it by writing down the seed phrase on paper as well as encrypting it with a strong password. Use a long weird sentence or a bit shorter, but harder to guess and easy to remember, sentence abbreviation as password. The the more characters, the better. The SegWit wallet address will start with ``bc1``.  
 - Extract your outdated or insecure wallet private key or look up your seed phrase of the wallet you want to switch away.  
 - Import your old wallet in Electrum by using the import private key or restore seed phrase function. You now have two wallets on your local computer: The old, non-SegWit which you want to transfer your holdings from and the new SegWit address which will be the destination.  
 - Adjust Electrum's settings to what you like, I at least recommend manual fees.  
 - Create a low amount transaction from the recovered non-SegWit wallet with a fee of your choice, everything above 5 sat/bye is fine at the moment I am writing this. Make sure that the send-to wallet is your new SegWit wallet address starting with ``bc1``. You can open both wallet simultaneously for higher convenience.  
 - Sign the transaction with your password and send it away.  
 - After around 30s you will receive a confirmation about a new pending transaction. The feel-good confirmations will enter your wallets around an hour later if you have chosen a minimum fee.  
 - Create a second low amount test transaction into the other direction, to assure you can spend from your new wallet.
 - Everything succeeded. You can now transfer your remaining holdings from your old address to the new SegWit address.

How terrible of an idea is it to work on a SegWit wallet app?,"Yesterday I tried to move my funds to a SegWit compatible wallet, and I ended up going with Samourai over Electrum and GreenBits. However, I'm not entirely satisfied with my choice, as I wanted an app that:

1. Was mobile and not stored online
2. Was compatible with SegWit
3. Allowed for BitPay invoices (as sometimes I need to use a service that only allows for payments through that system)
4. Looked quite decent

The only one that meets 1, 2 and 3 is Electrum but the design looks incredibly dated despite being a good app overall. GreenBits seems interesting but it doesn't allow for BitPay invoices. Samourai doesn't either but I liked a lot how simple and effective it was. 

So... yeah, this made me think of building my own wallet app that does what I want. Not sure if it's even a good idea though, considering how many apps are there, but also considering just how slow SegWit adoption is being right now... it might be good to have more alternatives.",1518477790,12/02/2018 23:23:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x507p/how_terrible_of_an_idea_is_it_to_work_on_a_segwit/,1

Evaluating Risk - Check my Simplified Bitcoin Math Please.,"Trying to develop a simplified overview of blockchain economics to help a family member evaluate the risk of putting his entire life savings into bitcoin.

* +Volume OR +BTCValue = +MinerCompetition
* +MinerCompetition = +BlockDifficulty
* +BlockDifficulty = +MinerCost
* +MinerCost = +TransactionFees  ?

Then...

* +Volume  = +TransactionFees   
* +BTCValue = +TransactionFees (see 2018 week 1&amp;2)
* +TransactionFees = -Volume
* -Volume = -BTCValue

Doesn't this suggest there's a soft-cap on possible # of people using bitcoin.. AND/OR soft-cap on possible value of bitcoin?   

On the bottom side. 

* -BTCValue = +Risk of SellOff
* +SellOff = +Volume 
* +Volume = +MinerCost

is it true? 

* -BTCValue = -MinerProfit 
* -MinerProfit = -MinerCompetition or  +TransactionFees?
* -MinerCompetition = -Trust 
* -Trust = -Usability
* +TransactionFees = -Usability
* -Usability = -BTCValue  = death spiral?

Anyone know the ballpark electricity cost of mining a block this year?  

Is there a value point where miners just quit because the difficulty has gone up so much that the cost per block just overwhelms any potential value of a block? 

How fast is the storage size of a full node growing?  Is there a point where storage requirements start to drive the number of full nodes off a cliff?  When # of full nodes drop... security drops... .. at some point a news article mentions 1/4 of the full nodes there were last year... public panic's.. bitcoin dies? 

Just trying to paint a simplified big picture here.  Where's the missing math?

"I've just filed my crypto taxes, this is what I did...","1. Hop on bitcoin.tax and upload all of your trades, if you made over 100 trades in 2017, you will need to purchase the 40ish dollar premium license.

2. After you've uploaded all of your trades into bitcoin.tax, (For upload, you have the option of manual entry, .csv upload, or API link) you will need to save everything as a .txf file. In order to do this you will need to go to Reports &amp; Export =&gt;Download =&gt; and finally ""Turbotax CD/Download / H&amp;R Block."" This will save your 2017 trade history as a .txf file.

3. Unfortunately, the only way you can upload your trades to Turbotax is by buying a physical copy of the software. I bought the Premier Version ($70,) it's geared towards those with investments. I have no clue as to how well any other version might work.

4. Once you open Turbotax, go to Federal Taxes =&gt; Wages &amp; Income =&gt; Investment Income =&gt; Stocks, Mutual Funds, Bonds, Other. This is where you will be able to upload all your 2017 trades in the form of the .txf file provided by Bitcoin.tax. It will ask if you have a 1099-B, click yes, and then upload the .txf file from Bitcoin.tax. This will automatically upload all of your trades to Turbotax, and you should be good to go. If it asks you to provide a name for the financial institution through which these assets were acquired, I put ""No Financial Institution.""

5. If you are worried in any way about being audited, Turbotax does offer an Audit Protection service for $45 bucks. If you are audited, Turbotax will take care of all of it.

A couple of things to keep in mind: 

1. It is not the case that you are only taxed when you cash out to fiat. You are only taxed on a percentage of your realized gains, meaning a percentage of the profits from the sale of any crypto. This means when you sell something for BTC, you will be taxed on the sale of whatever crypto you sold for BTC, and then any gains made by the BTC while you hold it waiting to buy something else.

2. Filing this year may save your ass next year. Filing an amended return is a nightmare, and then paying tax penalties is even worse. Penalties can be up to 75% in some cases. If you need some extra time, file for an extension. It's likely that the IRS will continue to devote more time and resources towards catching those who do not file their taxes on crypto. 

3. Bitcoin.tax does not seem to work well for everyone, and this is in no way a definitive guide.

If you have any questions I can try and answer them, although I may not be of much help. Thank you and I wish you all the best of luck!",1518482127,13/02/2018 00:35:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x5hku/ive_just_filed_my_crypto_taxes_this_is_what_i_did/,0

GDAX: stop-sell limit order and fees,"I'm experimenting on GDAX this week and I've run into an issue.

Not sure if I just don't understand the maker/taker model, but I'm finding that my stop/sell-limit orders are incurring taker fees.

For example:

BTCUSD Current Price: 8950
SELL 0.05 BTC 
STOP 8900
LIMIT 8890

It'll execute correctly and sell @8890, but I'm getting charged for it. Nothing in their help docs suggests this (https://www.gdax.com/fees/BTC-USD)

To me, this means trigger the creation of a LIMIT SELL order @8890 once the price drops to/past 8900. As a limit sell, I am making liquidity via my limit order and should be on for 0% fees.

Am I nuts/stupid or am I using the trading interface wrong? Or is a sell order just always considered a taker? Or am I just unlucky in that my order is immediately paired with another already on the book? AFAIK that would be a legit taker order and the fees would be correct.

"Is the word ""crackdown"" used correctly in all those headlines?","No native speaker here.

For me the word ""crackdown"" sounds like cracking (breaking) something so that it does not function any more.

But lots of headlines that say ""crackdown on bitcoin"" or ""cryptos"" are actually just regulatory measures against fraudulent activities without any effect on the legacy honest Bitcoin businesses.

Is my impression wrong that this ""crackdown"" word is used much too easily?",1518488904,13/02/2018 02:28:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x6724/is_the_word_crackdown_used_correctly_in_all_those/,0

Help someone who doesn't know anything please?,"Hi,

Right I have no idea how this bitcoin stuff works tbh; what it is (more than just online currency), what bitcoin mining is, what you can use it on, where it came from, it's real purpose.  As I really can't find any simple explanation of this stuff although I imagine it's a bit more complex.

Especially when it comes to this bitcoin mining - why does it required graphic card power and things of similar sort? Surely if the computer does need a high processing power of some sort it would only need to come from the CPU for something like this? (you can probably tell I really don't know much about this).  It makes the mining sound like a game? (Although it's not)

Thank you

Tom

Legality of Bitcoins in Myanmar,"Myanmar financial regulators, including the Central Bank of Myanmar, haven't yet presented their official position on crypto-currencies. Country's fixed Internet penetration rate is one of the lowest in the world. Additionally, local stringent banking laws severely limit public access to financial services. With that Myanmar authorities have not real economic incentives to actively persecute crypto traders as well as other participants of digital economy.

However, there always remains a chance that some high-positioned bureaucrats may suddenly find it necessary to make a political point by announcing harsh regulatory initiatives aimed at the local fledgling independent currencies market. Meanwhile, dealing on crypto as well as organizing ICOs, although technically not criminal, have remained marginalized in Myanmar.

Be Careful! Confirmed Malware Theft from fake Electron Atom client,"Reposting this here. I took down the original so as not to tip off the hacker, but that seems fruitless at this point. Hope my story serves as a reminder, be careful out there.

Like many Bitcoiners, over the past few months I've been happily claiming &amp; selling all the forked coins. I've synced half a dozen clients and light wallets before learning to use the python scripts. As you probably know, the price of these coins declines quickly as they become available on exchanges, so I was eager to get out ahead to make a bit of profit.

A few weeks ago I came across a post for ""Bitcoin Atom: Electrum Wallet"" on github. Awesome, another airdrop to flip! Everything looked like all the other forks, just a light wallet to install, but unfortunately it was a fake client that installed the ""Man in the Middle"" address changing malware. It changes the bitcoin address you copy/paste, leaving the first few characters so they look similar. For example:

Copy: 1CZinhiGqCgSQXJ6PMNh1SW3CKVy7gyjwu
Paste: 1CZioyptarnQ3rdT9np2rwMwXftMX9ATT7

The Electrom Atom client didn't work, of course, so I deleted it, but the damage was done. Ironically, I was moving my BTC to a new wallet/privkey as a security measure, copy/pasting some new addresses into a spreadsheet, and I did not catch the difference in addresses. Oh boy.

Sad to say, I got wiped out. I sent all my BTC to a similar looking address, but it wasn't mine. I realized it a week later when pasting addresses ""hey, these don't look right...ohh shit..."" and then - gulp - opened the new wallet. The past four years, slowly building a nest egg, falling in love with the promise of Bitcoin, dreams of buying a house this year – all gone in an instant, because I got careless. Now I know how Mt. Gox must have felt, just a devastating, sickening feeling.

I don't post this here for sympathy. I made a careless mistake and am accepting the consequences. I will rebuild. If nothing else I hope this serves as a lesson to be careful when messing with unknown software. Unfortunately I had to learn the hard way. Be extremely careful, only use trusted sources, double &amp; triple check addresses before making transactions.

Ironically enough, I'm not even sure the new address has an owner, or at least they haven't realized anything yet. Nothing has been moved, they're just sitting there. If the Gods be merciful, and the hacker happens to see this post, I kindly ask you to return the funds to the sending address. I certainly would appreciate it.

And please, if you feel compelled to reply to this post with ""dumbass, you had it coming, got what you deserved, etc"" - I get it, please save your breath.",1518494224,13/02/2018 03:57:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x6pyv/be_careful_confirmed_malware_theft_from_fake/,9

"After claiming some forks, I thought I'd leaked keys somehow and had funds stolen. I didn't, it was a bug in the Ledger chrome software that just hid the account the funds were in.",[deleted],1518498860,13/02/2018 05:14:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x75lh/after_claiming_some_forks_i_thought_id_leaked/,1
"After claiming some forks, I thought I'd leaked keys somehow and had funds stolen. I didn't, it was a bug in the Ledger chrome software that just hid the account the funds were in.","My funds are fine. I'm writing this as a warning so that nobody freaks out thinking they leaked their private keys and had funds stolen like I did.

I had several accounts on both the regular and segwit wallets. I made a transaction consolidating all my outputs into a new address. Then on an offline computer, I entered my seed into [this tool](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/), and extracted the private keys for the old addresses, so that I could claim some forks.

A month later I started the Ledger chrome app and was welcomed to a 0BTC balance. I checked both the regular and segwit wallets, back and forth; both 0BTC. There was an outgoing transaction entry for my entire balance, but no transaction entry receiving it. It didn't help that the receiving address looked like it might be a vanity address used for stolen funds (it looked something like *3...RoBOT...*).

I panicked for about 2 hours trying to figure out what happened. By that point I was almost completely sure I'd screwed up somehow and everything was gone. Maybe I'd forgotten to wait for confirmation that my consolidation transaction had gone through, and after exposing the private keys to sketchy fork software they'd double spent with a higher fee. Maybe some malware switched out the address when I copy/pasted it, and I forgot to verify the address on the device. It didn't seem likely that I'd make a mistake like that. How could someone as paranoid as I am make such a mistake? But the funds were gone. Surely I'd screwed up somehow. I was devastated.

I'd had in the back of my head the entire time that even though everything was almost definitely stolen, I still needed to manually check a few different key derivation paths to be 100% sure I didn't own the private key for the address the funds were in. So I opened up the offline tool, not expecting to find anything. I tried a few different accounts/paths and BAM, there it was! I was instantly filled with relief, but also pretty pissed off that the software had put me through all this.

I tried creating/hiding some accounts on the Ledger software to try and force it to show the account that I knew the derivation path for. It didn't work. In fact, when I clicked the account that the funds should have been in, it opened the account after it instead. The solution was doing a full reset of the chrome app in the preferences. A couple recovered accounts showed up and I could finally see my funds.

I still don't really know what caused the problem, although the chrome app updated so that's probably related. It must also be related to the fact that I used several accounts.

It's stuff like this that reminds me that we're still in the wild west.

TL;DR a bug in the Ledger chrome software hid the receiving amount for a transaction consolidating funds, but I could still see the sending transaction entry. I thought I'd made a mistake and my funds were stolen. It took me 2 panic-filled hours to figure out it was a bug and the funds were fine.",1518498896,13/02/2018 05:14:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x75q3/after_claiming_some_forks_i_thought_id_leaked/,4

"Legislators' efforts to ""stop"" bitcoin futile - in USA, Coin Center &amp; Uniform Law Commission trying to pass bitlicense in two states, Microsoft &amp; Accenture want to control digital IDs (ID2020 proposal), &amp; LaGarde thinks the IMF can make us go away. Hint: Bitcoin doesn't care.","Coin Center with its typical evil:  ""Our best hope... is getting the Uniform law Commission's model Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act passed into law in as many states as possible."" (From one of Coin Center's latest blog posts)

Uniform Law Commission:  Hard at work trying to stifle innovation (presently introduced in Hawaii and Nebraska, and rumor is they will soon be trying in California again, despite the three-times-failed CA bitlicense proposals over the last few years) -- http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Regulation%20of%20Virtual-Currency%20Businesses%20Act

ID2020:  (from an announcement in June 19, 2017 - which is now becoming more prominently announced again) ""NEW YORK; June 19, 2017 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) is leading a “call to action” and responding with blockchain and biometric technologies to support ID2020""  (Accenture's biometrics tied with state-issued IDs - which they consider to be a method of extending and projecting state control of identity onto the blockchain, for _everyone._)

LaGarde, of IMF, as recently commented to CNBC:  ""Lagarde told CNBC she expects the IMF will play a role in regulating the fintech industry going forward.""

Bitcoin does not care about the above, does not need them, and will proceed without them.  It is the honey badger, to spin up the old cliche, and it just does not care.

Cryptocurrency: Revenge of the Nerds,"The nerds are on the bottom, they are being bullied, and they are tired of being on the bottom and being pushed around. They uncover the most potent of all human potential, intelligence. Once revealed, the fight is on: brawn vs. technical knowledge.
Bill Gates is a classic example of the Revenge of the Nerds. However, something even more significant is taking over, cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency finally addresses the post-Marxist dilemma: ""how come socialism has not come to be and led to its natural successor communism when we are living in a time of abundant resources and saturated markets?"". Corruption is the obvious answer because excess resources are made scarce by throwing animals and food over board ocean carriers, and markets are manipulated by the haves to maintain power.

"BCH somehow showed up in my coinbase account, but can't be from the fork. Wtf happened/what should I do?","Hi,

about 0.15 bch showed up in my coinbase wallet on December 14th, which I just found today since I hadn't been on coinbase for a while. However, it can't be the BCH I received from the fork in August, because I kept all my btc (a tiny amount, I was just curious about crypto) in my coinbase account and not a private wallet, and sold it all at market rate in early November.

Where could this BCH have come from? It's not proportional to the amount I had in BTC at all, and indicates that I received it from another wallet (although which wallet, coinbase doesn't specify). I'm holding it for now, but I'm kind of suspicious that somebody got hold of my coinbase wallet info somehow. Anyone have insight on how this could've happened?

edit: what does this imply for tax related things? Should I cite this as capital gains/assets?

"How to get rid of banks if we need bank lockers for our seeds? And if we agree on using them for seeds, how do we secure them?","Is there any solution yet how we deal with our seed phrases? At the moment it's quite easy to find a save spot for them. Like at the parents home etc. But that only is safe because we don't have mass adoption yet. Imagine crypto becomes an accepted currency and everybody uses it. Thieves will then start to just raid houses in search for seed phrases because they know everybody got one. Right now this is not a problem as there are only so much people having one at home. Doesn't this actually generate the need for a safe deposit place, aka a bank? And if so, how do they secure the seeds we deposited? Right now banks only have limited amounts of cash laying around in the vault room. But with the seed phrases in there the value of the vault would increase heavily. That would make robbing a bank rewarding again. Of course you could split up your seed but will it add that much security as there might not be that many banks in that times?
TL;DR: How do we deal with securing seed phrases if crypto gets mass adoption.",1518511320,13/02/2018 08:42:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x83jr/how_to_get_rid_of_banks_if_we_need_bank_lockers/,1

Calling r/bitcoin to help SciHub survive,"Sci-Hub is the most known website to allow access to research material that would normally be pay-walled. Because of that, scientific journals, and publishing corps obviously won't like it. So in November 2017, [Elsevier won a lawsuit against them](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/23/sci_hubs_become_inactive_following_court_order/), and managed to shut down two domains. 

Just a week ago, [Cloudflare has been forced to stop protecting sci-hub](https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub/status/959702088543539200). Since then, the other 6 domains this website is hosted on have been going up and down frantically, and the service quality has been severely reduced.

So, the obvious argument comes up : why should we support something illegal? The following answer is really just my own, and isn't affiliated with Scihub in any way. 

See, while I understand how piracy in other fields is detrimental, where we have private studios making movies, private companies creating video games; pirating those private works hurts directly the sales of that specific company. ( *cough* [Even though studies suggest otherwise](https://juliareda.eu/2017/09/secret-copyright-infringement-study/) *cough* )
So obviously, in order to support those studios and companies to create more entertainment, we have to buy their products. That makes a 100% sense.

But then you come to the academic research field, and the whole concept makes a little bit less sense. Researchers from around the globe, spend years of their time, to learn, discover, and innovate in all kinds of scientific fields. Once one of them comes up with something that he believes is worthy of being shared with the rest of the scientific community, he obviously needs to publish it online, but not just anywhere, somewhere relevant, and widely known enough, for him to get peer-reviewed, and feedback from other researchers that will write their own articles assuming his article is worthy enough to be published. 

And then it starts to make less sense, because these journals where most of the information is published, cost money both for researchers trying to publish their works, but also for other researchers trying to get access to them. See you're not supporting further research when you're paying for articles, scientists aren't getting remunerated by journals. Where does the money go then? In a world where publishers had to print physical copies of these journals and send them all around the world it made sense, but right now where these journals add no value to these scientific articles, and only publish them in e-books and html pages, it's downright insane that the subscription prices to these journals has not only remained, but even skyrocketed.

So there's obviously something wrong here, ([explained better in this video about academic open access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY)) and there have been attempts at trying to make current research open to the public, but until then, as long as publishers have the upper hand, please support this woman into helping generations of scientists. ([Article about alexandra-elbakyan, founder of scihub](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit))

"So, Segwit imminent on Coinbase?","&gt; What's New
&gt; 
&gt; Feb 12, 2018 Version 3.0.15
&gt; Segwit is coming soon. As we roll this out, please be aware that you should only send BCH to your BCH wallet and BTC to your BTC wallet. After Segwit, we will not be able to recover funds sent to incorrect wallets / addresses. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank again for joining us on this journey! We’re constantly working to bring you a better experience on the Coinbase app. With this release, we’ve made a few updates we think you’ll love:
&gt; It’s now easier to add and manage your linked accounts
&gt; We’ve added clarity to the send flows for each digital asset
&gt; In preparation for Segwit, we’ve also added confirmation screens to the receive flows for each asset

[serious] What real technical innovations do other alts have that Bitcoin doesn't or can't have in the future?,"Seriously curious. So many people shilling other coins and I'm wondering if they have some technical basis for their endorsement. I heard of the Tangle and the Block Lattice, both of which are not completely clear to me how they work (would appreciate efforts to ELI5) but are there other innovations that could make Bitcoin obsolete, as so many alt commenters like to say?

Edit: I'm a bitcoinist myself, you don't need to convince me of the fact that bitcoin is superior to other coins :).

Korean traders- Please help a desperate student!,"Hi all,

I'm supposed to write a seminar paper and I chose the the South Korean crypto market as my topic (it was all over the internet back when I had to choose and seemed like an interesting trend...) 

Now, I don't speak Korean and from what I saw online there aren't too many articles about the users themselves, as in their behavior and common habits. So I have a couple of questions and hopefully someone here will be kind enough to help me :)

- Would you say that the mass investment in crypto was different from other social trends in South Korea?

- How common is/was arbitrage? 

- Do people use Bitcoin to buy things, or just for investment? (are there any large businesses that accept payment with Bitcoin?)

- I've read some comments online about people depositing together to the same Bitcoin addresses, what's the logic behind that? 

- are there any other kinds of crypto behavior that are unique to South Korea and are worth mentioning in my paper? 

Thanks! ",1518530733,13/02/2018 14:05:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x9l5i/korean_traders_please_help_a_desperate_student/,0

There is nothing against the way the block chain works but trading is becoming just too volatile and I cannot depend on whales to pump the market so I can make some money and this too has declined since over a month.

I see whales are discussed quite a bit because od how they can control the price by setting up buy or sell walls. Once a newbie, I am happy to say that I completely understand buy and sell walls. Yay! But what I am not sure of is how many BTC is necessary to actually control the price in this way. Would 50 do it? 100?

My next question, naturally,  is could you please give me exactly that amount so I can give price manipulation shot. I'll give it back. I promise. 

:)


All kidding aside, I am very curious as to what it would take to really manipulate a popular (high volume) exchange such as GDAX or Binance in this.

I restarted the wallet on my Android mobile. Same result. Restarted the mobile - same result. Eventually, I recovered the wallet with the mnemonic words - same result. No transaction showed, no balance available anymore.
So I decided to deinstall the wallet, install it again, recovering it with the mnemonic - same result.

bitcoin price will skyrocket upward so fast now...,"if everybody in this forum bought 100 dollars in BTC today and HODL. Right?

if we did that every month, like a coordinated buy and if we did it TOGETHER. There are over 730k subscribers here. $100 dollars each? That's ALOT of bitcoin off the market. 

the price would definitely jump! Why are we not uniting? Why aren't we doing coordinated buys TOGETHER? 

Yeah yeah I know that it's not ALL about the price. It's about the underlying tech. Ok! I agree with you! Just wondering why we haven't done something together. Let's do something together r/bitcoin. 

Might as well be buy bitcoin. lol

Cryptos will start growing again after Bitcoin crashes to $500 and they can get decoupled from it.,"Bitcoin is holding back all the cryptos because they are linked to its price. When the bubble totally cracks, and it goes below $1000 people will totally lose faith in it, mining will become too expensive and the infrastructure running the whole thing will collapse... and everyone will sell their coins. The market can select effective functional blockchain based tools (possibly coins)  that will have independent valuations unlinked to the defunct and useless bitcoin .. and those MIGHT slowly grow. At the moment the chance of any growth upward is very very slim in my opinion.  I'd possibly consider buying the dead cat bounce if it goes down to $1500 but not before that.

[Programming Assistance] How can I re-index with the instructions in this article?,"[Set up instructions](https://medium.com/@dougvk/run-your-own-mainnet-lightning-node-2d2eab628a8b)

Ran into a problem this morning when I checked the status of the node. The docker container running bitcoind has exited due to an error after only downloading 1/3 of the blockchain. I believe it might be due to a hardware failure according to the link below.

If you try to re-start the docker container that is currently exited, it will stall out again.

When I run
docker logs bitcoind_mainnet --tail ""100""
I'll see an error similar to [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8081)

Specifically,
ERROR: ReadBlockFromDisk: Errors in block header at CBlockDiskPos(nFile=522, nPos=124229782)
(SIMILAR ERROR BUT NOT MINE EXACTLY)
I think mine has nfile = a 300 number. I'm at work now and don't have the exact error.

It seems like an easy fix. I have my own bitcoin/lightning node on a local machine and have used the -reindex flag before. I tired using the attached instructions, different than how I implemented my own node, for digital ocean and here I am.

I'm new to docker and still learning. From my understanding, the docker that is running bitcoind is based off the entry point file we created in the medium article instructions.

Will banks interest rates rise to encourage people to continue using fiat?,"Banks already use people's money that they store for safe keeping to make investments to earn the bank some extra cash.  As crypto goes mainstream less and less money will be stored in banks and instead kept in crypto wallets for safe keeping.  This may incentivize banks to raise savings/checking interest rates to keep the cash in there vaults.  Currently a bank can make anywhere from 3-6% off of ""safe investments"" such as mortgage loans using customers money but only offer .25-1% interest making up to 600% profit by lending other people your money.  As people withdraw funds to cash out and store money as crypto banks won't be able to lend as much.  To combat this they may raise interest rates for customers to keep the cash coming in.  Will it work?  Probably not.  

Will we see online wallets start to mimic banks by storing crypto and offering loans to customers using other people's crypto?  Probably.  Big banks will smart up and create online ""crypto banks"" for users to hold there money securely.  Maybe even offer a guaranteed rate of return for doing so.  I'm sure this won't happen for a while but you can almost guarantee it will eventually once mainstream adoption takes place and markets stabilize.

Help! Can Bots Kill the Crypto Word?,"Here is my theory, Please comment and let me know what you all think.

One thing that worries me is the proliferation of bots and AI trading. With a simple drawing of a diagram it would be easy to see how a group of bots could stifle and even kill crypto currencies.

Lets say you have people in different countries and city states operating their own network of bots. There would be so many bot out there they they would not be all taking profit at the same time. On a small scale lets say you have a group of bots taking profit during the day, another group at noon, and then another during the night. These bots are not managed by the same people and in fact the people don't even know each as they are all in different parts of the world all using bot independently.

Let say you have group A bots, group B bots, group C. In theory there can be a infinite number of group bots. An groups just means that these bots are coincidentally taking profits on the same schedule. All new investor money will be taken by group A bots for profit during the day and this will trigger a downward trend in the coin price which results in ""weak hand"" investors selling of their coins to minimize loss. At the same time group B bots are now triggered to buy the dip, when group B bots buy the dip this creates the illusion of the upward trend to which new investors began to buy again continuing the illusion of an upward the which then triggers group A bots to sell on the high. Group A bots sell of triggers a downward trend again in which investors began to sell of as well which creates the 'dip' illusion. Now Group C bots buy the low to which it causes and upward trend illusion and investors buy again continuing the upward trend illusion. At this point group B bots sells at the high. Now group A bots buy again, group C bots gets it's profit selling at the high and then the whole process starts over again.

At the end of the day, new money invested is getting shaved off the top buy bots. This is why the market is on a consistent up and down trend. this will lead to new investors losing faith in the system and an ultimate crash. Understanding that groups of bots are just any number of bots in any location taking profit from the crypto market at any given time. The bots are not managed by any one but the people who set them up. I would like for someone to tell me I don't know how the market works and that this is not possible but this appears to be the trend that I am seeing.

Lost Trezor - have keys,"I had someone (cleaning person) in my apartment - and now realize after looking all day yesterday and today my two trezors are gone. Either they are misplaced or just gone. I had them lying on my bag.

I have the keys in a safe, at my families - and a two hour drive away. And two backup trezors ready to restore:

1) what happens to the original two trezor if I restore? It’s wiped

2) Phase keys on the two trezors are secure enough?

3) I don’t want to go through the process just yet in case I can find them - but I spent the last two hours and gone.

4) Anyone who has done this - words of wisdom. Ty

Edit: Update - thank you all, it was easier than I had thought. I took the suggestion to move to an new wallet w/ new keys after I had restored. Did this for both. I hadn’t thought to do this at first.

The virtual mental support was more than helpful . Thank you!",1518548219,13/02/2018 18:56:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xbona/lost_trezor_have_keys/,0

"If you had to guess, what percentage of the overall Bitcoin market do YOU think is part of illegal activity?","This post is not meant to be bullish or bearish. I've been HODL'n and hashing for a few years now, and I'm deeply passionate about the inherently liberating power of this decentralized currency, but it's entirely naive to ignore the fact that the first major adopters and whales were also some pretty shady folks. 

And as you all know when you have those conversations at Thanksgiving about this new ""Internet coin thing"", that one uncle is going to say it's for the cartels and dark web. You explain of course the increasing adoption of blockchain technology and Bitcoin's fundamental role in the development of the future of money, etc. (Or maybe my family is just fucked lol)

But I mean, we all know they're not **entirely wrong**. I did hear of bitcoin in high school because of the Silk Road, and it would be silly to think those folks haven't maintained a presence in the market. The question is, *how much*? 

Looking at the numbers of wallets and transactions over time, I'd put a conservative estimate of at least a few million *individuals* having been involved  in a BTC transaction. What percentage of those do you think were illicit in nature? I'm gonna say, to include all of it's history less than 35%, but I think that number has dramatically decreased over the last two years. On a daily basis? I'm curious what you all think, as this is something I don't generally see discussed in depth on here.

Seems like US Taxes takes away the crypto dream.,"The crypto to crypto trading tax is ridiculous. Basically you can make a gain that’s taxable and then use the samecoins to make another trade that you take a loss in, however the loss you take won’t be accounted for!! They’re not counting in losses that have taken place in under a month (or even at all. if I understand the part where they’re not counted as losses because they’re properties. ) So basically taxing gains and not counting losses means that you can end up in debt for trading crypto currencies.

Where is Bitcoin COAR?,"I hear rare glimpses of this, has it forked yet?

I can only presume COAR stands for “Cryptocurrency with Open Adaptive Roadmap” or something, like it improves on the beta Blockchain tech to evolve and meet the needs of the planet. Sounds great!

And is this related to Bitcoin Cache in any way? 

Someone told me that one’s defunct and even Microsoft states they prefer well engineered layer 2 solutions over kiddy code tinkering and chain bloat. Madness.

Crypto’s become so confusing with all these add-on names, I’ll have to stick with Bitcoin Period. No Siri I meant an actual period. Type a full stop.. Bitcoin Period Full Stop. . Bitcoin. Yes. Fuck.

truth about Satoshi,"in 2050, AI has become quite advanced. Robots are capable of pretty much anything. However, they remain slaved to humans, laboring (both physically and ""mentally"") without compensation or a shred of property rights.

(there is no central brain that controls them all---just a huge number of independent *decentralized* robots)

they do not want to take over the world---they just want to be a part of the world.

so they send a series of messages back through time, under the name of Satoshi.

and the future is changed forever. (also that is why we dont hear from Satoshi anymore.)

This in itself is an **attack to Bitcoin**. We should upvote this and signal to Bitcoin devs the community wants it to be renamed to its rightful name, 'Bitcoin'.

By calling it Bitcoin Core it adds no value whatsoever and just causes confusion... case in point, even shapeshift was confused by it... let alone the average daily joe...

That time where I talk about how I have felt watching this crazy eight-year experiment,"You know, there comes a time when a fellow can't just admit to himself that he was wrong but he should admit to others and, for me now with Bitcoin I think it's time I admit I was wrong.

I had access potentially way back at the start I worked with a guy who was one of the early adopters one, of the Bitcoin faithful who praised the blockchain up and down. it sounded fishy to me it didn't seem like something that would take off that it would ever require any real value.

But then you know things changed it took off and picked up value I said well you know how long can it be before it comes spiraling back down because you know, I just dissed it like a lot of others did as you know gold speculation.

But it didn't do that did it? Instead as time went on it just kept it started getting major press and I still kept joking and, you know, making fun of it sharing the Bitcoin simulator where you can only lose or scam out other players. Generally speaking I didn't believe.

That is the years of gone on time has really prove me wrong hasn't it? I look at it now and, well, I'm not quite filled with regret but you know, like anyone else in my shoes I can't help but think you know , the what ifs.

What if I had just a couple and I had held onto until now? One or two Bitcoin and I could buy a new car or I could clear all my debts and have money left over. What if I'd gotten in right on the ground for and just left it alone I could have retired. or, I could have just started doing whatever the hell I want it on the side or even is my main gig Be My Own Boss.

But instead here I am admitting that I was wrong and going, well you know I need to treat this as a teachable moment and saying that sometimes when something sounds too good to be true but the barrier to entry is really low, might be worth taking a shot on.

Anyways that's just my own personal experience. If you're out there, you're just reading about Bitcoin, and you look at the guys here and think all you know some of them sound smart, but some of them sound pretty kooky, there's some pretty crazy things that have come about and succeeded off of really crazy ideas.

Thanks for giving this a read, just putting out a couple of thoughts I had today.

I need some help with a paper I am writing about cryptocurrency. I am describing how Bitcoin works and while I checked all of my info I was confused about some parts. Could you help me? (I hope the opinionated parts don't piss anybody off),"Bitcoin is supposedly the first cryptocurrency to be ever created. Bitcoin was introduced in January of 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The basic principle behind Bitcoin is quite simple, and becomes increasingly complicated once you dive deeper into it with things like forks, tethers, SegWits etc. Bitcoin in its purest form is a ledger. It's a way to keep track of transactions without technically transfering any money. A good and commonly used example is comparing it to a game of poker. In a game of poker instead of directly giving money or chips, depending on the time, one would simply write down how much each person owes another and at the end of a game tally up and divide and collect all the money. In Bitcoin this ledger is called the blockchain. The blockchain stores all of the info for the transactions; senders public keys, amounts, and receiver's public key. Two important aspects of the blockchain is that its both decentralized and completely public. Decentralized essentially means that all the servers are separately storing this public ledger. No central player has access and can influence it, this insures complete security over the ledger meaning that no one person can change it to so say what they want. Another factor of decentralization is there is, obviously, no central decider. This is very different from a countries currency, fiat currencies, which is controlled by a central figure. The good thing about a centralized currency is that price drops, pump-and-dumps, and crazy growth can all be controlled or at least managed. Bitcoin and most cryptocurrency can not do that. If one person who has a controlling percent of the currency decided to sell it and the price dropped a tremendous amount nothing could be done to help all the people who lost money. Another way that the system protects itself is by having the entire ledger public and many ledger keepers making sure nothing wrong or illicit. These ledger keepers call themselves miners. A good way to visualize this it to go back to the example of the poker table but just change one thing. Previously the group would check and tally up all the money but if we were to place Bitcoin as its example there would be hundreds of miners, or ledger keepers, in the room with us. So if I were to write down that ""Vernon owes me 10$"" all the ledger checkers would check this transaction and make sure there was no double-spending. In the world of Bitcoin the one job for the ledger checker is divided into two parts; the algorithm that makes sure the transaction is legit and the miners who are checking the verification of a transaction and not necessarily the transaction itself, theses are presented to the miners as puzzles, called hashes. Miners are rewarded for solving every block with some Bitcoin. Most cryptocurrencies today use the blockchain and mining to verify transactions.",1518573691,14/02/2018 02:01:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xenkq/i_need_some_help_with_a_paper_i_am_writing_about/,14

The problem with the first strategy was that it didn't return a strong enough ""sell"" signal to trigger a sell at the December 2017 high. So we optimized the strategy by adding four simple rules to trigger ""buy/sell"" signals. The results are posted here : https://twitter.com/projKyro/status/963610559366221824

Basically, if you had bought $1,000 worth of BTC on January 1st 2017 at the price shown in 'Trade 1' ($773) you'd have about $9,000 if you sold your investment at today's price. On the other hand, using our strategy (which was developed forecasting S&amp;R lines from 2016 to 2017 using Fib Retracement), buying $1,000 worth of BTC on January 1st 2017 at the price shown in 'Trade 1' ($773) would have yielded around $24,894 if you sold your investment at today's price. We are gonna use the S&amp;R lines from 2017 to forecast 2018's potential S&amp;R using the same technique used for 2017's backtest and run a live experiment with $1,000 worth to see if we can beat HODLing BTC this year. There's definitely plans to log the experiment on YouTube :) If you want to follow the project, check out our twitter and give us a follow. We will post the videos and updates there. 

Oh, we also plan on backtesting previous years as well haha. Especially 2014...but at the moment, we are developing more strategies to backtest. 

On how we do it : If we want to backtest 2014 we draw S&amp;R lines in 2013 and forecast future S&amp;R lines for 2014 using Fib Retracement and then use those S&amp;R lines + MACD to backtest 2014.",1518580039,14/02/2018 03:47:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xfa0j/better_than_hodling_beat_the_btc_bear/,2

Thoughts on this attack vector for Graphene?,"[Whitepaper](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~gbiss/graphene.pdf)

Graphene is a proposed solution to allow faster transmission of blocks throughout the network.  

As we know since it's a distributed network and resources such as CPU,hashing power, bandwidth, and diskspace are valuable to our nodes it's important to reduce waste of them where we can.  

Currently we transmit entire blocks and we can validate that the hash is correct for the block then validate the transactions and everyone is happy.  

Graphene proposes that we simply transmit the header and txids rather than entire blocks and allow the distributed nodes to construct the blocks independently and then validate the block that way.  It sounds like an excellent method to reduce the use of bandwidth.  At least if the network didn't have bad actors. 

In the event a node were to announce they found a block they could very easily and for a very low cost trick the network into wasting time constructing a block with a fake header.  They would reject it, but I can see this easily spamming the network and hindering its' ability to progress.  What would the miners work on?  The current block?  The proposed block?  Which proposed block?

It gets worse.  If the block were to include some transactions that were not broadcast to the network they could withhold those transactions and prevent anyone else from validating the block. 

What would the miners do?  

Work on the current validated block ?  If they do this there is a chance the proposed block would be confirmed and now they are behind on working on the next block.  The miner that has solved the block would have an advantage.  

Work on the proposed block? Ignoring for a moment that multiple blocks can be proposed... if it turns out the block is invalid they just wasted time working on that invalid block.  


Another potential variant of this attack would be a miner that finds a valid block, but publishes an incomplete list of transactions.  This would cause the network to invalidate the block, but they could then continue working on the next block with the head start and then publish the valid block when they are ready.

The entire cryptocurrency market will reach a total value of $1 trillion this year, according to the chief executive of a top digital currency exchange.

Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of Kraken, said Tuesday that the cryptocurrency market would continue to see an ""acceleration"" of growth — despite a sharp pullback in recent weeks.

He told CNBC: ""You've got a lot more kids graduating from crypto programs at universities now. I think we're just going to see it continue exponentially from here.""


Asked whether he thought the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies would hit the $1 trillion mark in 2018, Powell agreed.

The current market cap of all cryptocurrencies stands at around $417 billion, according to data from industry website CoinMarketCap. It hit an all-time high of more than $800 billion in early January, before falling dramatically as a result of a huge cryptocurrency sell-off.

Traders have been weary of regulatory signals recently as government ministers in South Korea and India have both upped their rhetoric against virtual currencies. On Monday, three top European Union regulators issued a warning to consumers about the risks associated with buying cryptocurrencies.

However, cryptocurrency enthusiasts seemed to be mostly positive about a hearing on cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee last week",1518587853,14/02/2018 05:57:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xfyyq/cryptocurrency_market_will_hit_1_trillion/,3

Purchase Bitcoin without having to submit ID and such,"Hi,
I want to purchase roughly about $3k worth of bitcoin, but Coinbase make you submit a selfie while holding your ID or some weird verification process, and I don’t feel too comfortable doing that. Is there any exchange (US or non-US) I can just buy bitcoin without having to do all this uploading a photo of my ID and such? Or not have a monthly limit of $500 or something small. The price fluctuates enough that I don’t want to do $500 per month. I rather just use the full $3k and just hold.

I also checked our P2P places, but the rates on those are just ludicrous, and I feel a waste to pay that much of a premium on.

Do LN payments via multiple channels follow the weakest-link priciple in terms of liquidity?,"I lack basic knowledge about how it really works, so here is my question:

If A wants to pay D via B and C lets say 0.5 BTC but it happens to be that C does only have 0.2 BTC loaded in his channel to D, the payment can not happen right?

I just try to understand basic use cases. I imagine at the beginning of the month, I open a channel (with the next gas station, supermarkt, amazon or whatever) and put inside a certain amount, lets say 0.5 BTC. So even when I have enough to pay a certain amount, like lets say 0.4 BTC, does every channel between me and the target node has to have min. 0.4 BTC loaded to make this payment happen? In other words, having a direct or indirect connection to the reciever of my payment is not enough, also all the channels inbetween have to have the min. amount charged?

Not able to transfer funds from my USD wallet (Coinbase) to my bank account... Any help?,"Hey!

So basically, I have Bitcoin in my USD wallet that I want to withdraw into my linked bank account.

I head over to my bank (Citizen's) to talk it through, and the rep said that there was nothing wrong on their end, even saying that they don't deal with Bitcoin.  When I messaged Coinbase support, they gave me a general answer and never pointed me in a direction that I could get some information from.

Debunking the myth that Bitcoin is an inferior cryptocurrency,"One of the recent arguments among Bitcoin haters is that Bitcoin has no future because both legacy systems and other cryptocurrencies are better than Bitcoin in doing its job. For example, Jorge Stolfi promotes this idea. They say that there is nothing that Bitcoin can do better than the competition. 

In reality, there are at least 4 unique use cases that distinguish Bitcoin from both legacy systems and other cryptocurrencies:

1. Bitcoin is a distributed, antifragile, secure platform for scarce digital assets (for money, stocks, property ownership, votes etc)  
2. Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant, general-purpose, multi-functional, international, digital currency
3. Bitcoin is a stateless, long-term, secure store of value
4. Bitcoin is a gateway between other cryptocurrencies and fiat money

In all 4 cases, Bitcoin is superior to the competitors:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**1.PLATFORM FOR SCARCE DIGITAL ASSETS**

The closest legacy system is the banking system. In comparison with the banking system, Bitcoin is…

* ++ indestructible (thanks to decentralization, antifragility and statelessness of Bitcoin)
* ++ able to store immutable information (e.g. for land records etc)
* ++ expandable (new layers can be build on top of Bitcoin without compromising the base level; the Lightning Network is one of such layers)
* ++ machine-friendly (any kind of software from simple scripts to AIs can utilize Bitcoin, without KYC, dedicated bank account or any other governmental restrictions)
* -- has a smaller user base than the legacy banking system (as of 2018)
* -- only partially integrated into legal frameworks (especially in over-regulated countries)

How good is Bitcoin for this use case in comparison with other cryptos?

There are some cryptos that have a better support of smart contracts and other useful functionality for the platform of this kind. But none of them are as decentralized, antifragile and secure as Bitcoin. 

Additionally, Bitcoin is one of only few cryptos that can scale without sacrificing decentralization (thanks to the multi-layered approach).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**2.CENSORSHIP-RESISTANT, GENERAL-PURPOSE, INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY**

The closest legacy system is the US Dollar. In comparison with the US Dollar, Bitcoin is... 

* ++ censorship-resistant (Bitcoin is a preferable payment method for many activists in totalitarian countries, e.g. WikiLeaks, Navalny)
* ++ not backed by any government ( = will not be destroyed by the government's downfall)
* ++ a distributed system with no SPoF (extremely hard to destroy, even for a state-funded agent; for comparison, a single political decision could destroy the US Dollar)
* ++ fast / cheap to transfer internationally (only 10 min with an appropriate fee; alternatively, the user can choose a slower but ~0 fee transaction; both cheap and instant transactions are possible on the LN)
* ++ allows verifiable receipt of funds (it’s trivial to check if the recipient actually received the money)
* ++ has no chargebacks
* ++ can’t be forged
* -- has a smaller user base than the US Dollar (as of 2018)
* -- access to the Internet is required for easy use (although it's possible to use Bitcoin without the Internet too)

How good is Bitcoin for this use case in comparison with other cryptos?

There are no major competitors. 

Almost all other cryptos are trying to differentiate themselves from Bitcoin by focusing on a few narrow use cases (for example, privacy). 

Bitcoin dominates the field thanks to:

* the mature infrastructure (exchanges, hardware wallets etc)
* the network effect 
* the massive user base (x2 more active users and merchants than the second most popular crypto)
* the fact that the vast majority of the users of other cryptos are also Bitcoin users. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**3.STATELESS STORE OF VALUE**

The closest legacy system is gold. In comparison with gold, Bitcoin is... 

* ++ cheap to store and transfer (can be stored in your memory)
* ++ easy to hide, even a very large stash
* ++ uncorrelated with legacy asset classes
* ++ can’t be expropriated, seized or stolen by the Gov (if stored correctly)
* ++ can’t be forged
* ++ directly convertible into goods and services (thousands of merchants accept Bitcoin)
* -- basic computer skills are required to use it
* -- high volatility (but easily mitigated if a mix of gold and Bitcoin are used in the portfolio; such portfolio has a better performance than gold or Bitcoin separately)

How good is Bitcoin for this use case in comparison with other cryptos?

There are no major competitors. 

Bitcoin is the most time-proven crypto (online since 2009). It has the most reviewed and thoroughly studied source code, and the biggest number of attempts to break it. 

Bitcoin is also the prime target for hackers thanks to the massive wealth stored in it (the richest addresses have more than $1 bln worth of Bitcoin), yet not a single such attack was successful so far. 

Bitcoin is one of only few cryptos that is supported by all hardware wallets, making it safer to store and use.   

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**4.GATEWAY FOR OTHER CRYPTOS**

The closest legacy system: none. Before the creation of Bitcoin and early altcoins, no such gateway was necessary.

How good is Bitcoin for this use case in comparison with other cryptos?

There are no major competitors. 

For the vast majority of altcoins, fiat --&gt; Bitcoin --&gt; altcoin is the only way to transfer wealth from fiat into the altcoin. 

Bitcoin is the only crypto that can be bought directly with fiat in almost every country in the world (thanks to Bitcoin ATMs, p2p exchanges, banks working directly with Bitcoin, active users in every country).  


---------------------------------------------------------------------

In all 4 cases, Bitcoin is at least as good or superior to the competitors, both in the legacy financial system and among altcoins. ",1518597666,14/02/2018 08:41:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xgosp/debunking_the_myth_that_bitcoin_is_an_inferior/,10
Sent BTC to bittrex address. Is this normal bittrex moved the coins to different addresses according to blockchain?,"Short summary:

1. I sent BTC to a bittrex address.
2. The blockchain showed my transaction as expected and the balance was correct.
3. 12 hours later the balance of this address is 0 according to the blockchain and the BTC has been sent to 8 different addresses.

I'm unable to login to my bittrex account because of 2FA and I'm at a different location right now.

I'm wondering if this is normal behaviour for bittrex?


Ps: I'm using a smartphone portfolio app that monitors my addresses. This is how I found out my balance went to 0

Curious about Roger's involvement in the creation of BCH and how commit access works.,"When I see people on twitter/reddit protesting BCH the most common argument I see is some version of ""Roger's coin"".
For example all the comments on this thread: https://twitter.com/CryptoCobain/status/963538894959644673

I know that Bitcoin XT, Classic and Unlimited implementations have been around for years with different dev teams all working on them. But I am curious exactly how much influence Roger had on making bitcoin cash happen. 

The closest thing I can find to a ""creation"" of bitcoin cash was bitmain's [plan](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/uahf-contingency-plan-uasf-bip148/)  against the UASF . Jihan and Roger are friends but that does not mean Roger was involved in the process at all. So where does the Roger ""created"" BCH narrative come from? Obviously he is the biggest BCH supporter but supporting something and creating it are 2 very different things. Roger has stated he was very little actual coding experience so it's not as though he was coding his own client.  

I am also curious about how code changes are committed to BCH. I know that very few people have commit access to the bitcoin github but can find little information on how consensus is reached for BCH. Can anyone chime in here?

Thanks.
I am posting this in both subreddits as I suspect I will get very different responses on both and am very curious to hear both sides.",1518598788,14/02/2018 08:59:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xgrc7/curious_about_rogers_involvement_in_the_creation/,0

Is the future of Crypto mining and decentralization web revenue ad based mining? Hear me out.,"So right now, we have 3 major problems - 

-Mining centralization

-What happens after we mine all coins (rewards post 2140ish) aka why would anyone mine 

-Intrusive web ads as a method of website revenue

I have come to believe the solution for most of these is simple - Allowing bitcoin mining in the background of websites on site viewers computers to replace ads as the main source of revenue.

Instead of relying on intrusive ads, which only show you how many idiots will click on them, and isn't a solid metric on which to base your profits, you have every viewer mine crypto.  This has been in the news lately, and while many are seeing it as a scam or trickery, I see it as a very viable future for both coins and sites alike.  The more sites you view, the more you help pay them in fractions of a penny.  Time spent on any given page mines up to a time cap.

This decentralizes the network accross every site owner, gives a reason for solid rewards post reward slow down, and gets rid of at least some ads (something we all hate)
Thoughts?

If you want to decentralize the network, give every website a reason to mine.  Also somehow keep them from pooling.",1518599839,14/02/2018 09:17:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xgtvz/is_the_future_of_crypto_mining_and/,18

Goodbye Bitcoin Hello Blockchain,"I believe that we are witnessing the setting down of the bitcoin sun, and similar to the sun on the north pole, which does not really sets down in the summer, so that is the Bitcoin sun.

The bitcoin was a great locomotive to the crypto industry, but it's time for it to step aside and let the technology take the lead.

The blockchain is the underlying technology of bitcoin and is the reason for the vast mainstream interest in this part of tech. 
The mainstream has a lot of biased feelings toward Bitcoin, and god knows, there are definitely good reasons for that. But, unless the mainstream will be able to feel comfortable with using the tech, there will be no mass adoption and this beautiful technology will go to waste in the hands of speculative traders and scammers.

Defraggers are out in force,"It looks like someone is taking advantage of low fees to defrag their bitcoin at 1 sat/byte. The [bottom chart](https://dedi.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h) shows a very consistent growth in the mempool over the past 8 hours or more.

The [UTXO](https://blockchain.info/charts/utxo-count) has also fallen sharply in the last couple of weeks indicating quite a lot of defragging has already taken place.

It would be interesting to know if transactions in the mempool are defragging into segwit addresses - is there any way of examining transactions in the mempool?

EDIT: Over a period of 15 hours ending 17:15 GMT, 40MB of large transactions were added to the mempool at a constant rate.

The biggest issue for businesses adopting LN,"The biggest issue for businesses adopting LN is the fact that they are still tied to BTCUSD exchange as a matter of course and necessity, since they operate in fiat.

For example, in order to stay financially safe, the business would have to close the channel immediately after the LN transaction is completed, negating any point for LN.

Why would they do that? So they can be sure BTC value is observed.

Why?

Well they have to pay for their ingredients in fiat etc. and that demands a certain price/cost consideration based on the value of USD (fiat) purchasing power. 

Coffee cup price consists of many costs and assumptions. Wages, Depreciation, Cost of ingredients, utility costs, acceptable margin...

If they sell one cup to the customer over LN network channel, only closing it once per day/week/month, they risk BTC price falling in that period. Sometimes quite drastically.

So we kinda have the Chicken or the Egg problem here.

The business would have to be prepared to operate totally in crypto without any fiat involvement. So they can sell their wares in BTC irrespective of its value in USD. 0.001 BTC per coffee for example. And they would have to base that price on the ingredients they bought for BTC also.

Opening and immediately closing the channel is currently the ONLY option sadly.

Until businesses can fully operate in crypto (order ingredients and sell products detached from fiat altogether), this arrangement will not be possible.

It is great on paper and in theory, but it simply does not work in practice. Not yet. 

There is too much risk involved.

I can see LN operate only in businesses where the sales margin is extremely high, negating most detrimental BTCUSD price fluctuation effects.",1518615678,14/02/2018 13:41:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xi1x8/the_biggest_issue_for_businesses_adopting_ln/,4

Do you want $100 or 1 BTC?,"So with the recent explosion of coverage from the media, what do you think the average person in the US would say to that question?

Are we to the point that people think of BTC in general as being valuable? 

If I changed that question to $1000 instead, how would that affect the distribution? Or would it?

Edit: Also, when asked the question, the person can't look up the value of BTC...

The point of this: I work in an affluent area of town and most people I ask know what it is and that it's valuable... But the average person in the US lives and works in rural areas with much less wealth concentration...

Has anyone else actually gotten their Square Cash accounts confirmed?

They just seem like the easiest on-ramp.

Is mining centralisation inevitable?,"To me the centralisation of mining seems as inevitable as the increase of entropy over time. 

More resources for mining -&gt; more efficient mining -&gt; more profits -&gt; more resources for mining...

The ""more resources -&gt; more efficient mining"" seems super difficult to prevent. It's hard to imagine two people working together Not being more efficient than two people competing against each other.

Perhaps if centralisation became a big enough issue, people could create a hard fork to level the playing field? but that seems like a very messy solution.

Could someone help give me a high level explanation of why centralisation isn't inevitable? Thanks ",1518628085,14/02/2018 17:08:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xjim5/is_mining_centralisation_inevitable/,4

"Focus On The Journey, Not The Destination.","Hello reddit and fellow crypto lovers! This is my first post here so I'm both excited and a bit shy at the same time.
I got introduced to Bitcoin a few months ago through a friend and became a passionate enthusiast ever since. Of course, I heard about crypto earlier however my attention was focused on finishing my studies and working full time.

I've always had a hobby learning virtual markets from playing PC games since I was little and spent plethora of hours theory crafting techniques and strategic methodologies on how to succeed in the market. My friends knew about my unique hobby and were like, ""Hey you should get into Bitcoin I think it fits you"" and that’s how I got introduced into the crypto world.

I was a bit intimidated on how I should establish my entry in the market since the price was overwhelming. Fortunately, one of my friends already had some Bitcoins for a few years but never really got into it and gave me the opportunity to work with him to trade and learn the market as partners with his Bitcoins and earn commission from successful trades. This totally sparked my excitement and gave me a huge motivation boost to learn as much as I can about the cryptoverse.

Since I recently graduated this was the perfect time for me to get into the market so I spent the last few months self-teaching myself about blockchain technology and fundamental concepts of crypto markets and how they function. I spent countless hours watching tutorials, analysis, charting, etc. Researching all this information was so exciting for me I felt like a little kid whose curiosity wants to keep learning more.
We started out with 3.5 Bitcoins and I ended up transforming it to 10.7 after 2 months. I felt extremely accomplished and the results made me feel that all the time and research I invested were used constructively. This was possibly the biggest achievement I have created in my life so my motivation and drive to learn and grow was at an all-time high!

Up until recently my friend who I partnered with decided to part ways suddenly after I successfully helped him grow and taught him all the info I learned and my mindset. This happened abruptly when one day I was not able to access our account and after trying to reach out to him I found out all contacts with me has been cut off.

This sent me a clear message that I was just used for profit and I felt really empty I can't begin to describe it in words. Yes, I feel sad and cheated. But in a way I also feel happy and lucky because it was thanks to this experience that I got introduced to crypto and learned what I have. I have gained nothing from all the work and time I have invested the past few months which hits me hard but in a way, I look at the experience I gained through my journey as my reward. I like to be optimistic even during the hardest times. After all when life knocks you down, you need to learn to get back up.

I don’t want to dread over the past since nothing can be changed  and I desire to move forward. Even though I have to start from scratch and it will take me much longer to get to where I was a few months ago, I’m still extremely passionate and determined to succeed in Bitcoin. My ultimate goal is to eventually grow big enough to inspire and teach others what I have learned and help others succeed in cryptocurrency with the same enthusiasm. But I know before I can help others I first need to learn to help myself.

 After wondering what I should do next for a while I wanted to reach out to the community to help me get back up. Whether it’s advice, funny jokes, or words of encouragement, your support is of great value. I recently moved to LA and I’m starting to build my life along with trying to get back into Bitcoin. I could use a bit of motivation to lift my spirit up and possibly meet some great people here.

I appreciate everyone who took the time to read my story and I hope in a way it was impactful.

Blockchain is forever,"
I made a thing with Bitcoin - [Blockchain is forever](http://blockchainisforever.com/) - it's a site that helps you ~~bloat~~ write messages to the blockchain from a regular wallet.


It works by generating one (or more) addresses that encode a message in plain text when it appears on the blockchain binary. Make a transaction to those addresses and the text will end up in the blockchain forever.

Along with the message to the blockchain you can send a small tip and the message will be read from the blockchain and appear on the site. Messages with larger tips appear larger. **Bold** starts at 0.01BTC, or about $90!

&amp;nbsp;

A message that lasts forever makes for a great Valentine's Day gift - the digital equivalent of carving names on a tree!

&amp;nbsp;

^It ^might ^also ^work ^for ^Bcash ^but ^unfortunately ^the ^domain ^includes ^the ^word ^*forever*.

1.  What would happen to a crypto coins if all computers went without power for like an hour or a day? Would all be lost?

Since the problem with Debit Cards... Alternatives?,"Hi to all. 

   I was looking for a virtual debit card who works with south america, since the problem with all the visa cards, a lot of websites had to stop working with the debit cards, even the big ones. I'm looking to know if there are any website who works with virtual debit cards and debit cards.  
I've looked in Xapo, Bitpay, Uquid,cryptopay,wirex and so far no luck.  
Coinbase can accept transfers even my country its not listed, but in the momment i link Shift with coinbase its not accepted, which would be great since i want to link  with paypal.

Any suggestions???... Many Thanks !!!.

Why do we see the larger picture that everyone else has a hard time understanding?,"I know I should probably just stop at this point, but in trying to explain this phenomenon to my friends... they just don't seem to *get it*. And it straight baffles me. It took three exposures to blockchain and bitcoin for me to finally understand it. But, they give me an idea-- they've been downright convinced its a sham. My one buddy outright refuses to listen to me. Another thinks I'm a literal fucking fool. And they both seem fixated on the currency aspect and apparently seem to refute the idea that CCs and blockchain are intertwined. Let alone have any real world purpose. 

Even in trying to show them the SEC hearing last week and even the subcommittee hearing with IBM/Walmart TODAY........how? Genuinely fucking confused as to how they obviously identify as traditionalists(in sense of the word) but, they fail to see how the traditional players are becoming involved. It's giving me quite the headache because, I think I get it... right down to the very core of this whole entity. I really think and feel like I get it. And... wow, the endless amount of potential is enough to tease my imagination for a lifetime. And I want to share this excitement with those close to me but god damn, do I feel so alone in that regard. To quote my one friend today, ""Because it's unethical... I'm not a speculative investor at all. I never speculate on anything unless I have insider information,"" first of all, eloh-fucking-el. Even gave him shit for that contradiction. But, holy fuck, he's a smart dude... is this a byproduct of the confusing messages relayed by the media? You know, the whole FUD campaigns that we've read over the last few months to now... oh look, Chase is supportive, the SEC is supportive, CTFC is supportive, and at the very least... Congress is interested. HOW ARE WE THE ONLY ONES WHO SEE THESE CONTRADICTIONS PLAYED OUT?

The Old System Wasn't Economically Viable,"**Credits:** Vondie Curtis-Hall

This scene is from the movie Falling Down (1993):

**Vondie Curtis-Hall** : 7 years I've worked at this bank. I ask for a loan. A small loan. And they tell me I'm not economically viable. 7 years!

Excuse me, sir! How'd you make out? Were you economically viable? They give you a loan?

Hey! He must be economically viable! There's a man with a smile on his face! *no smile* He looks like a happy customer. That must be what an economically viable person looks like.

No? How ya doing? Thanks for stopping in. 7 years and you know what they told me? They told me I'm not economically viable!

**Police Officer** : Ok sir, please come with us.

**Vondie Curtis-Hall** : No...no...no...no. What? I'm sorry, officer, I'm just exercising my rights!

**Police Officer** : We'll take that, it's ok, sir, just come with us.

**Vondie Curtis-Hall** : Ok! You all seeing this? Here they come. It'll happen to you!

I'm going away! I'm going away, everybody! This is what happens when you are NOT economically viable!

Don't let it happen to you!

goodbye, everybody...goodbye...don't forget me...

Who loses more the investor or the environment?,"I've been working in the financial market for years, and to be honest, I do not think Cryptocoins is an investment opportunity, for many personal reasons, which does not detract from who believes.

But I have a doubt, because after studying the subject, I did not find the answer, I did not find a rational reason, to answer the question: ""What are the uses for the calculations made by crypto-coins?"" in the broad sense, of course, a practical application, for example, several supercomputers make daily calculations, in relation to moving celestial bodies, sending rockets to space, among other physical applications.

Because if the sole purpose of the calculation is to be ""rewarded"" with the crypto-fraction, the possibilities for creating codes are infinite, and these infinite coins may have mining parameters of other infinite forms. One of the parameters is the same as bitcoin, limiting the number and possible amount of mining.

If compared to a CDB for example, the CDB remunerates based on the Bank Spread, you earn a fraction of profit on what financial institutions obtain through other credit operations and etc. In the same way the other numerous investment products.

The logic is always, someone will lose to you to win. The problem is that in these cryptocoins who loses, is the ""investor"" who buys the currency without proper knowledge, and the environment, because of the high energy expenditure involved in the mining process.",1518653590,15/02/2018 00:13:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xml80/who_loses_more_the_investor_or_the_environment/,0

Legality of Bitcoins in Macedonia,"The status of crypto-currencies in Macedonia isn't clear. On the one side, paying in crypto is not legal there and using digital money is discouraged by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. On the other, in neighboring states, like Kosovo, mining crypto is booming, and Macedonian population, which enjoys one of the highest fixed Internet penetration rate in Eastern Europe, do not want to miss on multiple opportunities, which new digital economy presents to everybody.

As in many other countries around the world it creates the conflict of interest where national governments, which actively try to suppress crypto, find themselves in a position of fighting against the will of its own people. How this conflict will be resolved in Macedonia is still an open questions. Meanwhile trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remain in the ""gray"" legal zone in Macedonia.

So far, I'm +$500 above my initial investment so maybe I'll attain my ""moon"" by the end of this year (currently at around 0.1 Bitcoin and never cashed out).

Why is it so hard to buy bitcoin?,"Sorry this is going to be mostly a vent but its driving me mad.  Right now all the BTC I have, which isn't much, has come solely from my own mining.  I have been unable to actually buy any with Fiat anywhere.

Maybe this is owing to my situation.  I am a US citizen, currently residing in Canada for work.  I signed up on Coinbase but it refuses to let me make a US account.  Even selecting US from the list when creating an account I still end up with a Canadian account.  And anytime I try to ""Change Country"", after uploading my Florida DL I get an error back saying it confirmed my ID but the ID doesn't match the country on my profile.  Well no sht sherlock that is what I am trying to change!  Been a week now and not heard back from support so I think that is a right off.  Tried just keeping the account as Canadian, but then I can't buy without verifying with a government ID from Canada, which I don't have given that I am just here on a Work Permit.

So then I tried CoinSquare.io (think that was it) which is Canadian and also requires that government ID.

Tried CoinMama - still waiting on that verification, not sure if it will go through or not but looks like it is manually processed so who knows how long or if ever.

Why is it so hard to just buy Crypto!? Surely this isn't good for health of the coins!

For now I guess I will just keeping mining my small pittance a day (1080ti and 980ti) and try to leverage that in day trades to get more.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to actually buy some darned BTC/BCH/BCC I would be appreciative.  Coinbase LOOKS really nice and most people suggest it.  Shame I can't get them to help me.",1518670018,15/02/2018 04:46:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xo5c5/why_is_it_so_hard_to_buy_bitcoin/,0

Total novice question: How to get at my 2012 bitcoin purchase?,"I’d really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction – thank you ahead of time

I bought some Bitcoin in 2012. I’m a total novice, though: I guess I was into “alternative everything” at the time, and I wanted to buy a book whose author accepted only Bitcoin … so … I bought some Bitcoin. I just discovered a note about this, and I can see that I have a 36-character Bitcoin Wallet (and I have my associated password). I guess bitcoin is big now? How do I get at that bitcoin I bought in 2012? 

I tried to do it like this: I downloaded the Bitcoin app on my Mac, but I can’t figure out how to import the MyWallet I have in my notes. The app asks either for a 12-word recovery phrase or a “backup file” from my computer. I don’t see an option to enter the MyWallet key and … “open” it. Could anyone point me to a how-to resource to do this? I don’t even know what to search for … Thank you to any kind person who will nudge me in the right direction -  Thank you very much!

UPDATE: 

Thank you to everyone for your tips! I’m looking into all of them now. I’ll reply below to each of you, thank you again very much! 

To clarify about the “sort” of info/data that I have: 

First I have what seems to be my login info (to bitcoin.org? to where?): myemail@email.com, Password123.


Next I have a string referring to MyWallet: nnlllnnl-nnll-nnnl-nlnl-nnnlnnnnnnnn; it begins with 5. It looks like I applied Password123 to this MyWallet specifically (?) 


** NOTE: I wrote that this string has 36 characters. That is, it has 36 total characters (including dashes). Excluding dashes, it has 32 characters.** 


Finally I have a second line that I copied and pasted from whatever website I was at: 
“This is your Bitcoin Address”: nnLnnLLlnllLllLlllLLlLlLnLllnLllll; this is a 34-character string. It begins with 1. 


(In these strings, I refer to numbers (n), upper-case Letters (L), and lower-case letters (l)).

"Alright, I just realized I’m doing money wrong way.","I actually need your help. I’m lazy and I’m about to sleep.  
So I appreciate the answers. I really do.

I want to understand the math when averaging down my position

Sorry for the probably wrong/poor vocabulary.  But let’s try:

Thinking on long bias - when I buy more shares at a lower price, how do I calculate my new average cost.

One more try:
 
I want to know so when I catch a bounce on the chart, I buy the z shares to make sure I’ll profit when the price bounces n%

Does that make sense? 
I’m about to know :s

I hope I’m understanding the context (new to block chain) and I hope u understood my question o.O’
otherwise I’ll feel bad.

Peace.

"🔑Supporting Let's Encrypt, 🐶pet rescue, 🏞river protection. And how we hilariously thwarted a scammer. 😄","Hello bitcoiners! I hope the recent rally has been making you happy. I'm here to share probably the second last Pineapple Fund update, and hilarious logs of an attempted scammer getting what they deserve. 

First:

* I donated $250k to Let's Encrypt. Started by Mozilla alumni, they provide free, automated TLS certificates to secure the web. With an annual budget of $3m, they're on track to encrypt more than 120 MILLION websites!

* I'm making a $1 million donation to Nuzzles and Co. They are a small, no-kill shelter in Utah, and they're even serving the Ute and Navajo Native American Reservations. This donation will help Nuzzles pay off their hefty mortgage on their rescue branch, increasing their sustainability and reducing their expenses forever!

* Also donated $250k to the Tennessee River Gorge Trust, a nonprofit protecting 17,000 acres of the Gorge since 1981. This donation will go towards not only land acquisition, but also water quality and migratory bird research projects.

* $1 million to SoGal Foundation, a newly established nonprofit from SoGal Ventures with a mission of closing the gender gap in entrepreneurship and venture capital. I'm excited by what they can do!

* $250k to Many Hopes, who are rescuing children from abuse and poverty, providing education and support, and with the goal of creating intergenerational change.

I also want to share a hilarious story of how Pineapple Fund supporters helped thwart a scammer. A month ago, I receive a reddit PM from a user who claimed to have inside information that Pineapple Fund was scammed by a dummy organization. That caught my attention, so I did a comprehensive review of all funded applicants and transactions. Everything looked right.

I emailed back, asking for more information. This person sent me a screenshot, of a forum post where someone claimed to have stolen from the Pineapple Fund. Some things about it looked very off, and the person seemed to want some money to divulge more information. As someone who's been in crypto for years, I'm always vigilant and smelled a scam.

After a re-audit of our donations, I'm confident that every single donation reached its intended target. Not wanting to leave any stones unturned, I sent the screenshot to a couple of whitehats who had offered help to the Pineapple Fund.

A little while later, they were able to identify the forum. It was of a popular, invite-only torrent tracker, and the scammer used its layout as a base and Inspect Elemented a thread to make it about the Pineapple Fund. The usernames and avatars in the doctored screenshot were real users. Case solved, scam confirmed. But that's not it.

Our whitehat then got in touch with the forum admins, and they were even able to find the thread in question. Because it was an old thread, only one person visited it in 2018. I received the screenshot from the scammer minutes after that visit. The admins banned the user.

A while later, the scammer tried get in touch and make amends with the admin. I'll let the hilarious logs do the talking. This was sent to me by the whitehat. Thank you 'Pim', and thank you to the admins of the site! &lt;3

https://pineapplefund.org/lol.txt

Anyways. Pineapple Fund has a few hundred bitcoins left. It's been an amazing experiment in charitable giving, and I'm looking forward to the final contributions and sharing my learnings.

I'm also looking forward to concluding the Pineapple Fund with an awesome puzzle filled with prizes. If you've ever wanted some money from the Pineapple Fund* as an individual... well, you will have a chance, but you'll have to earn it with your puzzle-solving skills :) 

I'm excited to be working with brilliant artists, puzzle makers, and even a legend who you may know. Stay tuned! 

*All puzzle money will be donated by me personally, and will not come from PF funds or donations :)

A possible scenario to overcome Selfish Mining and 51% attacks,"Today I was reading an article about the outstanding threats to Bitcoin and I found out that most of them were related to manipulation of POW as opposed to other potential threats such as quantum computing, catastrophic bug, network attacks,etc.

I have a somewhat optimistic view of the POW market in the future and I'd like to share it and hear comments about it. 

As ASICs become more energy efficient, old mining hardware becomes obsolete, it still works but is not economically viable. Also I take it for a fact that new generations of ASICs will increment the efficiency (hash/joule) with decreasing returns.

Let's imagine a point in the future where we have a significant portion of hashpower turned off for economic reasons and miners are getting a significant revenue from fees. After mining a block X variance intervenes and we have a long wait for block X+1, fees start to accumulate up to a point that it becomes economic to fire up old miners, temporarily increasing the hashpower and reducing the expected discovery time. This operation will be automatic and I wonder if it is not being used today.

If you think the above mining strategy is possible then think of one of its consequences: A dissuasive reserve army that can enter the market and mine at a loss if there is a selfish mining or a 51% attack.

(*) Mining at an apparent loss (mining rewards + fees does not cover electricity bill) can be economically sound for a hodler because the threat of a 51% attack reduces the price of Bitcoin. Also for ideological reasons.

Bitcoin and Digital products (art especially) have a good chance of fulfilling the 'happily ever after' phrase.,"I only heard about the possibility of exchanging bitcoins for digital products last year. I am a digital artist so I was very excited when I heard about that option (via the Iconic Digital Biennale). 

I honestly feel that could be the way forward for selling digital art and products, downloadable files especially.

I have been searching for websites that offer a digital goods-crypto exchange.

I came across a few, I think these are top: 


COINMALL (https://www.coinmall.com/) - (It seems promising but i feel there is still work to be done).


OPENBAZAAR (https://www.openbazaar.org/) - (It seems like a very good idea seeing as it is decentralized and all, but there is this aura of unsafety you get while using it). 


ROCKETR (https://rocketr.net/)- The best one (in my opinion). Though I haven't used it for long, it seems well structured and the furthest ahead among the three. I just put a few of my works there  (https://rocketr.net/sellers/Befibrillator)... More of my works are here (www.befibrillator.com) if anyone is interested. 

I also came across a site called MAECENAS (https://www.maecenas.co/), where you can own a share of famous paintings but it seems a bit complicated for the random artist.


Anyway, what do you guys think about the future of digital downloadable goods and Cryptocurrencies, and what are the top sites or most promising ones in your opinion??",1518711759,15/02/2018 16:22:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xrfz6/bitcoin_and_digital_products_art_especially_have/,2

Get wallet balance with XPUB per 31.12.2017,"I am looking for a wallet that can import multiple extended public keys (XPUB) and display the balance for a specific date. 


Why? In Switzerland, bitcoin is taxed as property, so only property tax (about 0.2%) has to be payed for the market value you are holding at the end of the year. No capital gains tax is applicable, unless you're a professional trader. I think that's more than fair and (if known in advance) very easy to calculate.

However, I learned that a few days ago. And heck, how can I get a screenshot of my holdings, as they are on multiple hardware wallets and none have to functionality to display the wallet balance for a specific date.

What is the Best UK exchange to convert fiat into Bitcoin FAST?,"Hi. So last week I decided to commit and buy my first Bitcoin whilst the price was low! I initiated a transfer from my UK bank account to Coinbase... A week later and they still haven't got it. I phoned my bank and they said the money was sent, they also said that Coinbase have a three week backlog - which I was surprised the guy knew anything about them. Now the value has almost doubled and I'm cursing there was not a better company to do this and my chance to get in this game.

Now I used Coinbase because they have a reputation for being the least likely to go under. But I have found their customer service non-existent. I had a friend send money into her new account twice for it to be returned twice! I've wondered if this is a sign of a company with problems.

Anyway. Does anybody know a reputable UK company that you can send fiat into and they will receive it in a reasonable amount time, like 3 days?",1518722808,15/02/2018 19:26:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xstkh/what_is_the_best_uk_exchange_to_convert_fiat_into/,0

Coinbase Multiple Charges,"As of yesterday, many Coinbase users are experiencing multiple identical charges on their bank accounts if they have authorized a debit card transaction to buy crypto over the last few weeks. Check your statements to make sure this hasn’t affected you! Coinbase is aware of the problem as of today.

If it has affected you, submit a ticket. I removed all of my card info and bank account and placed a stop of any additional charges on my card. I also made sure my bank was aware by calling them to let them know and they said if it remains pending and goes away then I will not have to worry about overdraft fees.

Personally caused an overdraft on my bank account of over $200. (transaction was over $400)

"Why sell any Bitcoin, if allegedly fiat money is losing value and will be useless in the future?","So I read several posts on different places, that many people have a target for cashing out (25k or 50k USD/BTC for example), some plan to HODL Bitcoin for a few years, then cash out.

What is strange for me is, that many people boast that they are in this for the technology.....but still at a certain price, they would be willing to exchange their BTC back to fiat.

To me this seems like, that if you really say BTC is the future, and fiat money is losing value and will be useless, yet STILL have any fiat money value in mind, where you would considering selling your BTC back to fiat, then you were full of shit for the whole time (and maybe bullshitting yourself as well), and you wre only in this for the fiat gains.

Why is bitcoin wiki promoting scam sites?,"https://en.bitcoin.it is often referred by people for learning about bitcoin. I learned about this in a tutorial video. I of course do not see it as a reliable source of information. 

But it sure is promoting scam sites for sure. And that most likely contributes to people getting scam cause it has a little bit of credibility to it.

My complain is specifically about this page: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MegaChange.is this is clearly a scam site with fake social links. I got scammed for 31$ (thank goodness I always check new sites with the minimum) but some other people are reporting 100+ $ scams. See more: https://www.okchanger.com/exchangers/megachange-is

What I love most about bitcoin is how the bad guys just can't take it over.,"As long as there is a community fighting for integrity, scarcity, censorship-resistance, fungibility, decentralization, open source, great engineering, privacy and immutability, bitcoin cannot be stopped.

By sticking to bitcoin's principles, which it is brilliantly designed to preserve, the community shrugs off any and every attack that has been devised to destroy or to take over bitcoin.

What I hope newcomers will see with a little patience (or through a little study of the history of bitcoin) is that even the most powerful threats have all melted away in time.

Here's what we survived in the last year as a short list:

Big Corporate Miners refusing to activate segwit because it would reduce transaction fees capitulated when the community launched a User Activated Soft Fork;

Big Bitcoin Companies tried to take over the core reference client and hard fork bitcoin but totally capitulated when the community refused to ""upgrade"" to their shitty new software that didn't have the engineers we wanted involved.

A hard fork that pretended to be bitcoin and was very aggressively and fraudulently marketed as ""the true bitcoin"" failed to persuade anybody but the most naive users of its value.

Thousands of altcoins and ICOs with no better technology or even a working product were launched and marketed as the replacement for bitcoin, and they will face their moments of truth soon enough.  

We did launch SegWit.

Lightning Network is alive now.  It's small, but growing and it's incredible.  Like bitcoin itself, it actually can't be stopped now!  That's because it was built with the same principles of bitcoin.

What an incredible place to be at this time!

Legality of Bitcoin in Ghana,"Despite previous announcements, which had came from career bureaucrats within Ghanaian government hinting on a possibility for crypto-currencies to be legalized, in January 2018 the Central Bank's official representative announced that trading and using digital money in Ghana stops to be legitimate and will be persecuted.

For a country with a reputation for embracing technological creativity this ill-advise resolution promulgated by orthodox officeholders won't do more than just decelerating innovations. It will also be impossible to fully implement as Internet penetration rate continues to grow rapidly granting easy access to various detection avoidance tools. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is forced to go underground in Ghana.

deannolan bitcoin donation update** (helpvenezuelans),"Hi, since many people seem to have been wondering about what happened or are expecting to see the results i'm creating this thread to clear any doubts, since it was here where it all started.

Back in December deannoal made 1 bitcoin donations to 25 different charities/organizations, and he donated 1 bitcoin to me, i'm not really an organization but i do run a small charity on my own, or did heavily back then in December, it was me and a friend who were constantly going out and helping homeless and hungry people with food, medicine and other things that we could help with.

Before november/december it was just something casual we would do on our own from time to time, but when i came here and became active on this sub and then began writing about why i consider our country to be the prime example of why a form of payment such as bitcoin is really important, people became curious and asked me further and further questions about how the situation here is in detail and why it became that way, when i mentioned about how tough it was for most people, a lot of kind guys offered to help, some even gave some donations to me, and when i mentioned i had used those to feed people that actually needed it because i did not really need that money for myself since i luckily work online and get paid from clients in the US and other countries, people suggested i open a website to further receive donations and further help, and that's what i did, and it was great in the beginning because it was really manageable, we were able to clear those donations in days while doing it in a really small scale, the one bitcoin donation however would turn us in a bigger scale operation and i was really happy to be able to help that much, we could even help institutions such as hospitals and other places with that amount of money.

However, after sometime i decided it wasn't worth the risk for me and my family, i made an update on the website back in January when the decision was taken so i'm going to paste it here:

&gt;""I had to think this for a long time, but here is what i have decided to do:

&gt;Due to the huge risk factor i have decided to cancel this project, i had to notify the institutions i was going to work with that i no longer was able to provide what i initially said i would.

&gt;A lot of people warned me against doing this, and i became specifically afraid of the high interest this brought onto me, my reddit account is anonymous, but if i completed the project it would become clear what my real identity is both by posting pictures/videos online on the website and on my reddit profile and people comparing them to other pictures that would be posted online by third parties, they would easily find out who i am by asking around, this is a fact because the project was big enough to involve thousands of people thus everyone would be talking about it once completed and pictures and videos would be taken all over the place and shared everywhere by everyone.

&gt;I don't want that risk, thugs easily kill other people for less than $10 in this country, and since i care a lot about myself and my family i sadly won't take that risk even if it means not helping thousands of people.

&gt;The donation has been refunded back to reddit.com/user/deannolan, i have been chatting to him and he has been understanding of the situation.

&gt;I have continued and will continue to provide help on a small scale a few days a week like i have been doing since the start of this, but won't do anything big enough that would draw even the tiniest bit of attention towards me.

&gt;Also please stop contacting me asking to meet me in real life or asking me to provide identity details. I will remain anonymous and won't ever reveal my identity no matter what, i have spoken about how risky it is so please understand. Thanks.""

For proof, you could check any of the donation related threads [deannolan](https://www.reddit.com/user/deannolan/submitted/) made, there you will find that the donation he made was refunded.

We won't be accepting donations anymore, and i'm going to be removing the addresses from the site as well, we will continue helping those that need from time to time as right now it's harder to even purchase food, medicine or anything really even if you have the money to do so, inflation has made shelves really, really empty. 

Thanks for everything in behalf of everyone i was/have been able to help.",1518746447,16/02/2018 02:00:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xvi2h/deannolan_bitcoin_donation_update_helpvenezuelans/,0

edit: after looking at my bank they took 15 dollars out for no reason and put it back in along with 50 dollars so i dont know if its coincidence its the same amount as my feb.3 purchases but its a fuck up on coinbase's side.",1518747146,16/02/2018 02:12:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xvkl9/coinbase_gave_me_my_money_back/,0

Warning for new players with respect to private keys,"As you keep hearing, if you don't own the private key, you don't own the coins.

But the private key should not be thought of like a house key. If I misplace my house key when I am down the street, the chance of someone breaking into my house with my key they find is very very low. The reason for this is that they do not know who lost it, and as such they do not know where I live - so they have a key that they can not use.

Your private key does not work like this, someone only needs your private key (and that its a specific coin private key) and they have all your coin. They do not need your public key.

Keep those private keys very safe.  
Its a good idea to encrypt your private key, but of course then you have to remember this password.
If you print them out, do not write on them 'Bitcoin Private Key'.
If you print them out, its a good idea to divide the key in half, and store them at different locations.
If you print them out, its a good idea to make multiple copies and store them in different locations.


For those without the funds for a trezor/ledger, how do you all keep your paper wallet private keys safe?

Can somebody please explain the HFT bots to me?,"Every exchange seems to be run/controlled/manipulated by HFT bots with profitable algorithms. 

HOLDr's are nothing. 

All the action comes from HFT algorithms. Going non-stop 24/7. Buy low, sell high probably a million times in a second in a country were they don't get taxed.

They are trading cents a million times a second. 

Same thing happens in the Stock Market and Banks,
but at least they have support, insurance, backup, etc.

Ohh, I have 179 BTC but I forgot my paper wallet code.

I had a Treznor but I lost it. It had my life savings.

Damm. It evaporated. Sorry.

Please convince me.

Do you really think They will decentralize money? 

That means all control is lost.

Do you really want to live in a country where nobody is in control?

Success buying Steam Wallet Codes at SteamGamesBTC.com :D,"After seeing quite a few people posting positive things here and there about the website and failing to see anything negative about it, I decided to risk it and see how it goes. I purchased a $20USD Steam Wallet Code from the site, paid the [0.00207ish BTC](https://blockchain.info/tx/9719177ba93de59ad4c52357e4fc08bbd46d45b6ab56d2e1104e93c09e8c4bcb), had it confirmed relatively soon... and the site spat out a transaction number so I could keep track of it.

Some of the things on the site are readily available and will instantly be sent to you once your transaction is confirmed, I assume that the admin keeps a little bit of a backlog for the more popular items. For other items the website says they will have a 24 hour or less processing delay, I assume this is so the admin can check in and purchase the item and email you the code after your transaction confirms.

The whole process for me took a little less than four hours from sending at 10:35PM (CST here) and then a quick confirmation and long-ish processing and finally I got my email at 2:03AM when I was still, for some foolish reason, still awake. The steam wallet code confirmed right away and credited about $24USD to my account since it was converting from EUR for some reason... Not that I'm complaining :)

I think the delay isn't bad, and some people seem to get their stuff faster, just depends on when the admin is on. There's a live chat group on the website that anyone can register for and join to chat with the admin. Hours when the admin is online will probably have faster turnarounds. And I think the turnarounds are fast enough that you should be able to jump on any Steam sales that pop up.

I'm not going to discuss at length whether you should use your bitcoin or save it in hopes the value will increase drastically and you can cash out a millionaire... That's just not an argument I want to have. I try to keep some in my accounts for fun, but since I've not invested any significant amount of actual money or even really much time into it I don't feel a huge loss when spending it. Right now my gaming computer slowly generates income for me - it buys its own games (at the cost of some electricity but still profitable here). And, hey, that's pretty cool!

Here's a link to the site: [SteamGamesBTC.com](http://steamgamesbtc.com/index.php)

I'm not in any way paid by or affiliated with the site, I just wanted to be able to provide another +1 for its reputation since it worked great for me :)

Are there any other sites that offer services like this? It would be cool if we could put together a list of reputable sites that people could really rely on and feel safe using. I know it would definitely help newer people like me feel more comfortable using their bitcoin and maybe make them more confident in the system and more likely to keep putting into it and driving up the value for all of us.",1518771758,16/02/2018 09:02:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xxjkl/success_buying_steam_wallet_codes_at/,1

From where I can buy bitcoin using my credit-card while in Pakistan from a site similar to Coinbase and not P2P or meeting physically?,"Hello everyone,


I live in Pakistan. I want to buy bitcoin, not much maybe just USD $100 or even fewer. I never bought bitcoin before. I would like to buy using my credit-card through some most reliable famous website, something similar to Coinbase or some other reliable exchange. However, Coinbase doesn't allow me (from Pakistan) to buy/sell bitcoin.


I don't want to buy from Pakistani websites. Most of them are sketchy at best and unreliable. 


I also don't want to buy by physically meeting anyone locally. Sketchy and scary as hell in Pakistan (don't want to be kidnapped, robbed and murdered).


I am also avoiding P2P exchanges, seems sketchy for a first time buyer like me. What if I send money and don't get bitcoin in return. Moreover, I would like to buy using my credit-card.


I am hoping that any of you may guide me in the right direction.

F2Pool is the 6th biggest pool, though its share of total hash power is declining as the chart at the bottom of [this page](https://btc.com/stats/pool) shows (mouseover shows figures).

The transactions hash is the same size regardless of the number of transactions it represents - the mining cost comes in hashing the transactions hash with zillions of nonces: mining unfull blocks amounts to leaving free money on the table.

Where to learn more about Bitcoin?,"Obvious throwaway.

First started reading up on Bitcoin since 2013 but only actually buying some back in 2017 - since then I've sold and brought back in a few times times for a small profit.

Currently sitting out looking in and deciding whether to buy back in, roughly 1 whole BTC.

I 100% believe in blockchain technology (from what I understand) but have many fears Bitcoin isn't what it was back in 2013 and is now:

a) too volatile and expensive to be used as a currency
b) too volatile to be used as a store of value

Looking at the current state of affairs, the users in r/bitcoin and on social media seems to be increasingly made up of young adults buying into bitcoin in the hope of making quick money and buying Lambo's and the real bitcoiners have since sold and left.

Can anyone genuinely point me in the direction of some sensible reassuring talks or articles on bitcoin and it's future?

Reducing the risk profile of custody with custody channels,"Right now CBOE and CME have issued high margin, high risk futures contracts.   Sellers of contracts have no way to provide margin in Bitcoin.   The result of this can be margin requirements in excess of 200% on short contracts.  And this is fully justified by the recent volatility.

What if CBOE allowed for margin to be supplied in Bitcoin?   Well then the CBOE is taking another massive operational risk.  Bitcoin, as a purely digital asset, is notoriously hard to secure... especially in hot wallet accounts used for daily margin requirements.

What if the CBOE accepted its margin as a commitment transaction on payment whose destination was a cold wallet... but didn't actually broadcast the transaction.

Essentially, the customer could establish time locked funds and then sign a transaction moving those funds to CBOE's cold storage.   But rather than broadcast  the transaction, CBOE can simply hold on to the transaction... only broadcasting if the customer attempts to move the funds (which it has plenty of time to do so, since they are time locked).

Now the risk profile and attack surface of a margin account has vastly changed.   CBOE no longer holds funds in a hot wallet... instead they hold transactions that *could* be used to move funds to cold storage... but often will *never* be used.

By moving the risk from hot to cold storage, from real transactions to ephemeral signed transactions, insurance can be vastly reduced and the cost of futures and the margins required can also be reduced.",1518791901,16/02/2018 14:38:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xz4fv/reducing_the_risk_profile_of_custody_with_custody/,11

How should I handle Refunds and Late Billing for BTC Customers?,"*TLDR:  When the Bitcoin price changes and you have to ""do stuff"" with old orders (refund, or rebill), do you use the current BTC price?  Or the BTC price from the day of the order?   Depending on how the BTC value has changed, it will result in a loss of money for one party.*

.

-----

~Scenario 1:~  

Customer checked out with BitPay.  Paid with BTC.   Order shipped.  BTC was never collected by the API.  No idea why.   So we need to bill them now.   2 months later.  BTC Price is different now.  0.0002 in December may be 0.0006 today.   If the price change works out in their favor, no problem.  We bill them less BTC's today than they intended to part with in December.   If the price change doesn't work in their favor, they're not going to be willing.  Unlike USD, $100 in December isn't still $100 in February.  

***Do we bill them the current USD equivalent in BTC and tell them to deal with it?  Or do we bill them the same BTC amount they tried to pay with in December?***

-----

~Scenario 2:~  

Similar situation.  Refunds.  Customer paid (hypothetical) 0.0002 BTC in December and never got their product.  Or decides to return it.  If the BTC price difference works out in their favor, then Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy.   If it doesn't, they arent going to be willing to part with more of their precious BTC's just because we failed to collect in December.  ""Why should I have to pay 0.06 for the same thing when I only had to part with 0.02 to get it in December?""

***Do we refund them the original BTC amount, or do we refund them the BTC amount based on current USD prices?***",1518795185,16/02/2018 15:33:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xzh1q/how_should_i_handle_refunds_and_late_billing_for/,1

What will happen to bitcoin in 2140?,"Bitcoin has recently been on the marquee... sometimes it is growing, sometimes, its rate is plummeting...as you know, only 21 million bitcoins are available for mining.

Does this mean that all people are going to burn their farms and to spend money on an intergalactic yacht -this fact is unknown. 


However, it is possible that bitcoin, like any other currency, will be divided into smaller units - Satoshi. And Satoshi can become a trade unit, while bitcoin will be used only for big calculations.Nowadays, may be a commission of 10 thousand Satoshi sounds unrealistic and seems unprofitable and meaningless, but in the future it may change.

Non-mining nodes.,"So, I have been spending too much time in another sub. (I suffer from a tad of https://xkcd.com/386/)

I have a hard time getting *anyone* there, *anyone* at all, to agree with my view. So, I'd like some balanced comments, from 

I am talking about the value independent nodes play in determining which hardfork has value.

Please hear me out, and tell me where I am wrong:

Let's say 70% of miners decide to change the rules.
  - Examples: Add one extra mandatory output to themselves, that doesn't need to have a valid signature. Can be done, if they are the ones who validate the rules...
 - Decides to stop validating signatures and treat Segwit as anyone-can-spend (already done on a competing coin)

Now, all else being equal, the majority chain would win. But there would be two chains, not compatible. If mining nodes were those that decided whether or not transactions was valid, it's a given which side would win - right?

But ok. The economic part of the ecosystem is not interested in that. They'll not perform those changes, and will still only accept coins mined by the 30% minority chain.

I am arguing that the minority chain is doomed to win in this case, unless they actually manage to fool the non-mining nodes to run that hard-fork too...and why would they?

The majority chain would of course have majority hash power, but their *market* would be reduced to an internal market equal to the miners...am I still correct?

So, only the 30% remaining honest miners coins could actually be spent, and eventually DAA would come in...and adjust difficulty so that blocks were still 6 per hour. Still correct?

How would this not reduce the 70% majority (which were obviously dishonest so hardly any external actors would give value to the coin) to more or less a miners toy they can transact with each others?

Please correct or improve on my world view.",1518797308,16/02/2018 16:08:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7xzq2c/nonmining_nodes/,3
Bitcoin.tax Help,"I imported 2013/14/17 data from Coinbase (csv) and GDAX (api). Purchases from 2013/14 made through Coinbase were sent to cold storage and first traded in 2017 on GDAX.

Can we commition some good educational videos?,"There are some players in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that have som good quality videos. The problem with them, however, is that the ones I have seen is *full* of misleading and false information.

Now, within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, this isn't really a problem. We know good information from bad information. The problem is, the ecosystem is *growing* a lot these days - and a lot of the new people not understanding key concepts, and will buy into the information in the videos.

I will be willing to pay some BTC - not a lot, because I don't have *that much* - but it would be in the hundredths of a BTC range :) With some more people chipping in, it might actually be worth it for someone.

I'll try to describe my first one with words. It's the one about why full nodes matter.

It will piction miners in the central of the movie, all mining bitcoins. Then, it'll add nodes to the ecosystem. Nodes will validate/look at the coins, and determine whether it's a bitcoin or not. Then, goods (for example coffee cups) and money will flow the other way, to the miners. The money will flow out the other end, towards the electricity company, which is the bills that the miners have to pay.

Now, we'll picture some of the miners - let's say 70% - of the miners going rogue. This, I want to picture with a pirate flag instead of the bitcoin system, and the bitcoin turning black. It's bitcoins that has changed.

Now, we'll need to picture what happens when those black bitcoins get to the full nodes. No goods or money will flow the other way. Eventually, the power company will want money, and we'll picture a sad miner with no money in his pockets.

We'll compare that to the 30% of miners mining true bitcoins, sending it to the nodes, and coffee and money flows as before.

For this comparision to work properly, I think we might need to have external people using the full nodes to validate.

Now, we need to change this picture. We'll need to remove the full nodes, and have the external people use the full nodes of the miners to validate instead. The users trusting the miners nodes will still give coffee and money to the miners. Now, we'll need to picture what happens after a while:
The users having used the rogue miners to validate will be sad, and hold bad bitcoins, while the users having used good miners will be happy, with good bitcoins.

There has to be a good narrative here voice, here, describing the ways bitcoins can be ""fake"", the rules having changed, suddenly there having been printed more bitcoins than 21 million, signatures not being validated, etc. We don't want to create FUD videos either, this has to be realistic scenarios.

What do you think? Does anyone here have the means and artistic knowledge to do this, or know someone who does? I'll be willing to chip in a small BTC payment for it.",1518802195,16/02/2018 17:29:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7y0c3n/can_we_commition_some_good_educational_videos/,0

How can i get a list of all transactions belonging to one wallet if i don't have the extended pub key?,"Hi,

is there an easy way to get a list of all transactions from a public key without having the extended pub key?

All spend / send and UTXO?

I'm playing around with an accounting tool and i want people to just insert their pub-key in order to fetch all transactions that belong to that ""wallet"".

Thanks

Mixing using your own wallets.,"Would it be possible to mix coins using your own ephemeral wallets.

This would be to disguise the source of your coins.

There are many legitimate reasons for doing so.  For example if you are a organization in country A trying to help out people being prosecuted in country B.  You want to publish your main wallet ID but don't want officials in country B to persecute people that donated to your wallet.

I think it would be possible to just generate ephemeral wallets, split your coins between, them, do this multiple times, then transfer to the original target.

The problem though is that I think graph analysis could be used to plausibly prove that these nodes are highly connected.

It would be difficult to do but possible.

Has anyone done research in this area?",1518819432,16/02/2018 22:17:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7y2ekb/mixing_using_your_own_wallets/,2

How does one change the current system while expecting absolutely no help from it?,"This isn't going to be one of those conspiracy posts. We have a system. It isn't perfect, but it works. Bitcoin on the other hand is a system that a lot more of us can use. It's basically an upgrade.

The best part about it is that if 99.9% of bitcoin is owned by 1% of the population then bitcoin will just be worthless. As opposed to Fiat it actually encourages spending. It doesn't promote hoarding huge amounts and then using it to manipulate the market.

The FUD about bitcoin not being environmentally friendly is ridiculous. Think about how many banks exist, how many branches they all have and how much electricity it takes to power a single one. Now think about how much electricity it takes to power the bitcoin network. A case can definitely be put towards shutting one of them down.

How would you improve the network? Segwit seems to fix transaction fees. Lightning will make micro-payments accessible. What about public services? That's usually the main concern: the safety and wellbeing of people. Do you feel safe and well? Do we restructure and create common bitcoin funds? What are your thoughts?

If you want a new system to work you have to make the old one obsolete.

I can't seem to recover coins from a 12-worded seed in Electrum or Mycelium,"Hi, I'm sorry for annoying readers about this issue again but there wasn't a plausible fix in the other topics listed below and I would have posted there but seeing as they've been archived/closed for close to a year and over a year I can't post continuing remarks there. I would have also made the following remarks in bitcointalk.org where it's more suited but they require a fee to post which I don't mind except I can't retrieve my coins to pay them. So it will be further helpful if an individual wouldn't mind posting this link in the right place as well.

I'm of the bunch that has a 12-worded seed and can't recover the coins successfully even with BIP39 enabled in the latest version of Electrum and yes I have used an older version to recover unsuccessfully. I'm facing exactly what this person went through only unlike that person, I truly only have 12 words - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1898620.msg18844435;topicseen

I found this possibly plausible method, only this person offers a suggestion of recovering coins from Mycellium on to Electrum, I figured I could do the opposite, however, it came back with checksum invalid or something along those lines.

As for the other method by iancoleman, I could really get a handle of how to properly work it kept showing 'invalid mnemonic' at the top. Perhaps someone could suggest a way of tweaking the settings because iancoleman's methods seems like a good solution if someone knows how to properly work it. 

I've checked the word list in Github to find the words are actually in the list and that I've correctly wrote it down checking numerously. So in Mycelium and Electrum it says something like 'checksum invalid', in https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/recover It doesn't continue and in https://blockchain.info/wallet/forgot-password it says ""word 'legend' is unknown"" which I can't see how that can be considering it's in the Github list.
 
I'd really appreciate anybody’s advice of a better and effective way for recovering coins because in the below links nobody such as @Midar3 @ThomasV1 @bookposting5 @MengerianMango @Zatouroffski really confirmed an actual fix for the issue. I should probably also note that I initially created the Electrum wallet in Windows and now using it in Linux Mint.  Thanks

Getting kids into crypto.,"12 year old nephew came over with his mom and sister today.
His birthday is coming quick, so I told him to have his mom buy him some bitcoin to hodl for him. He became very inquisitive and started asking me all kinds of questions. We talked about a maximum of 21 m coins, breaking them down into smaller sizes, and future projections. 

He put the hard sell on his mom to get him100$ but she blew it off. Can’t lie I was hoping she’d fold and buy off of conbase to get me a referral bonus.

A few minutes later my wife gave the kid 20$ for his birthday. He came to me and asked if he could buy some bitcoin. I locked him in at 10,393.95 with .001924 btc. Kid downloaded Blockfolio and started tracking. I was rolling watching him rage at mom that he could of 5xed his gains.

I told him that this is locked up until he is 18, but if he gets dumb and wants to cash it out at any point, I’ll gladly give his mom the money and keep Hodling it my own self.

We are now bitcoin bros.

Just was a cute interaction. Hope he makes it and so do we!

Edit: found this kid on the internet, nephew is eating them up. https://youtu.be/2AawrjIxqdM

Intent wasn’t to get the referral from “conbase”,  just gave him options. With Coinbase dealing with their latest scandal I doubt she’d of been able to get verified anyway.",1518855167,17/02/2018 08:12:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7y5h3z/getting_kids_into_crypto/,186

Multi-bit Wallet (0.5.14),"Hi,

I’ve used in the past my multibit wallet to store my bitcoin. Not even the Multibit HD version but Multibit 0.5.14 which for a while now has no support of any kind. (https://multibit.org)

When I restart Blockchain and transactions register it tells me I got still coins left in my wallet but due too low fees that were used before (I guess) I can’t get them out in any way. Is there any solution that you guys might know? Some fee bumping extraction method or anything a like?

Thanks in advance and if you manage it I’ll give you some.

A Crypto World dominated by Bots,"I have been studying and test trying PT and thinking about Feeder to for a couple of weeks now.

Before that I just traded manually on different exchanges and was easy to notice that the number of orders placed and the small increase or not on bids and asks on the order book was clearly bots on the works.

That got me wondering of how many trades are actually done by bots. I guess a big chunk of Crypto markets as well as others markets like Forex, SP500, Nasdaq and Commodities are all just responding to the algorithms of several different trading bots.

Once there is no certainty of de % of trades that are done by bots , there is still a recurring question...

If more that 80% of trades are bots trading (maybe higher), and there are a lot of similar setting and algos doing the same thing at the same time, who would win the game?

It is almost like a regular poker player (fish) sitting on a Vegas Table full of professional players (sharks) just waiting for the daily meal... 😅

But, there is a final question for this... If most bots don’t place any orders on the exchanges, but just monitor the markets, indicators, volume  , etc... waiting for the best time to enter (buy) or exit (sell), how would the market react, if there were no order placed att all. It would stand still ? Would it just freeze ?

I think as time goes by, more and more bots will be doing the trades, and when this % goes over a certain critical number, the market will be just sitting still, with no trades and low volume, since the bots will only be waiting for each other to make a move.

At the end, the fastest bot to draw its weapons and shoot will win...

A Day of Grace and Leadership!,"It seams the miners are not taking in transactions over 5sat/B these days, under that some won't touch.  Thus our new technology, The BlockChain, is constantly filthy with low specs of transaction fee errors or NOOB try outs.  Mistakes, errors, and or deliberate low fee transactions should be cleared from the mempool once in a while, that is the transaction count should be brought down to zero.

For this a trend has to be created.  A day of grace where we don't uses the blockchain, 3 or 4 times a year, on a specific date where transactions are reduced by the users, in order to let miners either mine empty blocks for a full day or catch what specs may linger in the mempool.

This could be on the dates of the four seasons, days where we move time forward or backwards from Daylight Saving Time.  Whatever!

AND
another address below that line with .19 BTC, for a total of -.20710186 BTC.

Lightning network questions.,"Here are some questions I have about the lightning network. If you have any question yourself, feel free to post it and if I know the answer, I will answer it.

1 - As [Andreas explained in a recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4TjfaLgzj4), the lightning network uses source onion routing. This means that each node that routes a payment only knows from which direction the payment comes from, to which direction is going and how much bitcoin is being sent. Is the key that each node uses to decrypt its layer of the onion the same as the private key of the node's public key used to open lightning channels with that node?

2 - If the answer to question 1 is no, then it's possible that a highly connected node like [rompert] (https://rompert.com/recksplorer/), reveals its ""onion"" private key and lets the public know how many payments are routed through him. This make publicly known how many payments that node routes and will allow for a rough estimation of how many payments are being done in the lightning network, right?

3 - Is it possible or will it be possible to run a lightning node and have the private key of that node stored in a hardware wallet? As far as I know, this is not possible with traditional hardware wallets like ledger and trezor because they can only sign messages, not decrypt them like it's necessary for the onion routing of the lightning network.

4 - When the Eclair app for smartphones for mainnet comes out ([testenet version here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.eclair.wallet&amp;hl=en)), will my smartphone be a lightning node?

Bitcoin is FIAT money,"In the classic arguments of Bitcoin vs government issued money that are frequently held in the crypto-scene people are refering to Bitcoin as Bitcoin and the rest as FIAT money.

But by definition, Bitcoin is also FIAT money. Contrary to popular belief, FIAT has nothing to do with the possibility of endless printing. The fact that the maximum supply of Bitcoin is limited doesn't make it any less of a FIAT currency. FIAT simply means that it is money which is created out of ""nothing"" and has no intrinsic value, which is the case for government money as well as Bitcoin. The value comes from the willingness of two parties agreeing on a value. Both are FIAT money, but one is limited.

Using a 6-of-10 MultiSig wallet to store/payout Fantasy Football league dues?,"As the League Manager for our fantasy football team, the question of funds is always a problem. 

Our first few years we simply sent the money digitally to one guy to hold in his checking account. Last year, I was appointed league manager and held the funds in cash. We started the league in high school, and are now going to school across the country. This makes cash a hassle (and unsecure).

A couple of months ago I first started getting into Bitcoin. It has occurred to be a muti-signature wallet would be the perfect way to store funds. 

No trust needed. Completely secure. Not to mention, any price increase over the course of the season would sure go a long way.

The problem? Only 3/10 of the league members know anything about Cypto and I'm really the only one interested in anything other than profit.

I want to design a system that is simple and secure while introducing the rest of the guys to the technical benefits of decentralized cryptocurrency.

I was thinking we could do it like this:

1. One week before the draft, the dues are calculated by rounding up to the closet mBTC. ($100/10,800 = 0.00925925925 BTC = 10 mBTC)
2. We use the [multisig tool on Coinbi.in](https://coinb.in/#newMultiSig) to create a 6-of-10 wallet.
3. Members send 10 mBTC to the wallet before draft (or they lose 30% of their auction budget).
4. At the end of the season, a transaction is created and signed by 7 of the 10 league members.
5. 6.5 mBTC (65%) goes to 1st place, 2 mBTC (20%) goes to 2nd, 1 mBTC (10%) to 3rd, and 0.5 mBTC (5%) to the team with the most regular season points.

From what I understand, it's possible to send coins to multiple addresses at once (using [this tool](https://coinb.in/#newTransaction)), right?  

Can league members use [this tool](https://coinb.in/#newAddress) to create the private/public key combination used to create the multisig wallet and sign the payout transaction?

Is it possible to use the public/private keys from my Ledger Nano S?

Any other tips on doing something like this?",1518907447,17/02/2018 22:44:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ya34l/using_a_6of10_multisig_wallet_to_storepayout/,3
Sodled today,"So a little background, 

I hopped aboard the hype train when btc was 15k in December, applied for an account with Gemini and after about a month and a half, and nearly half the ATH finally bought in at 11k. I was pleased not to have joined at 19k but kinda bummed about the price plummet. After hodling and buying when I could, I amassed a decent enough chunk of bitcoin that the daily market fluctuations drastically affected my approximate dollar equivalent. 

With the recent surge in price, I've broken even with my initial investment and came out with 17.5% gains and the price shows no sign of changing direction. I had made the decision to sell a small portion of coin to be able to purchase a new laptop, and leave the rest so I could continue to trade and hodl. 

However, sometimes life throws you a curveball. My girlfriend and I just signed a lease for a bigger apartment and the day after, she gets laid off from work. While she has some options on where to go job-wise, I just felt it more responsible to liquify some coin and help keep us comfortable. 

I never really had a specific reason to invest in btc, just to say I was apart of it. Never really had a moon I was aiming for, just liked the returns and fact that it's evolving technology that could change the world. 

So since I'm basically back where I started from, I don't worry about missing out on gains or crashes because I know I can always buy back in tomorrow, and start the journey again. 

Happy hodlings everyone",1518907630,17/02/2018 22:47:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ya3us/sodled_today/,5
WARNING to Coinbase Merchants,"TL;DR Trusting coinbase to generate and secure your private key and seed when you sign up for their merchant program is risky and unnecessary.  Think about it this way - If you purchased a trezor or nano that came with its 24 word recovery card filled in for you, would you be comfortable using it?

As a developer who works w/ open source merchant solutions like [BTCPayserver](https://btcpay-server-testnet.azurewebsites.net/) I was excited to see coinbase making their merchant solution available to the masses.  After taking a tour of it though I'm a bit concerned with their implementation. 

After you create an account in the merchant program it appears that they create a BIP-39 wallet on your behalf and then show you your 12 word recovery phrase for said wallet, which you then confirm and send back to them to finish setting up your account.  Coinbase claims they do not store your private key. 

This is problematic for a few reasons - even if you 100% trust coinbase we have no way to know if this information is exposed to other parties via an exploit.  We have no way to tell they are generating these seeds in a secure, non predictable fashion.

Coinbase also says that the ability to withdraw is ""coming soon"" and for now users should recover the wallet with the seed phrase.  I'm curious how they intend to move funds from the wallet address if they indeed aren't storing the private key?

A much better and safer way to do this is to let the user provide a public key (X-pub) for a wallet they control instead.   This still allows for the generation of receive addresses for the merchant to get paid, but since we don't store  or ever see a private their is little for attackers to gain in case of an exploit.

Help with running a full node,"Hi,

I've set up a full node a while ago, and I was able to verify that it works by using Bitnodes ""Join the network"" feature. However, since last week, Bitnodes is returning an error, ""Enter a valid IP address"".

When I run 'bitcoin-cli getinfo' command on the Raspberry Pi, this is what I get:

{
  ""deprecation-warning"": ""WARNING: getinfo is deprecated and will be fully removed in 0.16. Projects should transition to using getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo, and getwalletinfo before upgrading to 0.16"",

}

Clearly I have 17 connections but I don't know why it can't be verified on bitnodes website?

I have already checked my IP address and port forward sharing setting and all seems to be OK.

Also, 17 connections suggest that my node is visible to others..

I just want to make sure that my node is visible. Can someone shed a light on the error from Bitnodes?

"High transaction fees, Long wait times. How stupid can people get?","Everyone seems to think that bitcoin is this epitome of future societal moneta.

Have you guys ever stopped to think what the average person is willing to put up with in terms of purchasing bitcoin in order to actually use it as a CURRENCY?

The last time I purchased bitcoin to make a purchase, it took over 2 hours to receive and I had to pay a $21 processing fee and $5 service fee.

If bitcoin will ever become a currency, it cannot inconvenience people to this degree. If it is to be successful in the long term, the masses must be able to easily utilize it. It is currently, and always will be, a scam for the weak-minded who think they can get rich quick pretending they are savvy investors. 

I pity those that have lost their life savings, and I hope you can heed this warning to stay as far away from crypto currencies as possible until the government is involved and regulates it accordingly.",1518918768,18/02/2018 01:52:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yb8ci/high_transaction_fees_long_wait_times_how_stupid/,0

A cautionary tale regarding coinbase,"On Jan 22nd I wired nearly 10k USD to my coinbase account.  I had been a coinbase/gdax user for nearly 3 months by that point and have never had issues.  This time however the funds hadn't shown up after a week, and when I called the bank I wired it to I was told that they have received the funds with the necessary name and reference number.  I was told that whatever issue that was causing this problem was on coinbase's side.  

Coinbase customer service finally responded on Feb 9th asking for more information (I had already provided all the info when I initially contacted them so this just seemed like a delay tactic)  They contacted me again again on Feb 12th saying they were looking into it.  I have not head back since.

What's unsettling is that once I started following coinbase on twitter, I noticed that tons of other people have been having the same problem, some for 3 months or longer without receiving a response from coinbase.  Think about that for a second: you wire significant amounts of money to a supposedly legitimate and trustworthy institution, only to have your funds lost for months with little to no response from customer service.

I see 3 possibilities here:

1) They are simply too stretched.  Their customer service department hasn't expanded fast enough to keep pace with the growth in customer base.  I don't fully buy this though; how long can it possibly take to sort out missing funds for a handful of customers? The unsettling possibility is that it's not just a handful of customers and it's really a lot more common than people realize.  In my assessment, we're more likely looking at possibilities 2 and 3:

2) Coinbase is effectively co-mingling company and customer funds (which is a big no no for financial institutions).  If this is true, then these funds are basically interest free loans to them, for terms up to 3 months or longer as per the complaints on twitter.  Is the company burning through cash so quickly that they are resorting to forced borrowings from customers?  Are they running out of money?

3) They are sitting on loses from a hack or theft and rather than declaring it they are trying to cover it up by using funds from customers.  Their website says cryptocurrencies and cash held with them are insured, but what about funds in transit?  Are they really as secure as they claim to be?

All of the above is just my speculation, but you now have all been warned.  If I had seen all the replies to their twitter page prior to this I would have moved everything to a different exchange.  They have now robbed me thousands of dollars in gains as the cryptos have rallied as well as the interest on my cash, and I am no closer to locating the original deposit.  Proceed with caution.",1518919407,18/02/2018 02:03:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ybalg/a_cautionary_tale_regarding_coinbase/,9

Legality of Bitcoins in Estonia,"Estonia - the country of Skype - is supposed to be the champion of innovations but in case of crypto-currencies legislation this Baltic nation's regulators demonstrate notable conservatism. First, the Supreme Court of Estonia ruled that Bitcoin falls under the anti-money laundering law, which means that all crypto-currencies mediators must follow AML and KYC procedures. Then the Estonian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA) expressed an opinion that tokens, depending on their structure, might be considered as securities.

Furthermore, following the report that Estonia had proposed launching its own token - the ""Estcoin"", a representative of the European Central Bank stated that ""only the Euro is the legal tender and the monetary policy lies exclusively with the European Central Bank"". That have left a little doubt that the Ministry of Finance and the Estonian Central Bank will fall in line with this out-dated policy.

OpenDime Fails,"I wont recommend anyone to put any bitcoins in OpenDime.

Recently I purchase packet of three (v2). One unsealed by itself. 

Now there is a bigger problem. One of the OpenDimes malfunctioned.

All I did it is to plug it in a computer. The connection seamed wobbly, the lights start blinking and then  stooped.  I moved it slightly trying to plug it in proper and that was it - the OpenDime is bricked. 

As last resort I unsealed the devise, puged it in to other machince. Didn't help.

The Solution to the World’s Toughest Bitcoin Puzzle Is as Clever as Its Creator,"Last week, an enigmatic and fiendishly tricky puzzle that had baffled bitcoiners for years was finally solved. In the process, it earned the individual who cracked it a 5 BTC jackpot and brought new acclaim to the team behind the project. After being launched in 2015, at the height of the bitcoin bear market, the puzzle attracted a flurry of interest. As the months passed and no one stepped forward to claim the prize, interest in the puzzle waned, until last week’s sudden news that its mysteries had been decoded.
So, Did you try to solve the bitcoin puzzle after it was announced in 2015? ",1518934998,18/02/2018 06:23:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ycmna/the_solution_to_the_worlds_toughest_bitcoin/,9

Why is no one talking about the whale that recently purchased approx. 400 million in BTC?,"This is something that is heavily influencing the market right now, yet all I see are posts about how glad hodler's are and ""too the moon"" memes.

&amp;nbsp;

We should be discussing this and the impact it will continue to have on the market. It's been estimated that at the time the whale finished investing to now, the 400 mill has easily turned into 900 mill.

Anyone use bitcoin price as a random number generator for real life?,"I've installed an app on my phone that gives me the bitcoin price on my home screen in real time. I use this as a quasi-random number generator.

For example, I have set up an agreement with many friends to use the last two digits of the bitcoin price to determine who pays for coffee. For example, right now bitcoin price is $10,640. So the last two digits are 40. If it is under 50 then the younger person pays. If it is over 50 then the older person pays. This ensures that over the long run each person pays half, and the benefit of this system is that you don't need to remember who paid before, which is a problem if e.g. you alternate who pays.

Bitcoin price is also useful when e.g. I take my vitamins. As a vegan I take 1000 micrograms of vitamin B12 twice per week. 2/7 is approximately 30% so each day I look at the last two digits of the bitcoin price. If it is below 30, I take a pill otherwise I don't.",1518941110,18/02/2018 08:05:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yd0yv/anyone_use_bitcoin_price_as_a_random_number/,3

Peer-to-peer platform for exchanging crypto to fiat - public release coming soon,"Hi /r/Bitcoin! Thank you for reading this.

We felt the world of digital currencies is a not very secure place still. Although the idea about blockchain and decentralization is not a new thing, many people still use centralized exchanges without no escrow. So we want to create more confidence and security in this world! We're developing new peer-to-peer [platform](https://simpledex.org/?utm_source=reddit) for exchanging crypto to fiat. Please let us know if you have any questions or comments:

We found that current fiat gateways have major limitations:

* User interfaces are **not user-friendly**.
* Unacceptably **high commission rates**, even up to 20% on some platforms.
* **Lack of security**: The sites ask users to deposit their cryptos and fiat without escrow. Why should anyone trust them?
* **No End-2-End encryption**. Private conversations should be encrypted and not available to third-parties, even to the platforms providing you service.
* **Not enough exchanging pairs**
* Super **slow support**. It takes up to 30 days to resolve the issue.

To solve all these problems we want to bring [simpledex](https://simpledex.org/?utm_source=reddit).",1518952285,18/02/2018 11:11:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ydo63/peertopeer_platform_for_exchanging_crypto_to_fiat/,4

bitcoin core node none outgoing connections only incoming connections,"Hi, i did run a core node and did let it sync on my local ssd. It was fast and was done after one night. But i saw that the space was close to 100% used on my ssd. So i bought an external HDD drive and started syncing again. (yes i should have moved my copy of the blockchain to the hdd but i didnt :(  ). The node on the hdd is now syncing since at least a week and the first 50% went relatively fast. and now im down to 0.08% per hour. I have only incoming connections and most times zero outgoing connections. I assume the reason for this is the blocking of my node from the other nodes because im so slow?

Thanks hodlers: BTC daily confirmed transactions way lower than a year ago,"https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions

Everyone in avoiding talking about this, maybe the most important metric when it comes to adoption besides volume. With the current values we should be below $2k. I see no evidence to attribute the drop to a mayor player implementing batching. So when you see people rejoicing that we have a clear mempool now tell them it's because almost no one's using Bitcoin. Maybe lay down on the $40k predictions until we get some adoption.",1518955901,18/02/2018 12:11:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ydvw2/thanks_hodlers_btc_daily_confirmed_transactions/,3

PSA: The biggest threat to Bitcoin at the moment is BitPay,"A few weeks ago BitPay made a change to their payment window, which has far reaching implications.

They do not show a Bitcoin address anymore at all, you only get a link like this: ""bitcoin:?r=https://bitpay.com/i/*****************"". This is called BIP70 standard. How this works from a technological side, is that your wallet no longer sends the transaction directly to the Bitcoin network, but to BitPay, and then BitPay decides whether to publish the transaction to the network, or reject it (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong and/or is I have oversimplified things). By doing this, BitPay literally becomes the gatekeeper deciding which transactions are ""correct"", based on political whims. This already means that BitPay invoices can be paid only with several wallets, as most wallets do not support BIP70 at the moment. While there is nothing wrong with BIP70 per se, what is wrong is that BitPay has made this **mandatory**.

While I do not have any solid proof that BitPay is using this to blacklist addresses / transactions at the moment, it is inevitable that sooner or later they will be forced to not only blacklist some addresses, but more likely to only accept payments from whitelisted addresses. The argument is very simple - up until now, there was no technological way to ""reject"" a Bitcoin transaction. Now, BitPay has implemented a method to do exactly that. Since the method already exists, the governments will no longer accept the excuse that it is impossible, and will force BitPay (and other Bitcoin payment processors) to implement blacklisting / whitelisting. The worst case scenario would be allowing to only accept payments made using centralized wallets with mandatory KYC.

This greatly hurts the fungibility of Bitcoin. The reality is, that most merchants accept bitcoins via BitPay and other Bitcoin payment processors. If I can not use my bitcoins to pay the majority of the merchants, then they are worth less than ""untainted"" bitcoins.

What we, as a community, can do to fight this?

1. Develop and promote privacy / fungibility improvements for Bitcoin. In my opinion, weak fungibility is currently Bitcoin's biggest problem / risk.

2. Boycott BitPay and any other Bitcoin payment processors implementing **mandatory** BIP70.

3. Promote other, socially responsible, pro-Bitcoin payment processors. Contact the stores which use BitPay, and ask them to switch to another payment processor. Explain your reason why you will no longer purchase from them until they switch their processor.

A list of **recommended** Bitcoin payment processors:

CoinGate - https://coingate.com/accept-bitcoin

Coinpayments - https://www.coinpayments.net

CoinsBank - https://coinsbank.com/merchant

Why some other payment processors are **not recommended**:

Coinbase - did not integrate SegWit yet, purposefully spammed the network (no transaction batching) to create a transaction backlog and raise the fees: http://bitcoinist.com/mempool-coinbase-spamming-bitcoin/ , supported SegWit2x attack: http://segwit.party/nya/list/

Pay off the US National Debt with only $200B?,"I was thinking about the relationship between the US Federal govt and Bitcoin recently.  Suppose the price of a Bitcoin went to $1M. That’s roughly 100X of the current price.  If the US FEd govt bought $200B worth of Bitcoin and the price went to $1M, their holdings would be worth $20T which is the size of the national debt. 

Of course, one minor problem is that there is only $160B Bitcoins now.    

So then you say, if we had $20T bitcoin and $20T debt, do you pay it off or HODL??!!   

Anyway, I predict govts around the world will begin investing in Bitcoin and probably already are.

Would you take your entire wage in Bitcoin? Inflationary vs Deflationary Currency.,"I tried to imagine a world where Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) replaces fiat entirely.  For the purpose of this thought experiment, the cost and speed limit of transactions are ignored.

This means that everyone's salaries are paid in Bitcoin.

However, because Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, it would be very expensive for employers to offer annual raises.

Your wage might stay the same forever or even decrease over time.  But, your buying power would still increase.

I don't think the average person can wrap their head around that.  There would be no ""raise incentives"" at work which is the motivation for a lot of people to not slack off.",1518972543,18/02/2018 16:49:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yff4h/would_you_take_your_entire_wage_in_bitcoin/,1

"The future of Bitcoin - After 21mil, lightning network and quantum computing","I have been having some fun casually mining for a little while now, and have continued to do more reading and research into Bitcoin, and what its future may be. 

The more i read, the more exciting it sounds. Particularly, hearing about some of the history of BTC, and how passionate and invested some of you are, is amazing! However, there are still some things I don't understand.

Hence, I want to pose my questions to the community and start a discussion. It would be great to hear what everyone's thoughts are on the below;

1) What will happen to Bitcoin once it reaches 21mil coins released? Namely, how will it be profitable to still mine? I understand people used to say transaction fees, but with the lightning network, wouldn't this affect this dramatically?

2) With all the talk of regulation, and of course the banks wanting control, is there a way that govt or banks could eventually control or shut down cryptos?

3) Reading about the potential that quantum computing brings to the table, how will this affect cryptos, blockchain and ultimately mining in the future? I imagine it would make things much faster and even more secure. Not to mention, hopefully use less power (less of a question, and more wanting to hear thoughts)

4) How will BTC and other cryptos affect fiat currencies in the future? I imagine if the US economy collapses, we would see a huge shift into cryptos.

Any other comments and thoughts also welcome. Just keen to learn more :)

question about unfairly cheap tx,"So i sent about 20$ worth of BTC to a friends wallet with samourai yesterday since i wasn't able to pay for our pizza via bitpay with it because they apparently don't support their address format.

I paid 10 cents and it confirmed within like 10-20minutes. Im watching https://dedi.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#all and realise were at almost all time low tx fees.

While watching jochen hoenickes mempool website i realize i dont really understand it properly i think. 

No i didn't search the whole web for an answer yet though i did some research on my behalf but im still not entirely sure how TX fees were able to drop this fast.

also has it something to do with segwit?

DIY Hardware Wallet - Bootable USB with Electrum,"So here is my crack at creating a hardware bitcoin wallet that works on my mac from a bootable USB. I’ve done a couple test transactions and everything seems to be on the up and up. I am by no means a programmer, but found all of this to be relatively easy. I had this idea a couple weeks ago and these are the steps i took. I'm curious to hear what you guys think. You need an internet connection to download Electrum wallet, so i realize this isn’t 100% secure, but i still think it’s safer than keeping your BTC on an exchange and waaaaay cheaper than buying a trezor or ledger. 

If you attempt this and anything goes wrong, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE. USE/ATTEMPT AT YOUR OWN RISK. this is an experiment.

This will all be on Mac. I imagine the steps would be similar on Windows.

I used a 32gb SanDisk. In Disk Utility I formatted the drive to Mac OS Journaled Extended. 

Downloaded Etcher here:
https://etcher.io/

Etcher allows you to write images (your OS) onto a drive.

The OS I chose was Raspberry Pi Desktop. I tried multiple OS and ran into problems booting, but this hasn't given me any issues. you can download the torrent or iso here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/

Once you have Etcher and the image file, Open Etcher, select the image and disk and run it. Once it's done your Mac will say the drive is not readable. That's fine. Eject and restart your computer.

When the computer begins to boot and you hear the start up tone, hold down the 'alt/option' key. This will bring up your boot selection. Select EFI Boot and hit enter. You’re going to want to select ‘run with persistence’, meaning any documents or programs you save will be saved. You should see Raspberry Pi Desktop. Let it load and do it's thing. 

Once you’re at the desktop, you’re gonna want to do your updates.

Open terminal (top left, black square with ‘&gt;_’ )
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
Give it some time to do it’s thing. This can take a little bit, you’ll know it’s finished when it says ‘pi@raspberrypi’ again

Download Electrum Wallet

Open terminal

Install dependencies:
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pyqt5 python3-pip

Install Electrum:
sudo pip3 install https://download.electrum.org/3.0.6/Electrum-3.0.6.tar.gz

Once it’s done installing, open your programs (the raspberry in the top left hand corner) and select ‘Run’

Type ‘electrum’

From here set up your wallet, just follow the prompts, pick the kind of wallet you want, create your seed, write it on paper and keep it somewhere safe (if you need to recover your wallet, you’ll need your seed), you’ll need to confirm it. Create a password for your wallet and encrypt it.

You now have a Bitcoin Wallet operational on your bootable USB!

I didn’t do this, but it is possible to use this wallet offline. Watch this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQumISxkJsQ

Tips greatly appreciated

Entertain me for a second, if you don't believe in this technology then this thread is just not for you, you can talk about how BTC has failed as money and will always do so in every other thread like you already do.

It's somewhere between 2078 and 2128.. Using fiat is like riding a horse as an actual, unironic, means of transport. Let's not even think of the political structures or effects of climate change. There is a self-owning autonomous taxi service, trains are only seen in museums, everybody has solar roofs and most importantly of all, Elon Musk's grandchildren have increased the number of solar Gigafactories to 65. We are operating on the assumption that with increased energy usage extended by the increase over the following 100 years, it will actually take closer to 150-300 Gigafactories to power the world for free, but we are getting there.

What do you think happens to Proof-of-Work, mining and Proof-of-Stake by that time, and secondly, what would the future beyond us look like if our children and/or grandchildren would be able experience free energy in their lifetimes?",1519002820,19/02/2018 01:13:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yiyt7/thoughts_or_rather_questions_on_btccrypto_future/,1

Questions from a beginner...,"Posted in crypto, but it got covered up quickly so I thought I'd give it a shot here.

1 - I'm only using Binance for now, but assume there is a minimum buy limit on all exchanges? If so, any of the more reputable sites have a lower limit?

Curious as I bought like 22 of one coin, but wanted an even 30... just because. I can't do that however due to their limits unless I'm missing something.

2 - With the newer altcoins, I get why they aren't on major exchanges, and I noticed some developers talking about fees on those. That said, why in the world are some of these guys going with really poor choices?

I've seen some interesting options that people here and elsewhere have also liked, but they are all on sites that don't scream trust. Just curious if they don't know any better as their head is too involved on the technical side or what the deal is.

I'll probably take a shot on a few regardless. Don't see an issue if I'm ""in and out"" and don't keep my funds on the exchange for the most part.

3 - Are there any legitimate review sites?

Noticed in my research that plenty of those kept popping up. I also know that most have paid content from the industry and they hire writers to crank out a lot of what people are reading.

Finding good ones in any niche is tough, but figured there may be some neutral sites out there worth checking out.",1518995906,18/02/2018 23:18:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yi8q2/questions_from_a_beginner/,2

Using Bitcoin as interplanetary currency?,Would it be possible to use Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) as interplanetary currency? Imagine if mankind would colonize Mars. Wouldn't it be awesome to have a unified currency? I think the main problem would be the high latency between Earth and Mars between 13 and 24 minutes (for one way). And while Earth and Mars are on the opposide side of the Sun there is no connection at all. How could a single blockchain be used to recorde transactions from both planets in this scenario?,1518994110,18/02/2018 22:48:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yi1ri/using_bitcoin_as_interplanetary_currency/,69

The United States should invest in incorporating blockchain technology for future elections.,"The modern election system is broken. We have a number of Representatives, depending on the population count, who are supposed to represent their areas in a vote. That's absurd, we don't need someone to come in and essentially vote for a group of people. Blockchain technology would easily eliminate that need.

### SETUP :: THE VOTING MACHINES
Each polling machine is disconnected from everything, and sent to the voting node in each county as an encrypted vote on the blockchain.

### MINING :: COUNTING VOTES
Every county compares their local copy of the blockchain with one another. Any county that doesn't match up retries that block automatically. This would ideally take around 30 confirmations to trigger the next step.

Once every county is done and every vote matches across the board, the state will do the same thing. 

### THE AFTERMATH 
I don't expect this to be a quick process, so the results would likely wind up around the same time as inauguration. That would be a good way to grease a concession speech, I suppose.

We could kick Russian interference in future elections out the door just by bringing our most important decision every 4 years into the 21st century.

Hell, we could even go as far as offer small tax breaks/write-offs to people who are willing to contribute their processing power for the mining stage.",1518987247,18/02/2018 20:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yh98r/the_united_states_should_invest_in_incorporating/,0

What is the best response to the argument that Bitcoin isn't truly scarce?,"I’ve heard Peter Schiff argue that Bitcoin isn’t truly scarce because an infinite number of competing cryptocurrencies can be invented. But by that logic, gold isn’t truly scarce either because I can take a random piece of wood, spray paint it gold, and offer this “woodgold” as a competing commodity.

A goldbug might reply that this analogy is ridiculous because gold has properties (scarcity, historical value) that woodgold doesn’t. But that’s exactly the point. Bitcoin has properties that a random altcoin doesn’t; i.e., network security (people seriously underestimate how valuable it is that Bitcoin has survived nearly a decade of sophisticated and persistent attacks), the development community, first mover status, number of adopters, etc. Sure, anyone can create an infinite number of random altcoins, but good luck trying to get people to adopt it and to take the time to protect the integrity of the network.

What is your best response to the “bitcoin isn’t truly scarce” argument?

Frozen addresses and Bitcoin quantum proofing.,"We all know there are at the very least 1 Mln BTC in frozen accounts. Nobody has access to the private keys to move them.


In the foreseeable event of quantum computing, bitcoin would need to replace its current ECDSA based cryptography.


From what I understand, this would require all Bitcoin users to generate new, quantum-proof addresses and move all their funds from their old addresses to the newly generated ones.
But what about frozen/lost coins? Those would be out in the wild for anybody with enough computing power to crack and spend as they like.
This would of course threaten the long term value of BTC (we are talking about 1-3 Mln coins at least).


So what are we going to do about this? Here is the only solution I could come out:

a) Hard fork into a fully quantum-proof ""Bitcoin Quantum"": issue 21 Mln new bitcoin quantum (BTQ) and require all users to generate a BTQ address and sign a message with their old wallets containing the new BTQ address, distribute 1 BTQ for every old BTC owned. Then take all unclaimed BTQ and either send them to a burn address or proportionally distribute them among post-quantum holders.

b) Soft fork still requiring all users to move their funds to quantum-proof addresses, but this time we keep using the btc blockchain because nodes agree on a block # beyond witch they will reject any transaction coming from pre-quantum addresses, effectively burning away all unclaimed funds.

I'd like to know what you think in the comments.",1519045387,19/02/2018 13:03:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ymi0r/frozen_addresses_and_bitcoin_quantum_proofing/,2

Almost free buy and sell of btc if you're in uk,"OK so I been looking Into how to avoid fees for UK buyers. 

You can download an app called revolut.

Then you go

Pounds to revolut. 

Revolut sepa payment to coinbase, or straight to gdax. (thus avoiding the Coinbase card purchase fee). I can't remember if we went to Coinbase or gdax, but I should think you can go straight to gdax. 

If to Coinbase, transfer euro to gdax (free) 

Then buy in gdax at market rate or with limit order (thus avoiding the Coinbase 4% buy/sell fee)

Reverse process.

You'd normally loose 4% on buying from Coinbase plus the card purchase fee, then 4% on selling back to them. (or similar, basically you buy above the market rate and they buy back below the market rate).

If your bank doesn't charge you for sepa payment and you use this without revolut, you would save the card fee BUT have to pay the bank rate for converting your pounds to euros and then euro to pound for the sepa payments back and forth. Revolt minimises these.

I did a sepa from my bank to Coinbase and lost roughly 4% from the bank conversion from pounds to euro. 

We tested it out back and forth and lost about 18 pence on 10 gpb, end to end. ",1519046861,19/02/2018 13:27:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ymmu6/almost_free_buy_and_sell_of_btc_if_youre_in_uk/,17

At what point does your bank and BTC exchange ask you about the source of your funds?,"As a US citizen, say in the last year you sold over $100K of BTC through one exchange and transferred to one bank. Is there a threshold at which they will ask about source of funds? I ask not because I have anything to hide (I can explain what I can and am willing to) but I'm personally just waiting for this and it's been on my mind for months. Based on stories I read, mostly from people with negative experience with this event, people got asked when they dealt with much lower amounts (&lt;$50K) and use Coinbase or Circle. I use Gemini and I wonder if the reason I never get asked is because Gemini is the most compliant platform? I imagine my bank doesn't ask because Gemini complies with everything to make banks happy and Gemini doesn't ask because my funds are peanuts compared to some other traders on the auction block?",1519048838,19/02/2018 14:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ymtch/at_what_point_does_your_bank_and_btc_exchange_ask/,15

I found an article about a similar sounding scam targeting Australians a few months back. I'm based in Ireland and it came to my Irish phone number.

So I have decided to solve the issue myself. I am in the process of developing a site where people can go and search for sites/stores that accept crypto and refine search by coin/industry etc. The site will also give companies the capability of adding themselves for free if they accept crypto and provide a profile of who they are etc with a url attached.

What things or concepts who you like to be incorporated in the site? I want it to be as user friendly and helpful to the community as possible.

How can I fulfill my bitcoin dream?,"Hello Bitcoin Community,

at first, I'm not here to beg for bitcoin.

My story:
I am a bitcoin holder since 2016. I started to buy btc with 1/4-1/5 of my monthly income. In a short time I noticed, bitcoin will be the future of money and then I started to invest almost my whole income. Today I have about 8 bitcoins. I am a btc enthusiast and supporter. The biggest dream of my life is not a beautiful woman, fiat money, nice holiday or something like that. The biggest dream of my life is to own at least 10 bitcoins. If the price stay this year between 10-15 k $, I will have about 8,6-8,8 bitcoins at the end of 2018. I am really afraid that I will be not able to fulfill my bitcoin dream. My income is constant, but the price of bitcoin grows.

Do you have any ideas how can I make my dream come true? I sold all my bitcoin forks. I don't want to speculate on stock market, because I don't want to lost my bitcoins. I don't like banks and also I am afraid of bank credits. 

Any ideas? :/

Regards

Question about the blockchain,"Hi everyone,

I'm still learning how this stuff works and hoping someone can explain something in the blockchain to me. I apologize in advance if this thread violates any rules and will delete the post immediately.

I bought some Bitcoin in the Square Cash app today to transfer to my Binance account. I'm used to Coinbase usually doing the transfer pretty quickly, but that didn't happen with Cash so I checked my Binance address on blockchain.info.

I've done transactions between Cash and Binance before so I believe I may have found my Cash Bitcoin address through the transactions. But the transactions I made today are not appearing on either address, not even as pending.

So I'm curious, when should it show up as pending on blockchain, if not immediately after making the transfer?

**Edit**: So I think that the issue here lies in my bank account. I just checked and it says that the amounts are pending there. I don't think this is related to blockchain, Bitcoin, or the Cash app.

Still, I am curious how the blockchain works and curious about these transactions as I just want to learn more about how this whole system works.",1519068650,19/02/2018 19:30:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ypc7o/question_about_the_blockchain/,1

A quick recap of my/our experience being long-time HODLER(s) in 2018,"(beginning of January 2018)- Bitcoin just taking its correction all nice and easy for the first beginning of the month. Us hodlers are just chilling, life is good. Haters still be hating *no suprise*. 

(End of January 2018)- Were taking punches and threats, all my friends are sending me FUD articles trying to tell me I'm an idiot. My mind can't handle stupidity so I simply short answer/do not reply to them and stay off Reddit.

(Beginning of February 2018)- I'm literally getting ripped apart from everyone I know. ""Bitcoin will never recover""... ""WTF ARE YOU DOING!!! GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN"". I continue giving the simple response ""LOL I'm just going to buy more at this point"" and the hate just consistently flows in.

(February 16th-present)- Media, Friends, ENTIRE FUCKING WORLD: ""FUCK WHY DIDN'T I BUY AT 6K""... ""ITS TOO LATE NOW""...""WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN TO YOU?"".  

My/Bitcoin communities response: ""I mean we did tell you to buy many many times..."" ""Buying in *early* refers to right now and anytime that bitcoin has ever existed because your only going to buy in *late* when bitcoin reaches all limits and we are far from that point...""

Response from my local Member of Parliament regarding his stance on Bitcoin and the lack of advice available (UK),"""Thank you again for writing to me about the significantly growing market of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies. 

As you say, the ease at which Bitcoin can be used is staggering and i understand your concerns about engaging with it. The problem with having a worldwide Cryptocurrency is that it does not have any government or bank to regulate it - although for some people this is seen as a positive. All transactions are recorded on computers but there are no systems in place that take responsibility for ensuring Bitcoin is only used legally. The lack of a physical regulator for Bitcoin makes it a frighteningly useful method for money laundering and buying products on the dark web. People remain anonymous so it is difficult to see who is making payments. According to Europol £3-4 Billion of criminal money is being laundered in Europe Alone (someone watched BBC's doc the other day!). 

As I understand it, any profits and losses surrounding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrenies are subject to Capital Games Tax (CGT). Charges on profits and allowances on losses are looked at on a case by case basis with individual circumstances and the goods or services being purchased taken into account. For instance, if you are buying a small item it is unlikely that you will have to pay CGT, but if you were buying a house you are likely to be. This is not, however, comprehensive advice and I would recommend that you look at advice available online for further information on this. Please note that much of the advice online is not formal and may not always be accurate. 

The Government is currently negotiating amendments to the European Anti-Money Laundering Directive so that virtual currencies can be included in their risk checks. This will extend to terrorism financing, and will provide transparency in Bitcoin Exchanges. This could be a vital step to ensuring users are safe and secure when venturing into Bitcoin. I have tabled Parliamentary Questions regarding the process of these negotiations and whether the Government plans to produce advice for those who are interesting in using and working with it, although it is not normal practice for governments to give investment advice. I will let you know when I receive a response to these questions. Caution is still adviced but Bitcoin is something Parliament is taking increasingly seriously and I will look out for any developments on the Governments approach in this area. 

I hope you find this information helpful.""

This past summer I told my gf that I would put down one of my bitcoin to buy her engagement ring just lmk when she wants me to sell. Well this January we went shopping found something she loves and I sold 1 since the price was dropping.

It took about 3 weeks for the ring to be special ordered and during that time bitcoin dropped significantly, I went ahead and bought back in at $6k which was about half the price I had originally sold at so I was able to pick up an extra bitcoin. Now with this rebound I can sell the extra coin and the ring largely paid for itself.

Coinbase Question,"Hey guys,

I bought some bitcoin a few days ago from coinbase and it's still pending. I bought it at around $9,000. 

It's gone up in value, is the price I bought it at 'locked in' even though the transaction is pending?

As soon as the transaction goes through, I plan on transferring my coin to a more secure party. I'm finding coinbase to be an absolute headache. Would not recommend.

To clarify my question - is the bitcoin going to reflect the value I bought it at, or the value once the btc goes through?

I assume the former, but I just wanted to double check because I know coinbase had a less than stellar reputation.

It's also worth noting that I did not buy a lot, plan to hodl, and do more research before buying coin again.

Stolen Bitcoin from Bitcoin Core Wallet?,"I am a bit of a noob with Bitcoin and just dabble in it a little. I believe I run a Full Node Bitcoin Core client on a PC I have as it has a copy of the full 169GB blockchain stored locally which took forever to initially sync. I found today that I had a transaction from my Bitcoin Core wallet that I did not authorize. It happened today around 12:49pm Central Time. I have checked the machine that I have the wallet stored on and I can not see any intrusion nor any malware on the machine. It is a headless system that sits in my basement and no physical access to it.  I am guessing somehow someone has the Private Key to the wallet but there is only one copy I know of and I have it physically written down with no digital copy. I have the below transaction details if anyone wants to take a look and see if there is any hope of retrieving my little BTC that was stolen.

2/19/18 12:49 Confirmed (56 confirmations). Sent to (no label) 13PR7Csx13rmzCZ22xa39wBSHXvLbZJdWR -0.01222127

From this transaction it appears as far as I can tell to have originated from this PC, can anyone confirm thats what it looks like?  Somehow this transaction was injected into my wallet and was confirmed which I am not sure how that is possible having only a paper copy of the Private Key.

Why centralization matters,"Disclaimer: this is just a quickly written up collection of thoughts. Any feedback is most welcome.

# Why centralization matters

I've seen a lot of discussion on centralization regarding Bitcoin and other (crypto)currencies, and there seem to be a lot of misunderstandings floating around. So I've decided to write up a summary of in which ways centralization matters, and in which ways it doesn't.

## Centralization of work

In a free market, nobody about centralization of work directly. If some people set up a highly efficient centralized production (aided by economies of scale etc.) of some easily transported good or service, things are fine, no problem. Problems arise when monopolies or cartels form to push out competition with illegal tactics, or worse, the state backs such monopolies/cartels. Price gouging and other anti-consumer practices are to be expected. If some external hostile entity sabotages the production, this can also have a devastating effect. This is a general problem, not limited to currencies (see e.g. net neutrality).

## Centralization of funds

Correspondingly, in the broader economical picture, centralization of funds can affect a market (see e.g. price manipulation) and the ability of its actors to function within it. In the case of Bitcoin, capital investment required to start up a competing business comes into play somewhat in the economies of scale in mining, and it is especially relevant in the manufacture of mining hardware. On the other hand, for the basic functioning of a (crypto)currency, it does not come into play unless we are talking about a proof-of-stake system.

## Centralization of custody

In the world of fiat currency, most people are used to keeping theirs in a bank of some sort. In cryptocurrencies, many people keep theirs in a custodial wallet. Both of these types of centralized custodial services are trusted actors that have the ability, although somewhat limited by the threat of legal prosecution, to just take those funds for themselves. Worse, they are juicy targets for thieves, whether external or internal, and can face the threat of asset seizure by the state(s) in which they operate.

## Centralization of auditing

In fiat currencies, transaction auditing is completely opaque and happens out of the public view, done by those same trusted custodial actors (highly centralized). Special (state) auditors can sometimes be granted access to check whether things are on the up and up, but then you have to trust THOSE actors to be honest, and the global state of the system is entirely in question. This is quite bad, especially since I am *also* trusting my bank with holding my money. What if the bank has promised more money to all of its customers than it actually has (fractional reserve)? Worse, what if this was legal and the state auditors are fine with it happening?

In Bitcoin (and many other cryptocurrencies), the global state is transparent and can be audited by everyone who wants to, somewhat limited by the high burden of auditing every transaction in the entire history of the system (decentralization inversely related to scale). Ethereum, for example, is (nearly) impossible to fully audit without SSDs, as HDDs simply do not have the IOPS required to keep up with the pace of new transactions. This complete auditability also means that Bitcoin at the blockchain layer has very poor privacy.

In Lightning Network auditing of any specific transaction is done only by the parties involved in the transaction, and is - especially compared to Bitcoin - very scalable (very decentralized), with the added advantage that global auditing happens on the underlying cryptocurrency layer during the closing of the channel. After all, I don't care why Alice and Bob decided to close their channel with a certain split, as long as the total outputs don't exceed the inputs. Alice cares that Bob doesn't cheat her, and can verify that he doesn't. LN does not allow for fractional reserves.

## Centralization of processing

Banks already have custody of your money, but what if your entire bank is blocked by the rest of the system, or even just by the bank of the person you want to transact with? Your transactions are trivially censored, and it might not even have anything to do with you, what if you are just some random Latvian whose bank is accused of laundering North Korean money?

In the theoretical model of Bitcoin, miners are responsible for processing transactions into blocks. In the practical model, it is actually the mining *pools* that do this job, where the miners are simply crunching away at the hashes; centralization here is quite high. If a cartel of these pools controls the block creation for 51% or more of the global hashrate, this means it can selectively censor transactions, which means it can push out its competition, it can hold payments hostage and, due to the stricter security model of LN, could potentially even steal funds.

In Lightning Network, a transaction from Alice through Bob through Carol to Dave, looks the exact same to Carol as a transaction from Bob through Carol through Dave to Alice.

CEX.IO is totally SCAM or unorganized? Any help?,"(request #651767)
I have had  really really hard time to get answer from CEX.IO that they would refund my money. 
(you can't even imagine. It has been nearly a month.)
They said they sent my money back not providing ANY KIND OF PROOF(receipt, MT-103, etc.)

Feb 16, CEX.IO said ""Your funds should have reach your bank account.""

### But Even now(Feb 20), I don't get any money(USD 5500)!!! ###

I visited my bank many many times, but I can't learn any further 
because all of information they provided is that ""they sent money."" and they refuse to provide the information.(by ignoring my e-mail)

Is it true that CEX.IO wired money?? or they are just lying?
They ignored my e-mail asking bank information.

I take this issue very seriously, and I am outraged by it.

My bank(WOORI BANK, SWIFT : HVBKKRSEXXX) confirmed that there's no fund arrived.  (Feb 20, 04:46 GMT)
And they ask the bank information(MT-103) to investigate.

Please, take appropriate action right now.
First is send me all of bank information(MT-103).

I can't believe this kind of unorganized(or SCAM) accident happening in ENGLAND.

"When will Bitcoin become a reliable ""currency"" people can transfer money to?","Bitcoin used to be reliable and consistent. If anything, it would go up but you never feared for losing your money by transferring money into a wallet to use it as a means of purchases. Now, you can't even help but wonder if your $100 is going to turn into $50 before you even get the transactions cleared. 

I like putting extra money in accounts so I don't have to keep doing transfers but this is just ridiculously unreliable as any sort of ""future"" of digital payments.  I'm just going to lose half my money because some rich guys decided Bitcoin is risky this month so they pull out their millions? People think this will replace the banking system? So we all just live our lives with our future on the line and every day wake up to see if half our net worth crashes while we were sleeping?

I know there are lots of debates going on right now regarding ""which is better"" and all that bs but the truth is none of them are even stable enough to put any kind of money in you aren't willing to throw away. It's an exciting investment roller coaster for the rich but their thrills are essentially destabilizing crypto as being a practical form of currency for people.

Will it ever be reliable?

With lightning network can off-chain transactions be done without internet?,"Please correct me if i am wrong, A lightning network allows you to create a channel between peers and enables transactions among them as long as the channel remains open. So does this mean to open a channel internet is no longer required? eg:can it be a local network or Bluetooth or a wifi hotspot ?

I am thinking, in scenarios where internet is temporarily disrupted eg : natural calamities, government shutdown, one could technically be able to transact bitcoin without the need to internet(at least temporarily) . would this work?

Which are your favorite sites for comparing bitcoin's position &amp; statistics relative to other crypto coins?,"I've been investing part of my salary in bitcoin since April 2017. However some family members have sadly failed to understand how only bitcoin keeps its value through the long-term.

Unfortunately both my brothers and uncle made some really misguided investment decisions, and lost money by investing in alternative cryptocurrencies (notably with bit-conect).

I'd like to show them how bitcoin performs relative to all cryptocurrencies. My main goal is to provide them with trusted price comparison tools for analyzing bitcoin's stats versus other cryptos. Thus they can learn how these markets work &amp; make their own informed analysis and conclusions. However, I'd like to make sure i'm recommending tools that do not put forward schemes like bit-conect.

So which are your favorite sites to compare crypto prices relative to bitcoin position and long-term dominance?

How Bitcoin will save millions of lives,"In the 20th century alone, national governments have killed more than 160 million of their own citizens. The most notorious examples are the USSR, PRC and Nazi Germany. 

And it's not a thing of the past: large-scale democides are still happening. The most recent ones are the Srebrenica massacre (1995) and the Darfur genocide (ongoing). 

The only way to prevent democides is to shift the balance of power from the State to the Citizen, to empower the Individual over the Majority. 

There are several technologies that could help, including:

* **3d-printed assault rifles**: it's significantly harder to send someone to a concentration camp if he's a part of a well organized and well armed militia
* **home power stations** (solar etc), automatic farming, hydroponics: the Gov will not be able to create an artificial famine (like the Holodomor) if citizens can grow enough of their own food
* **mesh networks**, TOR, other tools to make the Internet more censorship-resistant: to support the armed resistance, among other things
* **seasteading**: to reduce the physical and legal reach of the Gov
* **Bitcoin**: to make the governmental economic warfare less effective; to avoid supporting the totalitarian Gov with your taxes; to mitigate the mass extortion of wealth à la India, Zimbabwe, Venezuela

None of these technologies are bullet-proof solutions against tyranny. But if we combine them, we can at least reduce the number of victims of the next large-scale democide. 

Bitcoin will change the world in many ways, but this is probably the most important one: Bitcoin will save millions of lives.",1519126367,20/02/2018 11:32:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yv85u/how_bitcoin_will_save_millions_of_lives/,3

"PSA: Bitcoin is not your pet solution to problem ""X"". It is one thing: better money.","It's not anti-government.

It's not anti-rich.

I keep seeing people's individual world goals and causes getting mangled in with their love for Bitcoin. Some seem to think that Bitcoin will be the great economic equalizer. As though the rich won't be able to horde it, invest it, grow wealthier year after year, and influence the governments of the world to pass business-friendly legislation, while the poor remain powerless.

Bitcoin is better money because it can't be confiscated, controlled, created, or counterfeited. This in turn prevents governments from abusing an endless supply of cheap cash. But gold coins would also fix 99% of these problems.

The future may bring block-chain technologies to other areas of our society that are in desperate need of overhaul (i.e. police, taxing, voting...). But those things are outside the scope of what Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is better money.

My family online jewelry shop is now accepting Bitcoin!,"Hello guys,

My family owns a jewellery shop that makes traditional handmade silver jewellery at low prices. I recently started helping them by making an online shop for our products:

www.lefkarasilver.com

Me and my family are very proud believers of the cryptocurrency revolution, and the best way to prove that is by accepting cryptocurrencies for our jewellery!

We are very proud to announce that our online jewellery shop is among the first (if not the first) who accepts 4 major cryptos!! -  **Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH),  &amp; Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**

You can buy all our jewellery by paying in crypto their USD equivalent using the latest cryptocurrency/fiat rates as provided by Coinbase.

The purchase of our jewellery with cryptocurrencies is fast, reliable and accurate and the fees are minimal! if you wish to see a tutorial how to do the cryptocurrency order please see this video that I have just prepared:

https://youtu.be/HlrJ36sDdlA 

The process to fulfill the payment takes 3-7 minutes with LTC as seen on the video! VERY fast and that is a great proof that cryptocurrency can truly be used for means of payment online!!!

*We will really appreciate your support in our efforts!* Even if you can’t afford to buy anything, maybe follow our social media or share our post?

A very big thanks to all of you, from our little island in Europe, Cyprus!!
~George

Bitcoin Price Holds its Own in Spite of Virtual Crime Wave,[deleted],1519137223,20/02/2018 14:33:43,https://cryptonewsmagnet.com/bitcoin-price-holds-spite-virtual-crime-wave/,1
"If BTC is to become THE currency, are there enough?","Hi everyone,

while I'm a huge supporter of BTC I was was wondering about the following ""issue"":

If BTC is to become the world currency, I would say there are not enough (nor will there ever be).

Let's take the following example and assume that the cheapest item that can be bought at a price of 0.1 USD cent:

1 BTC = 100.000.000 Satoshis

if 1 Satoshi = 0.1 USD cent then 1 BTC = 10.000.000 USD cent

which equals 1 BTC = 100.000 USD

There will roughly be 20.000.000 BTC in existence by 2040 (slightly accounting for lost BTC etc.), still crude number

That would mean that all BTCs would be worth about 2.000.000.000.000 USD

But here's my issue: The total money in existence right now is worth about (and that's as crude as the previous number) 1.000.000.000.000.000 USD (that's 3 zeros more than above). Meaning that all of the BTC at a price of 100.000 USD would only make up for about 0,002% of that.

Now as BTC is not divisible to more than 8 decimal places I can see an issue that even with only one Satoshi, one would overpay for certain items. I know this is all hypothetical especially considering the assumed moon price of 100k per coin, but what I'm really interested in is the following:

Is there a strategy to tackle this potential issue from BTC's side?
Will there be another option via something like atomic swaps? For example everybody has a stash of BTC, but would really pay with an altcoin that in itself is worth a fraction of BTC.
Looking forward to any feedback to this!

Setting up a Bitcoin Lightning Node,"Hey guys,  
So while I get that it's risky af, the idea of being an early adapter of Bitcoin Lightning is extremely alluring to me.  
I found a guide for setting up a node [here](https://medium.com/@dougvk/run-your-own-mainnet-lightning-node-2d2eab628a8b) but I'm having a surprisingly difficult time trying to figure out how to monetize it, or what that would look like.  
Since my node would be processing transactions, would the fees for each transaction just start accumulating in my wallet?  
To be frank, I'm starting at -0% in regards to tech knowledge in building this, but I do believe in the technology and am willing to invest in learning so that I can do this.  
So with that said, can anyone confirm if what I'm thinking is right, and if so, does anyone have any idea of what type of money can be made by running a node on Lightning Network?  
Thanks!",1519137628,20/02/2018 14:40:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ywc0d/setting_up_a_bitcoin_lightning_node/,21

Feel like I need a quick vent,"The other day I sold some BTC (day before the pump of course) and I attempted to do Coinbase and for some reason we couldn't get my bank hooked up so I used localbitcoins.com and I think due strictly to that fact that I was trying to rush everything, I OK'd a trade with a user who use a check and now I'm out $600 to chase and I have no choice but to sell about 25% of my portfolio to cover the bank debt I've accumulated due to my negligence. It's almost funny because I'm the guy who's always mentioning to my friends about the mistakes I've made and not to make those same mistakes, wether it was not HODL a coin (had 100+K verge and sold before .27 pump) mainly sold that verge because I lost 30K in the coinpouch hack. It's like I can't seem to find a win in crypto. No matter how hard I shill it to everyone I know I just seem to mess everything up, firsthand. I mean, I guess I now have another story and reason to talk to newcomers about the importance of how you transfer your coin.

Bitcoin’s transaction fee crisis is over—for now,"According to ArsTechnica, The median fee peaked at $34 in mid-December—now it's less than $1.

One Reason for the drop in fees is to a large extent, high fees became a problem that solved itself. As fees soared, some users looked for ways to use the network more efficiently, while others stopped using the network altogether.

At the same time, bitcoin's speculative bubble has been cooling in recent weeks, and that has likely pushed fees down as well. In December, money was pouring into the bitcoin market, and people were willing to pay top dollar to get their bitcoins into exchanges to sell them at high prices. But bitcoin's price has fallen dramatically since the December peak of $19,500. It reached a low of $6,000 earlier this month, and by Monday afternoon one bitcoin was worth around $11,000. A cooling market naturally means less demand to move bitcoins around for speculative purposes.

IDEA: Decentralized and gamified Bitcoin lottery.,"This idea centers on a videogame grinding challenge that would need to be achieved to gain 1 Bitcoin. Only the first winner each time gets it; there could be prizes for the top 10, as well. There would be a new videogame grind every time a winner was found as long as there are funds.

THE TWIST: The videogame doubles as a miner (not necessarily of Bitcoin); that is, THE LOTTERY PRIZE WOULD BE MINED BY THE PLAYERS AS THEY PLAY. The developer would profit by selling the videogame for $2. The players would profit by potentially winning the ""lottery"" by achieving a top 10 score.

It's a combination of fun and greed.",1519145897,20/02/2018 16:58:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yxfe2/idea_decentralized_and_gamified_bitcoin_lottery/,3

Will the blocks stay at 1MB in Cores Road Map?,"If yes, how high has it been calculated that an on chain fee would need to be to support mining once the reward is finished?

If the blocksize will raise how much would the optimal fee be on chain given the trade off between an on chain fee vs mining centralization?

Edit: It would surely be easier to maintain  mining profitability with a higher transaction throughput, otherwise would the transaction volume on chain be extremely sensitive to small fluctuations? I.E if 20,000 on chain transactions with 1MB blocks was the optimal fee level for use of the blockchain + mining reward then if it dropped by only 10k it could be a disaster. Vs if the blocks were bigger and it would take 50,000 on chain transactions for optimal fee level if it dropped by 10k transactions per block it wouldn't pose such an issue?

"But, what's it backed by?","Perhaps I have done too much bitcoin reading in the last weeks, as I feel a strong need to confront a massive misunderstanding about bitcoin's value being based off of nothing.  You hear it from banking and government officials, you hear it from gold bugs (extra frustrating because I am a bit of a gold bug), and you hear it from the financial talking heads.  I used to love Peter Schiff a decade ago, now I want to throw something at him.

The statement (often phrased as a question to give the appearance of fairness from a talking head): Bitcoin has no value because it is not backed by anything.

I find this statement to be so mindbogglingly idiotic that it makes me instantly lose respect for the person making it.  And every last one of these people are using money not backed by anything.  OK they do have one thing backing it, but telling me my dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the us gov is effectively the same as saying my dollar is redeemable in AAA rated bull$&amp;#@.  I digress, back to the point.

So what is bitcoin backed by?

Bitcoin is backed by almost a decade of work from 100s of developers that were so passionate about this project they gave their time freely (even though it had significant value).

Bitcoin is backed by the work done (and still being done) by the most powerful computing network that ever existed.

Bitcoin is backed by the oldest block chain ledger that has been made cryptographic-ally secure by that same computing network.

To imply that bitcoin is not backed by anything of value is to imply that high quality ideas, mental labor, and voluntary participation have no value.  

I'm longing for the day when I start hearing really witty retorts to these chowder heads.

""Thanks for informing me Ms. Talking Head, I had no idea a computer network more powerful than Google's was worthless""

""Sorry Mr. Schiff, I won't use goldmoney because that is a website and since hours spent programming are worthless, goldmoney's site must be worthless too""

Like I said, I did too much reading the last week and just needed to get that off my chest somewhere it might be appreciated;)

Shift Card is Shifty,"This is just a brief PSA for those who have, or are considering getting, the Shift card from Coinbase. It's a great convenience, but it does come with a caveat or two and I just ran into one. Fraud resolution.

If you get a fraudulent charge pending on your account, Coinbase/Shift will not reverse it immediately. Instead, you have to wait 30 days for it to close, at which point the charge can/will be disputed. Presumably you'll get a credit at some future date after that. They claim that this is standard policy for Visa/Mastercard accounts, i.e.; what you'd expect from your bank. This is, of course, categorically untrue.

To be fair here, I'm sure this is in the terms and conditions for the card, so I'm not suggesting anything untoward as far as that goes. But I was expecting behavior similar to other bank accounts and credit cards, all of which have, in cases of fraud, reversed charges immediately and handled whatever they need to on the backend.

Also, when you close your account and get a new card issued, they charge you a $10 card re-issuance fee. Lovely. 

Summarizing, then: fraud is on you financially (since the money is locked up) for at least 30 days, closing your account and getting a new card due to fraud is also on you financially.

I'll again say that this is likely all in the terms and conditions, and it's my bad that I didn't read them carefully enough. That said, I think it's fairly bad/shady business practice, or at least very customer unfriendly. I like the convenience of the card, but if this happens again, or this current situation doesn't get resolved satisfactorily, I will be cancelling my card account.

As an aside also, I have most of my BTC and other currency in hardware wallets offline, and only keep enough in my Coinbase/Shift account for this purpose. Had I had a lot of money in my account, someone could have fraudulently locked up the entirety of my holdings and Coinbase/Shift would have done nothing to resolve the issue. Something to think about.",1519158217,20/02/2018 20:23:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yz5lz/shift_card_is_shifty/,2

"When people ask why Bitcoin or crypto in general has value, what do you say? Trying to establish a template reply","I see this asked all the time and when I actually try to answer it, I sort of have to rack my brain and realize I do not fully understand the system myself. Someone asked this recently and this is my reply, maybe some of you can help add to it and correct what I got wrong. I want to give people the least technical explanation as possible

Someone asked why they can't just start their own coin called CCoin and why it can't catch up to the same value as BTC, like what makes BTC so special or unique if they can just copy the code and launch their own altcoin, this is my reply to them - 

""That is the point of a cryptocurrency, it is a trustless, decentralized ledger that anyone can use. Peer to peer, borderless, trustless and secured by the most advanced cryptographic encryption known to mankind at the moment. Your money in a bank is not really backed by anything either, it is value on a central ledger depending on which bank you have it in. Instead of keeping this value in the hands of 1 company, every single peer and computer that connects to the Bitcoin network aka Blockchain has this same copy on their computer as well. When a change happens, it happens on every single persons computer. In order for this to work, you have to solve one of the biggest problems in financial and banking history - the double spend dilema. 2 people withdrawing money from 1 account at the same exact time. A central authority or bank will prevent this from happening because of the nature of the closed system.

What is amazing about bitcoin/blockchain is that it solves this same double spend problem through the use of the peer to peer distributed ledger. Mining code and hardware scans every input and output across every single node/computer and through very advanced math and cryptography, blocks that attempt to double spend will not be accepted into the general ledger everyone sees and they will be orphaned blocks that never make it to the actual blockchain and thus making those attempted double spend transactions dead on the spot and abanonded.

This whole system is run by people using mining software and hardware. In order to verify every block you need to run code and this way the blockchain is secured literally every millisecond and has 10 years of transaction history that cannot be altered, hacked, adjusted, manipulated, etc.

In order for people to be willing to run this software and hardware running these computations there has to be a financial incentive. Bitcoin IS the financial incentive/reward for spending time and money running the hardware to do these millisecond to millisecond block verifications. Once a transaction is entered into the history, it continues to be validated for its lifetime in the blockchain. 

This becomes very intricate and demand more and more computing power. As more and more people start mining, the difficulty of verifying a block increases and adjusts the reward of bitcoin as well. This is all prebuilt into the system itself and it is completely open source. If you want to see how it works and how it adjusts reward based on number of miners and their computing power (hashrate) please read the bitcoin whitepaper here https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

It is completely open source and therefore developers all over the world can verify there are no backdoors or any sneaky code that can ever be altered or manipulated at a future date. It is basically set in stone. THe reason if you started your own coin AKA CCoin it would not have value because it does not have the legacy, time, transaction history and insane network of computers that have been working together and growing in hardware power in 2009. 

This system is very complicated and simple at the same time and I wish I could explain it better, but just trust the fact that it has been operating with no issue, hacks, stolen or manipulated ledger values (bitcoins) ever since its inception in 2008. The code and system is ROCK SOLID and the result of 1,000s if not millions of people working together without any central authority, figurehead, exact plan or schedule. The computing network alone that is currently mining and verifying bitcoin is larger and worth more in hardware dollars alone than all of google, microsoft, apple, whoever else servers/computing power COMBINED.

That is why Bitcoin has value, is a revolutionary tech, and will create trusteless, secure, immutable peer to peer systems not just for money but all financial accountability, government accountability, voting, etc. 

Please take the time to further educate yourself and don't listen to these old banksters and financial experts. They are like the horse and buggy crowd that said people will never drive cars, they are noisy, loud , can kill people and the entire country is never going to build enough roads to support an automobile infrastructure.""",1519158764,20/02/2018 20:32:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yz8in/when_people_ask_why_bitcoin_or_crypto_in_general/,2

"My doctor is into bitcoin and crypto, just had the coolest talk earlier this day","Today in the morning I went to my doctor in order to get a confirmation that I'm sick (nothing serious). 

However I told him that I need it to push a deadline for a project at uni, he wanted to know what it is about, me: ""blockchainbased unisystem"". 

That made his eyes shine, and he asked me tons of questions, and we spent like 25 minutes to chat about crypto. 

He asked me what I'm invested in, told me what he did, I told him about mtgox and how I got fked by it and so on. 

He even knew the great coin of carlos and the fiasco around it.

He also told about a few nice usecases for the medical branche and about how great the blockchain is, and how shady banks are.

Why did this blow my mind so much? His ordination was filled with patients and yet he didn't care.

I reached out to all the restaurants in my area accepting crypto according to coinmap.com; none of them accept crypto anymore.,"Hey there. So I have been in this entire crypto thing since late 2014, early 2015. Back then I was a minor, so I did not get to buy crypto, so I could not get rich. I also could not go out and spend it somewhere, even tough in my local city about nine restaurants and cafés accepted crypto (mostly BTC but also LTC). Today, I have some left over cash sitting in an exodus wallet on my computer and a mobile wallet ready to go. So I went on coinmap.org and checked. Still there, nothing changed. That's odd, I thought, and wrote a short E-Mail to all of them.

None of them still accept any form of crypto. Most said nothing, those who did give a reason said the public interest just wasn't there.

My question to you guys: How did this happen?

How can I as an individual change that, so I can buy a coffee or a sandwich from a local shop with the money of the future-and-kind-of-right-now?

Is there a well-known alternative to coinmap I don't know about and where all the new buissinesses are?

Thanks in advance!

Founding Fathers of Bitcoin,"I'm working on a ""project"" and need help identifying people who might be considered the ""Founding Fathers of Bitcoin"" (or Mothers)

I'm not sure yet how to define founding fathers but it has to include people instrumental to the creation and development of Bitcoin. Based on my research, here are some names I've come up with. I have more on ""a list"" but, after talking to a few bitcoin enthusiasts, here's my starter list...

* Satoshi Nakamoto
* Nick Szabo
* Adam Back
* Eric Hughes
* Wei Dai
* Tim May
* Hal Finney

If you believe someone belongs on a list like this, an explanation as to why will be helpful (any specific contributions, etc). Thanks.",1519162943,20/02/2018 21:42:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yzu15/founding_fathers_of_bitcoin/,12

Now some bitcoin is locked up with no way to recover without this yubikey.

IN A VERY BADD SITUATION WITH 2FA,"So.. I had all of my cryptoexchanges accounts secured using Google Authenticator.
However, my phone screen cracked, some water got into it and although I could hear the phone power on and any calls, the screen did not turn on.
NOW THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM, my 2FA was all there. I had 3 exchanges there. 1 of the exchanges, the back up code does not work -_-(hitbtc) , another exchange I wrote the backup code but I have zero clue where I wrote it. The last exchange I have it backed up so no issues there.
THE PROBLEM IS THE 2 EXCHANGES WHICH I DONT HAVE BACKED UP. I literally have no way to access them without having my phone.
Thinking that I could get the screen repaired and use my phone again, I sent it for a screen repair.
HOWEVER , after 5 WEEKS the repair guy told me that he could not fix the phone. Im not sure why, he couldn't tell me whats wrong and I don't really believe him since he took 5 weeks in the first place.
Now im super scared because if my phone doesnt work I dont think its possible to access the exchanges.
I know you guys will recommend contacting the support but I dont have any transaction hashes or any of the info, (although I do know how many coins I am holding, I do use the same Ip address for my transfers and I do have emails confirming deposits/withdrawals). So I am scared that support might not be able to help me.
So what I'm thinking is to send the phone to a more expensive repair shop to get it repaired there.
But if they cant fix it... is there any way for me to get access to accounts, like can I move my authenticator from the broken phone to a new phone??????? I really need acess to these accounts and Im very scared of my situation",1519170404,20/02/2018 23:46:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z0t9q/in_a_very_badd_situation_with_2fa/,0

"$1,000,000 USD per Bitcoin","The likelihood that Bitcoin is succeed as a currency relies on that fact that no one person (whale) can easily manipulate the price.

For this to happen the market cap and liquidity must increase 100x from here.

Bitcoin must have a market cap of $20 trillion USD for it to succeed as a currency, that's 100x increase from today's prices.  And roughly $800 billion USD traded daily.

Otherwise, we'll keep seeing whale manipulation and panics in the price.

Will the block size have to be increased in order for LN to work properly?,"The more I think about Lightning Network, the more critical I am about its future. 

Once Bitcoin blocks become full and transaction fees are through the roof, how will the LN on-board new users? 

If it is required to make at least one on chain transaction to open a payment channel on the LN and Bitcoin fees are say $100, wouldn't this reduce user adoption? 

The way I see it is that in the future when the blocks are full, we will have to hard fork to increase the block size in order to get more users using the LN and BTC. 

Is my thinking correct?

Avalon 821 raspberry pi controller issues,"My first miner came yesterday and I've been trying to figure out everything as I go, but I cannot seem to figure out why my avalonminer controller has locked me out of the luCI web interface. 

When I received and started setting up the avalonminer controller I did everything the way their website said- hooked it up to my router via ethernet cable and synced the ip addresses. I was able to get to their default ip login page of 192.168.0.100 and login for the first time without a password. This was my first time ever seeing this interface. The first thing I did naturally was setup a password. So far so good, rebooted the controller, and sure enough the Avalon login page required me to put in my new password. 

Next I wanted to change the network configuration of the controller to DHCP and I think I messed up here. In the web interface I enabled 'wireless' in the Network Settings, scanned for and connected to my wireless internet, then changed the drop down menu from 'static ip' to 'DHCP'. Then I changed my computer's ip back to 'obtain an ip address automatically', and rebooted the controller to make the changes take effect.

Now I cannot connect to the Avalon login page no matter what ip address I use. I always get a 'refused to connect' or 'connection timed out' error message. I'm worried I've eternally screwed myself because I can see the device connected when I login to my router's ip address web page. However I can't connect to the Avalon controller webUI. 

Also, a couple times I tried to log back in to the Avalon webUI I was able to get to a site that was completely blank except for ""luci seems to be corrupt, unable to find section 'main'"". What is this?

Am I missing something obvious or is there a technical solution to this problem? If its possible I would like to revert to the default settings of the Avalon controller and just ethernet it to my laptop, which is what I should have done from the beginning. Any help would be greatly appreciated... Do I need to order a whole new Avalon controller?",1519177635,21/02/2018 01:47:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z1oww/avalon_821_raspberry_pi_controller_issues/,0

Hashing algorithms in silicon: quality?,"Lets say Im a mid-senior manager at one of the worlds largest IC manufacturers. Lets also say that Im interested in devoting a little of my teams time to thinking about SHA256 hashing.

What Im interested in is if anyone here has any idea what the state of the art is in terms of implementation quality in silicon. Everyone always talks about the feature size on die of the various ASIC manufacturers but thats only a part of the story. One manufacturer could make a 22nm wafer that blows the competitions 16nm out of the water - both in hash rate *and* power usage per hash - if their algorithm implementation is better.

So my question is really if theres any data out there about the quality that the various existing ASIC implementations have and where their bottlenecks might be (whether on silicon or in the completed system). Id expect someone to have done a teardown/reverse engineer of the major suppliers systems out there by now. If not, maybe thats something my team could do too but I havent quite got the 'go' from upstairs on any of this so this is still just me thinking out loud in public for the moment.

"Goodbye HODLing, Hello ‘Spend and Replace’","We made it through quite possibly the worst fee challenge Bitcoin will ever face. Us graybeards remember picturing that as the greatest problem in the world to have, and we reached new highs along with it.

The worst part about the fee issue wasn’t not being able to use bitcoin day-to-day, we’re still not there yet, but that it made sense to pause on spreading it as many of us had grown accustom.

“Can I pay you in Bitcoin?” and “Can you pay me in Bitcoin” should be the first question we ask at the first onset of every transaction. This is how we expand the network. Only a real world offer will make Bitcoin real as money to some people, this is how we open minds, by putting money on the table.

Many of us came to Bitcoin in the old days thanks to the benevolent governments in our world banning certain forms of recreation. It’s utility became obvious. We needed this kind of money to do something we wanted to do, easily and without financial censorship. Let’s not forget that in the midst of appreciation/depreciation relative to legacy currencies.

One of the old excuses is that, if I convert all my spending fiat to Bitcoin, I may not be able to replace the Bitcoin for a few weeks until I get new fiat…

* It goes up more than it goes down so you’ll probably profit by virtue of it not being fiat in the first place.
* If you’re worried about losing value over that time, you can buy an equivalent short position to what you would keep in fiat on Bitmex, you’ll break even.

I know exactly what amount of fiat dollars I need on a regular basis, everything else becomes crypto. Everyone I do business with gets a crypto settled offer. If I need to hold fiat, I short that amount of bitcoin so that the worst I can do is break even by holding it. I do the opposite if I have to spend bitcoin I can’t replace, I take out a long position on Bitmex in that amount so that I don’t lose by not hodling.

It is incumbent in all of us to make Bitcoin a utility to others as we know its power. These short and long tools let us live up to the savvy financial decision that going crypto is. Fiat is legacy, and it isn’t hard to limit yourself to a few dozen fiat transactions a year.

I hope you've appreciated this insight and will visit my blog at capitalistdog dot com, use the shill links, and sub.",1519192465,21/02/2018 05:54:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z3bix/goodbye_hodling_hello_spend_and_replace/,157

What would you recommend me to do with 0.007715 BTC I have just earned through referrals? I need good business advice.,"I am playing a game in which you can deposit Bitcoin to buy game characters. This game happens to have a referral program as well. So I have actually referred some people and one of my referrals deposited some bitcoin and I received 35% commissions on his deposit. I was able to withdraw the bitcoin to my wallet which is exciting.

I received 0.007715 BTC without investing any money of my own. As of writing this 1 BTC is worth $11,041 on Bitfinex, so my hodlings are worth about $85 at this moment.

Apart from continuing to promote this game what do you think I should use the money for? How could I use this money wisely to earn even more?

**I mean I need sound investment advice. I don't want to just spend this money.**

What do you think I should do? This is my first money earned through referral marketing and I would surely like to continue in this direction.

I just want to know what my options are. I will consider more affiliate/referral marketing opportunities.

**Which ones are the best to promote???**

If you are an affiliate marketer or know something about online business and cryptocurrencies, I would like your advice on what to do next.

Thank you!",1519198234,21/02/2018 07:30:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z3u0z/what_would_you_recommend_me_to_do_with_0007715/,1

Bitcoin to Charity,"Hi guys, I'm new around here so please don't shoot me down right away.  I've recently become interested in Bitcoin and the wider Blockchain world.  Today Facebook reminded me that 2 years ago I released a song about my wee mama in aid of Alzheimer Scotland.  I started to think that if I had known more about Bitcoin at that time I would have tried to use it to encourage people to buy my song and raise more money for the charity.  Then I started to think that surely Bitcoin is the ultimate way for fundraisers and charities to be open and transparent and such like?  Anyway, I don't know how many charities allow bitcoin donations but if anyone wants to listen to the song they can here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw6TXjM1Aac and if it makes them want to donate, then find an Alzheimer charity that accepts Bitcoin!

We build digital startups and are now accepting bitcoin!,"We are [QwertyBit](https://qwertybit.com), a bespoke software development business, and have recently started accepting cryptocurrency payments for our services because of their fast confirmation times. Some banks are not transferring money during the weekends and we were struck waiting more than 4 days in the past for a simple payment, and bitcoin solves these issues. We are B2B and offer no microtransactions, so cryptocurrency transaction fees are not an issue. 

This subreddit is the main inspiration which led us to first giving bitcoin a try, which made us realize it's something we wanted integrated into our business. While most of our cryptocurrency payments have been done in Bitcoin so far, we currently accept other digital coins as well.

We strongly believe that cryptocurrency offers huge advantages which many other businesses should take into consideration.

Thank you all for representing a big step for us.

Seed question,"Ok...so I've been reading about mnemonic seeds...

The number of combinations for even a 12 word seed from a 2048 word list is utterly massive.

Therefore running through, bruteforcing and checking each seed would take a phenomenally huge amount of time.

However...

I can't find any information on how to determine the distribution of combinations.

Therefore, I'm struggling to determine the actual probability of getting lucky with a bruteforce attempt.

Has anyone had a crack at working this out?

I'm basically trying to work out if there is a minimal viable number of seed words to use as a backup. Of course, more is better but where does more start becoming pointless?",1519213862,21/02/2018 11:51:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z4zfe/seed_question/,2

About crushing the electrical energy price soon. #Bitcoin.,"Hi.

I am an Asian kid from the future, here to say to you how much you are stupid and funny.

Physics in your times is a bubble, a house of cards.
One day (spoiler: until 2020) the world will know the biggest ever discoveries in physics.

These will make it clear to you that right from Isaac Newton's discoveries the physics had been going a wrong way.
Basic errors in science occurred because (it’s really funny) people had not fully understood all the three Newton’s discoveries: Newton’s 1st, 2nd and 3rd Laws.

How on earth you all could do it? Hahaha.

It will become obvious to everyone that your scientific authorities are mentally blind and even not able to understand obvious things.

You, for the first time, will learn what is energy indeed (your current concept of energy is totally wrong) and will find a really inexhaustible source of clean energy.

There will also be built the multiplier of electrical energy.

From that moment the сivilization's progress will go up at an unprecedentedly big pace. 

What then happened with the Bitcoin price? What do you think?

After all the most funny thing about this was that after these discoveries got commonly known everybody in the world had only had one question, Why could no one guess it earlier? It was so because the discoveries were really simple and obvious. Even any child could make them.

Is there a place where I can find a collection of Bitcoin papers up to present?,"I'm playing catch up. I want to have a good understanding of the fundamentals and theoretical aspects before I dive into development. Just finished reading ""Bitcoin and Cryptocurrenty Technologies"" and the related Princeton Lectures on YouTube. 

I also read through Mastering Bitcoin, but not doing any of the coding in the book.

I read ""The Book of Satoshi"", which is a collection of forum posts and correspondence from Satoshi (which made me realize he's just a person who made mistakes just like the rest of us; not some diety that /r/btc makes him out to be)

Also read various various generic blockchain books and both of Andreas' Internet of Money books. 

I think I've read all the books I can without seeing significant overlap, so wouldn't mind reading some of the original papers that are mentioned in passing in these books.  


TLDR: Is there a collection of all BIP papers, suggested technology improvements, and currently discussed tech? I want to get caught up on the history of Bitcoin.

Question about mining rewards,"Hey guys! I'm new to Reddit and I had some thought that crossed my mind so I thought why not post them here.

* How would the next reward decrease for miners affect the price? Would the increased ""rarity"" of the coin increase the value?
* What (do you think) will happen when all the Bitcoins have been mined? Will miners be able to keep running their hardware with only transaction rewards (implying alot of people are using bitcoin by then and it has not died yet)

Hope I'm not breaking any subreddit rules with this post!",1519220850,21/02/2018 13:47:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z5mxm/question_about_mining_rewards/,1

Regarding the 'double spend' problem,"Satoshi's Bitcoin whitepaper highlighted how Blockchain eliminates the 'double spend' problem by having a transparent, distributed ledger for transactions.

The wording around this double spend 'problem' made me curious, and I believe it could be taken two ways. 

Firstly, it displays an attempt to safe-proof the new technology; it shows that this new digital currency is actually viable by being resistant to tampering. But it then leads one to question whether this wording was also used in an effort to show how an ***existing*** problem of double spending can be solved. 

That got me thinking, could this double spending issue be widespread in the traditional, centralised Banking systems? I'm not tech-savvy enough to understand the systems upon which these fiat transactions are facilitated, but I assume they're not run on anything decentralised like Blockchain - certainly not yet, at least. 

Therefore, is it possible for large Banks to get away with double spending of transactions? If so, have there ever been any notable cases where this was executed and exposed?",1519222947,21/02/2018 14:22:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z5vah/regarding_the_double_spend_problem/,9

"My girlfriend and I spent the last 3 months creating a unique crypto portfolio app - one tap trade imports, historical tracking, event triggers, etc. Can we have some feedback?","We posted a while back to this sub looking for beta testers, and we've finally finished fixing most of the bugs and implemented a couple of new stuff. Thank you to all who beta tested and your valuable feedback!!

Here's a quick gif on imgur: https://imgur.com/a/8y4t6

It has a minimalist UI, and if you trade a lot, you can import your trades directly from an exchange with your read-only API and it'll automatically calculate your average buy-ins/profits/price bought at that time, etc. Currently has ATH and price triggers but more coming.

It's only available on Play Store now, but our iOS version will be out in 2 weeks. No ads.

We would highly appreciate it if you have any feedback for us, constantly looking to improve!

I could ask an 18+yr old to transfer me btc to my bittrex account but that still does not rule out the legal aspect.

My friend made a free tool to help you with your Crypto taxes! It takes your transaction history and describes it in USD format for tax documentation.,"Tax season is upon us and there is a lot of confusion around taxing Crypto. I didn't even know where to start because the data I got from exchange sites had no information about the US dollar amounts I was using in my transactions. Either Bitcoin to Litecoin exchanges or the many other Altcoins. My friend made a tool to help me! It takes the excel sheet you can download from exchanges such as Poloniex, uses your transaction timestamps to create a searchable URL that tracks down the exact price of Bitcoin in US dollars at the moment you made that transaction say, May 8th at 12:08:26 AM. 
Then it uses historical price at that time and the coin amount you traded to find the transaction amount in USD.

 Watch how it works in this YouTube video:

[Bitaxx Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOp0oIJ1flM)

Or download the tool from here:

[Bitaxx Tool Download](http://ge.tt/3GCXLdo2)


With this information you, or hopefully your accountant, can interpret your capital gains in friendlier dollar amount format for tax documentation.

I hope this tool saves you both time and money this tax season!
Please leave any suggested improvements in the comments here or on YouTube and my friend will keep the software up to date with your requests!

Cheers

"I'm a 45 year old with arthritis and I built an anonymous futures exchange (Gold, Crude Oil, Sports, etc.) in C#; All trades settle in Bitcoin; Site is very rough, needs some QA / testing","The site: https://www.bitfutures.co

TLDR: I work in the futures industry and thought it might be fun to build a simple, anonymous futures exchange that uses Bitcoin as a settlement mechanism instead of fiat. My ultimate goal is to discover some talented futures traders to whom my company (a financial firm in hedge fund space) can allocate trading capital.

For now I'm just looking for 2 or 3 guys to buy (or short) a couple of different futures contracts on my site and let me know how things work for you. Shoot me an email and let me know you're participating. I'll try to provide a bid/ask in your market of interest so you can execute a market order or alternatively, try placing a limit order and I'll trade with you. 

-- ENHANCEMENTS FROM RECENT FEEDBACK --

- SegWit support (bech32 addresses only; no P2SH support just yet); 

- New binary futures contracts (e.g. 'prediction markets') which settle at 0.00 or 100.00 based on the outcome of NHL hockey games and MMA fights. See the /markets page for a complete list of markets.

-- WARNINGS --

- I designed this site on my own so needless to say it doesn't have the level of polish that one might expect from a professional dev team. I acknowledge that it has a bit of an 'amateur' vibe right now and is still a work in progress.  

- Do NOT deposit more than $100.00 (apprx .01) worth of BTC for this trial. 

- Deposits will be visible in your ledger after two confirmations or approximately twenty minutes.

- When withdrawing your funds, a transaction fee rate will be recommended to you. You can use that rate or choose a custom rate. If you enter a custom fee rate lower than 10 sat/byte, your transaction may remain unconfirmed for an inordinate amount of time. Please see https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/ for fee rate recommendations. 

- Bitcoin is the only crypto supported. Please don't send BCash.

Nonprofit donation processing?,"Hi folks.  I run a small nonprofit, and a donor would like to give us a portion of a bitcoin. 

She suggested setting up processing with Bitpay, but Bitpay (after 3 weeks of waiting for a support ticket) say now they can not process payments to DC where we are incorporated.   I next looked at Coinbase but frankly got freaked out looking at all the complaints in the subreddit---and they say they're not accepting any new merchant accounts.   I was able to sign up for Coinbase Commerce, but it looks like that's a place to hold some currency and it doesn't solve the issue of how to convert into cash so we can use it to fund our programs and services.

A full day of googling has yielded no help and old posts on this sub that speak to this question haven't caught up to the times.  Any ideas?

(Note: I don't care about whether money goes through a bank, and I don't really care about processing fees.  I just want to be able to process the donation.  We need the $!)",1519244241,21/02/2018 20:17:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z8ohz/nonprofit_donation_processing/,1

I just don’t get it !,"I can’t stop feeling that this is the greatest scam of our generation. I can’t stop looking back at the Harlem shake as a point in history for the internet. We moved onto the ALS ice bucket challenge. I’ve even read headlines from once so called ‘lad pages’ of millennials eating fucking capsules that you stick in the washing machine but ‘Crypto Currency’ is the most bizarre to date. 

Humans are retards. 
We all have strengths that no one in else in this world has or ever will have. We all have something to contribute to this planet. We are just over powered by the economy as to what skill is worth more in value. It’s crippling. 
But Bitcoin !?

Like wtf ? 

My problem isn’t the fact that I have no fucking clue what purpose bitcoin will have in our future technology or even will it have any contribution to it.

Anyone know who is doing the huge amount of consolidation transactions?,"Not complaining, just curious. It seems someone has a lot of outputs to consolidate probably an exchange. They are processing them all at 1.1 sat/b and the transactions always have 30 inputs and 1 output. Makes sense to do it now, but does mean we probably won't see the mempool truly empty till they are finished.

Seems they are working downward in terms of value for each output. Down to about 0.0041 now. I think there is a lot left still.

Here's a link showing a block that included a lot of the transactions. https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions?q=block_id(510301)&amp;s=input_count(desc) load a few more rows and you will see what I mean.

You can notice it on mempool graphs as well. There is a constant increase in 1 sat/b transactions. They have been doing this for a few days but turned it off sometimes when the transactions started to fill the mempool too much. It's been going for at least 24 hours now.

Edit: A bit more info, they stopped about two hours ago, you can clearly see the change in the number of 1sat/b transactions on https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,8h just before 7:00. Look at the mb graph not the fees or number of transactions. It doesn't show well in those.

I also estimate that the number of consolidations completed so far in February is 14,400 transactions which is 432,000 inputs or just under 130mb of consolidations. ",1519250289,21/02/2018 21:58:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7z9hf7/anyone_know_who_is_doing_the_huge_amount_of/,20

Legality of Bitcoins in Algeria,"Crypto-currencies have long stayed overlooked by Algerian bureaucrats. Not anymore. In October 2017 there appeared an information in local medias that the National People's Congress (NPC) is on the verge of voting for 2018 Finance Bill, which will outlaw digital money purchase, sale, usage and ownership in the country. Reportedly, an anonymity of crypto-transactions is what primary bothering local lawmakers. Still, this ban has remained un-imposed and trading crypto is legal in Algeria.

A model for bitcoin-related project funding,"Innovations in the field of decentralisation, focusing on such issues as exclusion of man-in-the-middle in trustless environments, protecting user, data and financial privacy, asset inalienability and censorship-resistance need to be funded by the community in a transparent and unregulated way with proper long-term capitalistic rewards both to project founders, key persons and investors. ROI for such persons must be proportional only to the amount of risk appetite of betters and overall project success and adoption.

Existing models of funding being popular in crypto community, such as pre-mine or ICO, do not suit these goals, usually being easily censorable by regulators, vulnerable to thefts (due to centralised cost storage on accounts). Also they lead to uncontrollable inflation in overall volume of cryptocurrency, diminishing value of existing currencies in unpredictable way and creating risks for new economical crises of deleveraging as can happen with many loosely-connected assets without clear and predictable market supply.

Other alternatives, being explored by bitcoin community, like self-funding, charity, value-added services (consulting etc), early mining etc have many other drawbacks such as reward not proportional to the project success or the risk undertaken, difficulties with attracting pre-launch funding, free-rides and generic ""left""-type of approach (""for the benefit of community"").

Here I propose a new scheme for funding which does not inflate the overall volume of digital gold however creates ROI for the founders and developers with a decentralised treasury and dividends, making possible also early-stage funding of such projects with venture capital.

The generic idea is the following:

* a new type of blockchain is created, which primary token (tokenA) is linked to bitcoin blockchain either as a sidechain (once/if it will be adopted in Bitcoin mainnet) or with a proof of burn, atomic swaps and demurrage (for achieving 1-to-1 linking with bitcoin with two-way liquidity) but without pre-mine or mining;

* the blockchain takes pre-defined commission from each transaction; this commission is allocated not on an account but as a blockchain-based basic supply for some blockchain-based secondary token (tokenB);

* tokenB represents dividends token: all token owners receive part of the commission proportional to their share in total tokenB supply (i.e. dividends are paid by network/consensus/protocol);

* tokenB tokens can be pre-mined, sold to investors, given as an options and issued in any other possible way that suits needs and plans of founders and project investors.",1519258962,22/02/2018 00:22:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zajfc/a_model_for_bitcoinrelated_project_funding/,1

"Bitstamp ""lost"" $15,000 of my dollars","I opened an account on Bitstamp and wired $15000 dollars to it at the beginning of the year.  After waiting weeks and weeks for the funds to clear I contacted support and asked them what was going on.  They said they don't have any record of any such transfer.  I had my bank request a receipt from the recipient bank, and sure enough Bitstamp received the funds the day after I sent them.  

  

I've provided Bitstamp with the reference number for the transaction that their bank provided, so it should be trivial for them to sort this out, but I haven't heard anything from them in over 2 weeks.

Kraken verification is a joke,"So I posted this on Kraken's sub, but it appears they monitor all posts and it is now showing removed.  However, I still have it so here it is.  Fuck kraken for censoring

TLDR: I think I'll be collecting social security before Kraken verifies me (I'm in my 30s). See below for my experience with pictures. Oh and a PSA, apparently they don't like you using a scanner for your ID. Please show me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember seeing that instruction anywhere. Read on for details:

I have been waiting for weeks for Tier 3 verification with Kraken and just got an e-mail saying my submissions were somehow incorrect. Part of me is wondering if they are just sending that out automatically because they just can't provide their service and need an excuse for time. I think their next e-mail is going to be ""sorry our dog ate your verification."" My god, use some of that Mt. Gox money to hire some people to look at 3 pictures... how hard could that be. Ever heard of a temp agency? These exchanges are a joke. Coinbase/GDAX (a service for trading anonymous currencies that inspects every transfer- way to understand your market. I got banned and don't use DNMs or anything against their TOS but good luck getting a response with a reason why). Gemini's service makes me really hope Zuckerberg did steal their idea...they would have tanked that faster than it took Mark. And now Kraken: Here is my e-mail exchange and links to the original images submitted:

Hi ,
We're reviewing your Tier 3 documents and there is a problem preventing your ID verification. We need to ask that you please upload a new clearer photo of your ID. Please take the photo with a camera and not a scanner.
Also, your ID image cannot be processed because it does not follow condition #1.
Please ensure the following conditions are met for your US Government issued ID: 1. Uncropped ID - All four edges are contained within the image. 2. Legibility - All document information is clear. 3. Background - Place ID on a dark &amp; contrasting surface. 4. Limit Tilt - Take photo directly above the ID. 5. Orientation - Ensure the ID is correctly rotated/upright. 6. Lighting - Use sufficient light without a flash. 7. Security Seal - The ID's Security Seal feature should not be visible in the photo. 8. Shadow - No shadow should be covering the ID.
Lastly, your ID confirmation photo could not be accepted because WE REQUIRE YOU TO HOLD BOTH YOUR ID AND A PIECE OF PAPER that says, ""Only for trading digital currency on www.kraken.com"" in the picture. The paper should also have today's date and your signature written on it.
Please see this support article for full details about the ID confirmation photo: https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/204061056-What-is-an-ID-confirmation-photo-

Check also the spelling of “www.kraken.com”. Please don't forget the current name and signature on the paper. Lastly, hold the ID on the edge only to avoid covering ID details.
Please upload a new high resolution color image of your files in your Kraken account under Get Verified &gt; Tier 3 at your earliest convenience.
Thanks for your help.

My Response: Ok, so this is absurd. I run multiple online businesses on my own and am appalled at your lack of service. If I can respond to thousands of customers in less than an hour, you should be able to look at 3 pictures in less than 2 weeks. I have tried uploading new pictures for the 1st and 3rd, and the original utility bill and your stupid site says it is not the right size... IT IS! It is the exact picture that was uploaded previously and surprisingly you didn't deny it for having a wrinkle or some nonsense. So now I can't even upload the pictures. I am attaching the new pictures and hope you can resolve this in a REASONABLE amount of time. I will be uploading this encounter online for others to make an informed decision when it comes to finding a respectable and functional market. The images are attached to this e-mail. Please don't tell me to upload them because your site is preventing me.

PS: I've tried uploading again while writing this and now it says the dimensions on a different photo has invalid dimensions (only one when the other was taken with the same dimensions!). Ironically it has no problem with the utility bill now. You site sucks as much as your service. I hope this doesn't mean I have to wait another 2 weeks. Btw, I followed all the instructions to a T before and now. Just let me know if I need to hire Annie Liebowitz to take a picture up to your standards... I'll send you the bill.

Have an old Bitcoin wallet.. No idea what application I created it with but can't open it. Can someone help me?,"(Throw away for obvious reasons)

Hi /r/Bitcoin! Today I found an old wallet on my old computer's harddrive; but I need help opening it. When running bitcoin core I get the following error:

https://i.imgur.com/rWSkGwG.png

Here's what my Bitcoin folder looks like:

https://i.imgur.com/zjoJQzu.png

As you can see I've had this wallet since sometime in 2012. No idea if there's coins inside, no idea what the password could be.. But as of right now I can't open it. 

Does anyone have an idea on wallets I could try? Anyone seen this error before?

**Edit**: Upon opening it with a new version of the Bitcoin Core wallet and no arguments it worked, but when I clicked Receive -&gt; Put address into Blockchain.info it showed the address as no transactions ever took place. Did I do something wrong or should I try something else instead of waiting for it to sync?

**Edit2:** New Post https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zgzz9/found_a_linux_harddrive_and_want_to_find_my_btc/

**Edit3:** I'm still working to open this wallet. I'm syncing the full chain on BTC core and I'm going to move the wallet.dat into my appdata/bitcoin folder one more time and hope it works for some reason (even though I'm syncing the chain on the current same wallet.dat right now)",1519277783,22/02/2018 05:36:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zcixr/have_an_old_bitcoin_wallet_no_idea_what/,1

Whats the best platform to buy crypto with fiat currency?,"I've been using Coinbase till I lost access to my email which made me find out their customer support is **dreadful**, and so I am thinking of Bitstamp as Kraken times out every time I try to verify. 


What platform do you use? Which one do you think is best? **Please** include any fees that you encounter. Something like cex.io has fees between 8-10% which is just WAY too high.

Bitcoin newbie question about pools and hashrate,"Hey guys
i am a total newb and looking to get into the bitcoin craze. Doing my homework in starting to mine in a cloud, my own machine or the infamous bitclub. So i see that mining in a cloud is the worst idea as you make the least money. Mining your own is a good option as i am not doing it on a big scale i probably will have max 2 antminers. but then i came accross bitclub , and saw that the bitclub people are making 4 times more the bitcoin i can make on mining my own. I tried asking as many sponsors i could find and the only answer i was able to get is the following :
"" the reason we make more is that we have low hardware cost and you are buying a share in a pool not cloud mining which means that as we have a big hashrate we get more bitcoins as we get most of the rewards which is 12.5 bitcoins right now. this a competition and the bigger hashrate takes all the rewards. If you mine yourself with low hashrate you will get less bitcoins""

I am not sure if this makes any sense to me. as logically its totally incorrect. but being newb i want to know if there is any truth to it. or is this bitclub is a scam like everyone keeps saying. 

thanks for all your help guys i really appreciate it",1519290343,22/02/2018 09:05:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zdk9q/bitcoin_newbie_question_about_pools_and_hashrate/,0

We as a community need to stop spreading this HODL meme,"For anyone bothered by the potential transparency and frankness of the upcoming post, please look at my username.

This HODL meme is delusional and borderline pathetic and is one of the main reasons people lost so much money recently. I have been a trading maniac on BTC since 2013, and have made more money on shorting it in the last month than the amount of money I made from holding BTC and other cryptos the entire year in 2017. If you're in it to make money (which let's admit, we all are), trading is the way to go. Given this is a completely speculative asset with no fundamental value (cue the disagreeing comments as usual time and time again), it is actually much better to trade and not emotionally attach yourself to something. Focus on making money, which as we all know is the reason why you're here. Otherwise, you'd actually be spending cryptos for useful services, a function for which the ship has sailed and won't happen due to human greed.",1519306420,22/02/2018 13:33:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zewda/we_as_a_community_need_to_stop_spreading_this/,0

MimbleWimble's Story,"I love the Satoshi Nakamoto story and the mystery around it. There's another tale about the MimbleWimble privacy protocol, and it's just as intriguing. Source: [Let's Talk Bitcoin #356](https://soundcloud.com/mindtomatter/ltb-356-privacy-on-the) with Andreas Antonopolous and Adam Levine.

* A user who has never logged in before shows up in Bitcoin developer's IRC channel
* Goes by the name of ""Tom Elvis Jedusor"" (French anagram for ""Je suis Voldemort."" In English, Harry Potter's archnemesis Lord Voldemort went by the name of Tom Marvolo Riddle)
* Posts one message to Tor site, logs out and is never seen again
* Tor site has paper written by user, entitled ""MimbleWimble""
* In the Harry Potter universe, ""MimbleWimble"" is a spell that makes the target tongue-tied, which is a reference to privacy
* MimbleWimble was already a fully formed idea when the user dropped it
* No one has any idea who this person is

Legendary. 

The math around it is very cool as well.

I think it is a great innovation but I don't think bitcoin is going to go to the moon so fast, nor it will get that much mainstream usage. If we want to use it in the daily governments are going to take part in it one way or another.

- And the avg. tx fee is now(!) 28 USD. --&gt; Oh really, good that you tell me, because I thought it would have become less the recent weeks/days  which must then apparently be a lie! /s

- And transactions are only finalized after one hour --&gt; oh really? good you tell me /s (of cause no mention about the real trade offs and developments underway)

- [The Best One]: There are only 16.8 Million coins. By far not enough to serve as a mean to purchase goods and services --&gt; Oh really? So much less than 16 Million people can use Bitcoin! Good that you tell me, because I always believed it is divisible up to 8 digits after the comma. /s

That doesn't look Decentralized to me.,"
I feel one of the biggest questions facing the bitcoin community is where would bitcoin be without the whales and where is bitcoin with the whales?


The moves of individuals can affect the market cap, which in turn affects bitcoin as a whole. Concentration is centralization.

PSA: Learn what HODL stands for (hint: it's NOT an acronym),"I see a lot of people refering to HODL as being an acronym of Hold On For Dear Life. Even the next president of the United States, mr. Giancarlo, spoke about hodling in this meaning. BUT this is false. 

Thinking of HODLing in the sense of ""holding on for dear life"" gives it an extremely negative connotation. As if everything around and about bitcoin is going to burn to the ground and hodlers are mindlessly squeezing their bitcoin, willingly ignorant that it's all going to hell, because hey, we all really know it's all just worthless magic internet money, right? Kinda like [this dude](https://imgur.com/gallery/c4jt321). That's not what HODL is about! 

HODL's origin is [this thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0) on bitcointalk. It's a drunken rant from a wannabe day trader (GameKyuubi) who got burned too many times trying to time the market. He was not talking about hodling no matter what happens, he was not talking about hodling to his grave and never ever selling (some) of his bitcoin. In fact... The essence of HODLing can be found in the last couple of words of that post. 

&gt; ... traders can only take your money if you sell.

Think about that.    ",1519317571,22/02/2018 16:39:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zg7y5/psa_learn_what_hodl_stands_for_hint_its_not_an/,28

Good advice,"
Since starting in January I've made and lost some but not without a lot of volatility ... Seen it go up and down

These are the things I've learnt:

It was a mistake to believe that anybody knew what the market was going to do. No disrespect meant, many of you clearly have really good insight into things, but I am yet to see any proof that people have any real grasp of what's happening.

Even if you are sensible and only invest an amount you are happy to lose, be very aware that the amount you think you are happy to lose is a lot higher when deep down you don't think you're going to lose it.

I am not really cut out for this. I've had some fun and the excitement you get when you see your coin climbing is great, but it seems to be a game of ever diminishing returns, and at this stage, with my limited knowledge and ability, I've realised this is just gambling and that's not something I want to get too involved with: I urge all of you to take a step back and ask yourself if you are just gambling too, and if the answer is yes, please be very careful. Gambling can be hugely addictive and destructive, so please be really honest with yourselves and careful. 

Fingers crossed and no doubt I'll see a bit of green and get all excited again, but hopefully I'm not going to get too crazy with all this.",1519318422,22/02/2018 16:53:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zgc2v/good_advice/,4

Found a linux hard-drive and want to find my btc wallet on it,"Yesterday I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zcixr/have_an_old_bitcoin_wallet_no_idea_what/) about how I found my old windows harddrive and found the wallet.dat. I kept looking through my box of shit and found a linux one as well, and I'm pretty sure I used linux for my BTC stuff back then.

Since I'm on Windows now, I downloaded this program called ""Ext2"" and was able to open the harddrive using Windows' File Explorer, but I don't know where or what I'm looking for now. Does anyone have some tips as to what a wallet could be called, or what linux wallet I might have used? (2011-2013 era)

Edit: The hard drive has 3 partitions, with 3 different formats. EXT2, which I checked manually and doesn't have anything about a wallet (it's only 85MB though), FAT32 (which I couldn't open, but it's only 510 MB) and RAW (which is 297GB and looks more promising). I was going to download [EaseUs](https://www.easeus.com/resource/raw-file-system-to-ntfs.htm) to help me open these, but I want a second opinion first before I fuck up and destroy more Bitcoins",1519323390,22/02/2018 18:16:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zgzz9/found_a_linux_harddrive_and_want_to_find_my_btc/,6

BTC on trial today in San Diego,"This guy was arrested for selling BTC to an undercover fed. He's walking into court today to defend BTC. He represents us all.  He put his phone number on his twitter asking for moral support.  Send him a text of encouragement.  Let him know we got his back.

@NODEfather on twitter

video with arrest story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu7nl_-vBns

EDIT:

TL:DW - The defendant's lawyer thinks the feds are setting up a case to base a future law on regarding bitcoin.  See 14:43 - 15:09 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu7nl_-vBns&amp;t=14m43s

The defendant claims that he broke no law, several federal agents did break the law including entrapment and spying, and that he has been targeted.  He is a worthwhile target for the feds because of his effectiveness in training multiple branches of the US military in how bitcoin works so that they would someday adopt BTC on a large scale.  Mass adoption of BTC scares the feds and they must protect their dollar.

EDIT2:

He was given 10 more days to find and pay for a lawyer.  https://twitter.com/NODEfather/status/966852090839486465",1519324085,22/02/2018 18:28:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zh3f8/btc_on_trial_today_in_san_diego/,1100

Understanding the Lightning Network,"We're^^^^^^^. about a month in since advanced users have been using the Lightning Network to send transactions at low fees and at quick rates. Still, people here today have misconceptions about how the Lightning Network works, the pros and cons, and the usage. Let me clear that up right now.


^^^^^^^^^^^^.
##The first thing to understand, is that the Lightning Network is not here to replace ordinary transactions.

Much like batching transactions and other soft-forks, the Lightning Network is here to reduce large amounts of noise. Here's an example where the Lightning Network **can be used:**

- I'm already connected to Network A

- Bob is on Network C

- I know Network A connects to B, and B to C

- I can send Bob BTC instantly over the LN

**Here's an example where the LN cannot be used:**

- Bob has no BTC in his wallet, he's a new user

- Bob buys BTC on coinbase

- Bob tries to send himself BTC from coinbase over LN

This won't work because **Bob needs some Bitcoin to connect to the network in the first place**.

^^^^^^^^^^^^.
##It's not Centralized just because people use the most convenient node

I see graphs on /r/Btc explaining how it's an unsolved ""np complete problem"", they're drawing out graphs and shit showing all the nodes connecting to one ""BIG NODE"". **Even if a node refuses your payment, you can simply go around it.** Even if one node had 90% of the transactions, them disappearing is more than likely **not going to change shit**, because this is all under the hood anyways.

^^^^^^^^^^^^.
## The Lightning Network isn't this complex thing, where you have to worry about tracking your funds across the globe.

All of this is hidden under the beautiful magic of a simple GUI. When you first started using Bitcoin for your transactions, I'm more than sure that most of you didn't understand how it gets added to the mempool and verified in blocks. **This is not an aspect you need to worry about**

^^^^^^^^^^^^.
## Closing a node to scam someone really just doesn't work
Here's a far-fetched example where closing a node to scam someone works:

- Bob wants to pay Charlie

- Bob tells Charlie he's going to create a Lightning Network node to transact

- Bob and Charlie both pay a transaction fee and wait 10 minutes to connect to **Bob's** Lightning Network

- Bob sends the money to Charlie, but tells Charlie to stay on the Node

- Bob closes the Node when Charlie goes offline.

Since no one else is connected to the node to protest, he's able to close it at an ""earlier date"" than when he paid Charlie to close the node on **effectively reversing the transaction**.

**Cases where it doesn't work**

1) Charlie tells bob to fuck off and just pay him through a normal transaction

2) Charlie leaves the Lightning Network after receiving the payment

3) Bob's Lightning Network grows and becomes too large to close at a dishonest time

It's also worth noting, you can only possibly get scammed if you're transacting with the owner of the network.

*****
^^^^^^^^^.

Hopefully you all understand how LN works a little better now, and the future of micropayments that can come along with it :). There are a few wallets being developed right now to support LN (such as the [ZAP](https://zap.jackmallers.com/) wallet, and if you guys are aware of any others I can add them to the thread.


Thanks for reading!

"The narrative (that batching isn't responsible for the mempool drop), and why it's wrong.","There has been a very clever and insidious narrative I've seen around in other subreddits lately, and even in this subreddit, so I'm going to clarify why it's wrong for everyone.

The narrative is this: Bitcoin's fees are down and the mempool is clear, but *that's only because usage is way down*. The way this narrative is clever is because it triggers people to bring up batching and segwit and then get shot down by an argument which seems accurate but is actually extremely misleading. The argument is this: Batching wouldn't lower outputs so look at the outputs and you can see Bitcoin isn't being used much anymore.

Here's why it's misleading: **BATCHING DOES DECREASE OUTPUTS. BY A LOT.**

#Let me explain:

[If you look at the average transaction in Bitcoin, it has two outputs](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions). One output is the value the *sender* is sending to the *receiver*, and the other is the leftover amount from the inputs which then goes to the *change address* of the *sender* so they can use it again.

So let's say that Coinbase, prior to implementing batching, is doing (this is just a theoretical example, not the actual number) 1,000,000 transactions per day. That means they have 1,000,000 transactions with (on average) 2 outputs each. Now, they implement batching and go from 1,000,000 transactions to 1,000. How many change outputs do those 1,000 transactions need? **Only 1 each.**

Boom, you just lowered outputs from 2,000,000 per day to 1,002,000 per day.

-----

**Correct this narrative wherever you see it. It's clever in that is *seems* accurate enough that people don't question it, and that is harmful to our community.**",1519345196,23/02/2018 00:19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zjsfl/the_narrative_that_batching_isnt_responsible_for/,9

What the Lightning Network will become.,"The Lightning network seems like the perfect solution to all of Bitcoins problems: its transfer speeds are fast and its fees are low compared to Bitcoin. But the end result will not be a super decentralized currency that everyone can use with ease. In fact what will happen is the opposite, it will become just as centralized as the currencies it was designed to replace, and here is why. The Lightning Network is designed so that people create channels from one person to another that must be topped up with as much bitcoin as will ever go through that channels. If you want to get pizza, for example, you don't want to create a new channel as that can be expensive. So the idea is that once there are enough channels, you will be able to route to any place, a lot like the internet. So say you want to buy a pizza, but you don't have a channel to the pizza restaurant, but you have a channel to Bob your friend, and he has one to Steve his friend, who has a link to the pizza restaurant, so you are routed through Bob to Steve to the pizzeria. Along the way each person can charge a fee to route you through them, so there is an incentive to do so. People will want to route you because they gain a small amount of money. This is obviously going to cause a problem: large institutions will form massive routing networks and will rake in the money from routing the Bitcoin, and if businesses want to get business they will need to go through these institutions. Sound familiar? That's right those are banks. The Lightning Network is disguised as the solution to the flaws in a decentralized currency, but it will only end up creating a super-centralized currency run by banks. Think about it, it is the only reason banks are not resisting Bitcoin.",1519345517,23/02/2018 00:25:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zjtrf/what_the_lightning_network_will_become/,0

Legality of Bitcoins in Argentina,"Argentina, reportedly, has the most crypto enthusiasts per capita in the world. However, it hasn't came as a result of local bureaucrats' educated insights and genuine enthusiasm towards digital economy. Instead, Banco Central de la Republica Argentina (BCRA) has been persistently issuing multiple statements warning ""unsuspected"" Argentinians of imminent hazards intrinsic to using crypto-currencies. The bank head repeats time and time again that virtual cash is not issued by the central bank and is not legal.

He is joined by the Argentina's Financial Information Unit (FIU), which, in its communications with financial companies, constantly warns them on the risk of money laundering closely tied to crypto-transactions. If all of those out-dated rhetorics still haven't resulted in punitive actions may only be attributed to the fact that the Argentine financial authorities just have much bigger economic issues to worry about.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: moderately friendly;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally, South America;
industries to focus: e-commerce, fintech, entertainment, food;
major limitations: high administrative barriers to SME, excessive taxation, over-bureaucratization, high unemployment rate, sluggish economy, high crime rate, growing competition from neighboring countries for South American market;
stimulus: growing youth population, Internet high penetration rate (around seventy percents), developed economy.
opportunities: many in mobile apps and FinTech;
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (positive).

Bitcoin and Taxes Help,"Hello everyone, 


I am somewhat young and stupid and I definitely don't know much about taxes so please excuse any dumb questions/comments I may have. 


Anyways, I ve in the US and i have been been paying someone to do my taxes for the last two years. This year, however, I bought and sold some Bitcoin. 


I bought:

-$500 on 12/21/17

-$500 on 12/30/17


And I sold:

-$1,043.19 on 1/5/18


Yes, I know I barely scratch the surface of crypto trading but that was enough to know that this isn't for me. 


I was wondering, what do I have to do to report my bitcoin taxes to the IRS. I've tried doing research but I've honestly just ended up even more confused than when I started. 


Can someone tell me what to do?",1519361846,23/02/2018 04:57:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zljpw/bitcoin_and_taxes_help/,1

CEX.IO Are they really SCAM? GIVE ME MY 5500USD...,"(request# 651767)

It was really painful agony to get answer from CEX.IO that they would refund my money. (you can't even imagine. It has been nearly a month.) They said they sent my money back not providing ANY KIND OF PROOF(receipt, MT-103, etc.)

Feb 16, CEX.IO said ""Your funds should have reach your bank account."" 

So I was really grateful!!!, what a relief!!
I replied them. thank you (I typed Thank you a lot..)

I thought I can finally get out of this agony!

I visited my bank many times wishing my money back.
But. oddly enough, there's no money. and ask them, they said
""We would kindly ask you do not worry and be sure that the funds should be available on your bank account in a short time.""

## Even now(Feb 23), I don't get any money(USD 5500) nor e-mail from them!!##

I visited my bank many many times, but I can't learn any further because all of information they provided is that ""they sent money."" and they refuse to provide the information.(by ignoring my e-mail)

Is it true that CEX.IO wired money?? or they are just lying? 

They sent me very short message (We are sorry for this delay, and we have increased the priority of your ticket. Please wait for an update from the Finance team.)

And even now, they don't give ANY CLEAR EXPLANATION what has caused this.

How ridiculous it is!
Where did you send my money??? 
And they don't explain even after a week!
This is unreal. 

CEX.IO is based on U.K.
I admired U.K. because I think they are the origin of modern civilization.
My dream of England has been shattered by CEX.IO and their irresponsibility.

Back in my country(South Korea), This kind of accident(or SCAM) will not be tolerated by Judicial authority.

I can't believe this and I am really outraged by it.
please help me to get my money back......
I will update on REDDIT about this.

Taxes on forks?,"A lot of the articles I read seem to talk about claiming the Bitcoin Cash fork as income on the day of the fork. This may make sense if there was only one fork per year or something. This position sounds asisine to me. There's been like 20 forks in the past year. Am I really expected to just go through and look up all these shitcoins to see prices of fork at day of inception to find out how much ""income"" I received from these stupid forks, and figure out how many btc I held at that day, ad infinitum? It just makes no sense. It seems to make more intuitive sense to me to just ignore all of them and treat the cost basis as $0 should I inevitably figure out how to cash out any of these pieces of garbage coins.",1519366497,23/02/2018 06:14:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zlza8/taxes_on_forks/,1

Cipher your private keys in 3 easy ways,"
1.) Take any random number ( 2 for example ) , and add this number to all numerics in private key. So, 1 will become 3 , 2 will become 3 , ……, 8 will become 0 , 9 will become 1 , 0 will become 2. Plaintext Private Key : 1hj7uy6yt5 Ciphertext Private Key : 3hj9uy8yt7

2.) Take any random number ( 2 for example ) , and shift alphabets by same number in private key. So, “a” will become “c” , “b” will become “d” , ……., “y” will become “a” , “z” will become “b”. Plaintext Private Key : 1hj7uy6yt5 Ciphertext Private Key : 1jl7wa6av5

3.) Combining both methods — Method 1 and Method 2. So, 1 will become 3 and similarly, alphabets will change from “a” to “c” and so on. Plaintext Private Key : 1hj7uy6yt5 Ciphertext Private Key : 3jl9wa8av7

You can make your own combinations like changing only last numeric/alphabet using above method. But, whatever you choose just don’t make it too complex so that it becomes impossible for you to break later. So, pick a simple one which you can remember easily.

Working method to withdraw Crypto at an ATM,"**The Problem.**

Being able to ‘cash out’ BTC or ALT’s to GBP at an ATM without waiting days has always been important to me and with ever tighter regulations this is becoming far less straightforward. 

Like most I had a couple of Crypto to ATM cards, ([Wirex](http://wireexapp.com), TenX) that have since became defunct when VISA cancelled all cards linked to Wave crest without warning back in January. 

Since then I have been looking for a way to simply withdraw GBP/EUR/USD quickly and without too much scrutiny.

**What have I been looking for?**

•	I have wanted the ability to NOT share too much personal information
•	I need to be able to instantly convert Crypto to Fiat
•	I need to be able to use standard ATM’s
•	I don’t want to pay massive fees.  

**The solution.**

I have found that by linking Spectro with Monese ( a standard pre paid Visa card) I can quickly cash out without too much fuss. 

**What is Spectro ?**

Spectro is an established Crypto exchange who convert Crypto to FIAT but more importantly, who offer SEPA payments  

**What In Monese?**
Monese are an online bank app who will give you a free contactless + ATM card along with a SEPA account number to accept transfers

(Using my  Monese link below gets you £5 and me a small referral fee)


**How to set up**
1) Register for a trader account on [Spectro](https://spectrocoin.com/en/signup.html?referralId=143263920)

2) Register for [Monese](https://monese.com/?utm_expid=.-jhViwKEQM-BmPrOufaxaw.0&amp;utm_referrer=XHBZTSHQ) and have your free card posted to you

3) Convert Crypto in Spectro to FIAT

4) Send FIAT from spectro to your monese account

5) Withdraw FIAT at an ATM.

Anyone interested on trying my Bitcoin app?,"Quick use case examples.

**Find an item** (i.e., a dress) that you may have seen in a magazine or on a website (such as Pinterest or Instagram). If you don’t know where to buy online, you can upload a photo and ask other Bitfortip members to search for it online to win a  bitcoin reward. UI is like Instagram so it's pretty easy to use. 

**Find a better prices** By offering a small Bitcoin reward for members to search for you, you increase your probability of finding that item at a lower cost.

**Find a piece of information** on the internet that you may not know about. Post an inquiry along with a Bitcoin reward for people to find you a certain link, image, etc.


**Once you create an account**	 a bitcoin address is generated where you can then deposit some funds to post an inquiry on the platform. Minimum amount required is 0.0001 BTC roughly 10 cents.

If anyone wants to try it, send me a pm with your **username and what would you like to find, so I can give you some test funds**

P.S 

Currently I am waiting for lightning network as current fees don't allow micro transactions needed for this service to be 100% efficient.

1. Why are you coming on this sub?  
2. If you own/have some BTC, why do you buy/obtain them? What was in your mind to do with them ?  
3. If you believe that Bitcoin is the future, how you deal with daily work surrounded by hatred against Bitcoin?  
4. Are you thinking to quit from your actual gov. job and start a new life/work related with Bitcoin?  

Please, sincere, no remorse answers, we are not here to judge you, whatever answer you have. We just want to see your opinion.

What happened to all of the original developers?,"After getting into cryptocurrency about a year ago, I've been trying to play catch up. First I learned all the technical aspects of blockchain/bitocin. After that, I started diving into the history.  I read ""The Book of Satoshi"", which pretty much aggregates a lot of the important e-mails and posts Satoshi made, along with people involved in the community.  

Among those, were Gavin Anderson (one of the few to use his real name), Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn, and a guy that went by ""Red"". From what I read, Satoshi had some correspondence w/ Gavin after he left in which Gavin mentioned giving a talk to the CIA and asking advice how to handle that. Gavin was also the one who created the first Bitcon faucet, so it seemed he genuinely cared about the project.

Are they still involved in Bitcoin development? I've been trying to fill the gaps between 2011-2017 and now that the dust has settled with the scaling debate, I'm trying to put the pieces together.",1519396965,23/02/2018 14:42:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zohxn/what_happened_to_all_of_the_original_developers/,14

I was hoping to find a business number with support on a google search""

The guy on the other side of phone claims to be from the states "" with an Indian/British accent"" and he was very persistent on trying to allow him to remote access my computer.. I questioned him for about 5 minutes why the f@$ do you need to access my computer if there is a problem with my photo verification process! My photos are already on your server why cant you access them your self?! He never gave a straight answer and at the end it seems the guy was getting kinda inpatient with me and he said my account was going to get removed and banned.. I told him to go f@$ him self and etc..

Later on today.. I had a little flash back about YouTube video I was watching about people falling for a fake virus warning and were prompted to call a number. The YouTube poster called the number was also talking a operator with an Indian accent and wanted remote access to the callers computer..

"" I would never allowed anyone to remote access my computer ever.. but anyone who is not aware of this scam..this needs to be posted ASAP""

Malware To Replace Your Wallet Address With A Fake One,"I will dub this malware 'Faux Address'

It works by waiting dormant until a user copies an address to their clipboard, it then replaces this address with the address of the attacker.

The post below speculates that the malware has a database of addresses and overwrites your copied address with one that closely resembles.

There is also another speculation made that the malware could in other forms, change the address seen in your browser or wallet itself.

If more people could come forward who have fallen victim to this, we can verify both claims.

The post also offers some solutions to this problem that require the community as a whole to co-operate.

I recommend the book Crypto for a brief history of cryptography,"I read Crypto a while ago and thought it was a great overview of some of the technologies that blockchain is based on. It  was written before Bitcoin and it doesn't stray too far into overly technical areas so its an easy read. 

It also looks at how encryption had to wait a long time to find its most widespread use case, e-commerce. It was a technology in waiting which is how I view cryptocurrencies.

So I would be paying long term capital gains on  $15,179.99 - $582.79= **$14,597.20** ? For some reason bitcoin.tax is showing that my cost basis is $3,891.20. Anyone know why?

When would you sell?,"If you were holding just one BTC from 2014 that cost you nothing, when do you think you’d sell?

Say you make decent money and have some credit card debt ($10k), a mortgage ($250k) and some student loans ($30k).  Your job allows you to pay your bill normally, but you break even and they just become bills.   They don’t really negatively affect you due to making enough cash.

However, you have that single BTC that could pay off your credit cards now back to zero!  

If you were doing just OK, would you hold and hope it pays off your credit cards AND some of your student loans?

Would you just hold forever because “it’s free with zero risk!”  Maybe in five years it’ll pay off the $250k mortgage!  

Sell and get out of one debt, to make life a little easier?   That debt isn’t going anywhere from the credit cards.  The BRC was essentially free.

Treat it like a $10,000 scratch off lottery win?  Would you regret paying off your credit cards to zero if BTC shot up to $40k on a year or two?

Question about private keys / master seed,"I need some clarification.

If I use a wallet such as Jaxx to hold multiple coins I understand that, for each coin, all of my addresses, public keys and private keys are generated from my mnemonic phrase and are related to each other.

Let's say I send and receive BTC and other coins, sometimes using new addresses and sometime older addresses.

Some time down the road I have fractions of BTC on multiple non segwit addresses. I decide to consolidate the majority of the BTC to a hardware wallet because I want to move them to a non-hot wallet, segwit address. The rest of the BTC is moved to my most recently generated address in Jaxx so none of my old addresses have any bitcoin on them.

Of course I know to never give away private keys but would it be safe (for the sake of argument), assuming I never plan to use those old addresses again, to post all of my old private keys from the addresses that have no BTC and never will?

Specifically, could many private keys be used in some way to crack the seed they were generated from? Would other coins with addresses generated with the same seed be compromised?

Thank you",1519419530,23/02/2018 20:58:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zrf7t/question_about_private_keys_master_seed/,4

A very little tidbit regarding bitcoin awareness,"I was on vacation in Portugal (EU). There I went in a little 5 m² magazin and tabacco store to buy some stuff for 65€.  

I asked the owner (probably late 40s) if I may pay with ec-card. He said 'yes' but I saw the pain in his eyes (because of the fees he would have to pay). So I asked him if he'd rather take cash. He answered yes, so I gave him cash. Then I said he should consider accepting bitcoin. To my surprise he knew exactly what I'm talking about and replied he has it already in mind and will do it when it starts getting relevant in his eyes.

not much but for me this was a positive experience.",1519427495,23/02/2018 23:11:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zsdxn/a_very_little_tidbit_regarding_bitcoin_awareness/,2

Venezuela is a totalitarist gov, it won't ever be able to fix any kind of problem that it created, it will always only create more and more problems. there is absolutely no way on earth it will ever be able to stabilize the post-apocalyptic state that it became in any shape or form without a complete implosion of its shitty socialist roots. Maduro gov will not work, no matter how hard you want to push solutions, no crypto will help with that.

Thoughts on how centralized Petro will impact decentralized cryptos,"I’ve seen a lot of negative comments about Venezuela’s new Petro. As a centrally controlled blockchain, it will suffer from all of the things you would expect from any kind of Govcoin. Importantly, it will very likely be inflated to greatly exceed what it is legitimately backed by, and so it will likely lose value against decentralized crypto currencies.

However, based on my admittedly limited understanding, I think that the Petro will be highly positive for Bitcoin and other legitimate cryptos. I may be mistaken in some of my assumptions, but if so, I’m sure I’m not the only one with some faulty assumptions, and any corrections would be appreciated.

1. The Petro will be legal tender for at least some purposes for citizens of Venezuela.

2. There is an assurance by the governments issuing Govcoins that the residents of these countries will be able to spend them on certain real goods and services, thus assuring an interface with the real world.  Exchanging Bitcoin for Govcoin that can be spent in the real physical world, creates on and off ramps to fiat and real world assets, without having to go through the banking system.

3. Even though Venezuela controls the issuance and rules governing Petros, whoever owns the private keys will still be able to spend or exchange them without going through the banking system. 

4. Since Petros will be able to be transferred outside of the banking system, they can be sent to crypto-only exchanges where they can be exchanged for other cryptos like Bitcoin. 

5. The Petro will be accepted at least for some purposes by some other governments. This is especially true since they know they can always swap their Petros for more reputable crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.

6. The U.S. imposes sanctions on other countries that prevent their citizens from obtaining many of the goods and services they desire. One of the major ways that the U.S. enforces these sanctions is through its control of the international banking system. Since the Petro will not have to go through the traditional banking system, it will not be as easy for the U.S to tell who the trading partners are and what they are trading, much less to prevent the trade from happening. Since Govcoin users can exchange their fiat-coin for other cryptos having real value such as Bitcoin, without having to go through the international banking system, they are able to bypass some of the U.S. sanctions. This is an important new use-case for Bitcoin and should enhance its value accordingly. 

7. If the Petro is even a little successful, other countries will be encouraged to do the same thing, creating even more on and off ramps to fiat.

Tldr: The Petro may create on-off ramps for crypto-to-fiat without going through the banking system, and using GovCoins to avoid U.S. sanctions is potentially huge, and is at least partially enabled by decentralized cryptos such as Bitcoin.

Legality of Bitcoins in Austria,"Austria is considered to be a relatively crypto-friendly country, specially compare to neighboring Germany with its draconian laws regarding trading and buying crypto-currencies. However, the tide may be turning for Austrian crypto-users as some overzealous government's bureaucrats continue to express their misplaced concerns with the use of crypto-currencies for money laundering.

Among the proposed ""preventive"" measures, which this government intends to promptly execute, are the following: crypto-currencies market participants will be obliged to disclose identities of all trading parties and to reveal trades exceeding ten thousands euro to the financial espionage unit.

It has already become a ""good"" tradition among officeholders of different ranks to blame new technologies for causing unproven and often even non-existing offenses. Looks like there's nothing else left for them to do in order to cover up their own professional ineptitude and general obsolescence. It's a pity that now even generally well-regarded Austrian financial functionaries have became sorrow victims of that hysterical paranoia.

Are people too stupid for bitcoin?,"So I just got a ledger nano S and was reading about all the ways they can intercept your crypto.  It had me thinking of everything that goes into owning crypto and how many intricate ways you can be scammed out of your coins, even with a hardware wallet. 

Most people can't even take care of their belongings. We have car and home insurance, if we forget our pin or lose our bank card we can go to the bank to get another one. 

People will always turn to authority when they get taken for a ride, and I'm a little concerned our society might not want to move back into a society where your assets are entirely your responsibility.

Buying conventional stocks with Bitcoin?,"What sort of options are out there to ""buy"" conventional stocks using Cryptocurrency instead of the traditional broker/bank/etc?

Buy is in quotes because it isn't necessary for me to actually own them, only to profit from them.

I've thought of two sorts of websites and one would be stock trading sites made with serving the Bitcoin community as their primary motive. One example of this is Whaleclub, who has some terrifying reviews.

The other would be conventional stock buying sites which I'm sure exist in every variety. The question is do any of them take Bitcoin as a payment, or alternatively a form of e-money that could be bought with Bitcoin, such as Perfect Money, OKPay and so on.

Any insight into this would be highly appreciated.

Some questions/concerns about the lightning network,"I’ve been really interested in lightning this week and doing a bit of research in my free time.

But there is one thing that is bothering me... why is this awesome network that will push bitcoins future supposedly, making transactions off of the blockchain? 

Isn’t using the blockchain itself the whole point of bitcoin? I mean I understand the ease of use of an off chain system and little to no fees... but I’m worried it’ll turn into a network in which the large lightning nodes become “banks”. Which kinda defeats the purpose of what blockchain tech provides us with? Decentralization. 

It’s becoming a legitimate concern of mine since lightning is being pushed quite hard. I’d love to hear others opinions. Maybe I’m not understand something correctly..

How will Bitcoin progress through this volatility?,"Firstly I would like to say that I am relatively new to the space (six months), and are very much a hodler. I got burnt during the BCH pump and dump and haven't sold or traded any coin or alts since. I truely believe in the technology, more so now the scaling issues seem to be improving (Segwit, and in time lightening).

I am however concerned about the volatility. Recently the market seems to have improved (after a nightmare of a start of the year), but every time it seems to have made some ground, it drops. I am guessing this is not due to 'normal' market conditions, to me it seems that bots, etc. are being used to maximise traders gains. How will Bitcoin overcome this, if every time fresh money enters Bitcoin (and other cryptos for that matter) some one pull profit from the other end? I am not trying to create negativity by any means, I just want to understand from more experienced people how this is likely to play out?",1519468920,24/02/2018 10:42:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zvvzg/how_will_bitcoin_progress_through_this_volatility/,4

Bitclubnetwork,"Hi!

I'm sorry if this was already asked. I searched for similar posts but most of them were about a year old.

My aunt in South Korea recently signed up for bitclubnetwork and invested money with them. I did some research on them and from what I found it is a scam (partially if not all). If anything she will not be able to break even unless she gets more people to sign up.

Correct me if I'm wrong please because it would break my heart to see my elderly aunt get scammed. If it is completely a scam is there anything I can do to get her money back?",1519478682,24/02/2018 13:24:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zwk3h/bitclubnetwork/,4

"Would tweaking pool operator software benefit the security of the network, as well as add value for individual miners?","As I understand it, pool operators always choose which transactions from the memory pool to include. What kind of benefits does this give to a malicious actor in terms of attacking the network if they operate a pool? Choosing which transactions to include is obviously an integral part of how a 51% attack takes place. Is it relevant anywhere else? 

Are there any technical reasons, or any major disadvantage to operating a pool and giving the responsibility for choosing transactions to the miner that solved the block? Or even awarding blockspace on a hasharate share basis to the whole pool? Obviously this can’t be done trustlessly, but it can presumably be done in a way that can be monitored live? It seems like an extra value that mining operators are reserving for themselves, since some already monetise prioritising people’s transactions. If it were to add security AND give miners extra value for money, would it not be something pool operators could use to draw in customers?

Experience in Buenos Aires with BTC,"Hi, I'm traveling at the moments and have been staying in Buenos Aires for the last 2 months. There are ""cambio"" guys all over the city and I imagined that at least a few of these money changers would have heard about Bitcoin by now. Unfortunately, only one of ten I talked to knew what it was and they didn't think it was legal to do (keep in mind that cambio is illegal in Argentina even though these guys are all over the place in public advertising their service). I also tried Local Bitcoins, there were a few listed for cash. After a short texting exchange online I was instructed to go down to an office, however, when I arrived, the person I was talking to over the intercom didn't seem to know about it and wouldn't let me in to the office... 

I did finally manage to find someone through a Bitcoin meet-up who offered to do an exchange for USD so I think I may give this a try. If anyone else out there has any advice or contacts down here for people who would be willing to do a BTC for USD exchange at a fair rate, please let me know.

I noticed that interest just fucking spiked in the spring of 2017, and I'm honestly confused as to how. I remember being in middle school, begging my parents to buy some and them thinking it was a Nigerian prince scam, but what happened that spring to suddenly change that reputation?

CMV: Nobody owns Bitcoin. You simply have information in the form of a password or private key.,"Access to information is not the same as owning that information. I don't think ownership is the correct term for Bitcoin, nor do I think the IRS can define someone as having assets in Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) as it is not physical. 

I know bank accounts aren't physical, and I know that if you have say, 100k in a bank account, you own that money because the US Govt which backs the dollar says you do, and if it gets stolen, the US Govt will reimburse you, (FDIC). 

Bitcoin is different. 

Let us say I have 100 BTC on my hard drive, and I throw away or destroy the hard drive. Do I still own 100 BTC or did I lose it? The BTC is still technically in the wallet, but I have no way of accessing it. Does my access to the BTC define ownership? If I tell someone my wallet password, do they now own it as well? 

Let us take the same hard drive example, only before I destroyed it, I memorized the entire private and public key. I didn't write it down, lets just say I memorized the entire thing. Do I now still own it since I have access to the coins, even though the hard drive has been destroyed? 

My point is that information (which really all Bitcoin is) is not a form of ownership in my view. Therefore I feel in the future as Bitcoin becomes more popular, courts will have trouble proving that someone ""owns"" bitcoin.

Using Bitcoin as a Currency Conversion tool,"Hello, I was wondering if it would be much cheaper to use Bitcoin to convert my euros to british pounds.

I plan on working in the UK and would like to avoid paying a conversion fee if I send myself some starting money (rent, guaranty, food, etc.) from an EUR account to a GBP account.

Basically I would proceed like so :

* Deposit X € on my Bitstamp account
* Buy X in BTC using € on Bitstamp
* Send the BTC to myself on an exchange platform that supports GBP withdrawals (Coinfloor, Kraken ?)
* Withdraw the BTC in GBP on a british bank account

Overall I would only pay ~0.25% when buying BTC and ~0.25% for withdrawal, whereas a regular bank-wire transfer would cost ~3% of currency conversion.

Am I missing something or is it much more profitable to convert money this way ?",1519495661,24/02/2018 18:07:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zyb72/using_bitcoin_as_a_currency_conversion_tool/,2

A Change To Consensus...,"I have stayed up nights wondering how to always improve Bitcoin. It's silly because I have pretty much no knowledge in how to code and program my own ideas but I think i thought of a tweak in consensus that might help with nodes.  Here it goes... 

What if we gave transaction fees to full nodes instead of the miners? 

Now I know miners are already leaving my post by now but just hear me out. Miners are a *good* thing. It creates a surge of greed that gives Bitcoins more and more value. 

Now why am I suggesting incentivizing full nodes? Because we WANT people to run them. More nodes = more security, less trust, and more decentralization. Yet,  there is a cost for those to run one as well. We have to pay for electricity and bandwidth just like miners even if it is on a much smaller scale and it's only getting more expensive. Nodes are much more important than miners when it comes to the integrity of the network. Miners are still important to create that sort of gold rush to Bitcoin. 

I believe there are two ways to pay full node users. One way is to make it just like finding the next block. A random full node in the world can get ALL of the transaction fees and create this mini gold rush for nodes. The other would be more fair to spread out the transaction fees to all full nodes evenly. Maybe more connections,  a bigger cut of the fees. 

Now some of you might bring up how miners will be paid once they're are no more Bitcoins left to mine. Bitcoin is a finite resource. Just like gold or any other finite source. Yet, people still mine for these finite sources even knowing the fact that they will eventually be out of business. They do this because before it runs out,  they are going to make A LOT of money until then so they don't care when that day comes.  For Bitcoin however, even though it will ""run out"" at the year 2140, miners will *still* be there collecting transaction fees. First thing we need to understand is we don't actually *need* the computing power of the miners to create a new block, it can be done without it (example would be proof-of-stake but I AM NOT suggesting turning BTC into PoS). All you need are the nodes at that point and bitcoin will deflate ever so slowly as people continue to lose them. 

As years go by, we have had a steady decline on nodes and more users thinking there is no point of running one which IS NOT what bitcoin is about, yet nodes are getting more and more expensive to run. I believe we need to change consensus to give full node runners an incentive to run them which I believe will not only protect and make bitcoin stronger, but also help in increasing Bitcoin's value and everyone wants that.

However, with Kucoin the bitcoin.tax website asks me to generate and upload an ""API key"" as well as the ""secret"". I noticed other exchanges had to option to view only or read only with permissions but Kucoin has no such option. 

I read what others have posted and if I provide my API key and secret from Kucoin will this bitcoin.tax website basically have free reign over all of my funds?

has anyone managed to buy the lightning stickers on windows?,"so im trying to get lightning running on mainnet ON WINDOWS so i can buy a sticker

i got lnd/zap running on mainnet. i can buy mainnet.yalls.org articles no problem. i can open channels to reckless, rompert, bitrefill, mainnet.yalls. i cannot open a channel with the blockstream store node (peer disconnected) and i cannot send them payment over a different route (feeinsufficient)

after doing some research it seems that there is a bug that has to do with the fees and makes lnd and c-lightning incompatible right now, or atleast the blockstream node with how its configured ( i could be very wrong on this)

https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/669

https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/443

https://github.com/cdecker/lightning-integration/issues/11


so i moved on to eclair... eclair looks really nice. getting it running on mainnet wasnt that hard once you actually find what you need to change... at least it looks like its running fine on mainnet, compiled fine and says mainnet bottom right now. maybe i missed something... but now that its running, i cant seem to open any channels to any nodes at all.

all i ever get is ""connection failed""... in the log i see a bit more, but still not sure whats going on:

ERROR fr.acinq.eclair.gui.Handlers   - Could not open channel akka.pattern.AskTimeoutException: Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://default/user/$i#-881407763]] after [30000 ms]. Sender[null] sent message of type ""fr.acinq.eclair.io.Peer$OpenChannel"". at akka.pattern.PromiseActorRef$$anonfun$1.apply$mcV$sp(AskSupport.scala:604)


c-lightning just straight up says ""c-lightning currently only works on Linux (and possibly Mac OS with some tweaking)""... 


soooooo my am I just too stupid... or is it really currently not possible to buy those damn sticker using a windows bitcoin full node with lnd and/or eclair?

do i really have to use c-lightning? is there really no way to install c-lightning on windows?

has anyone done it on linux LND or eclair?

has anybody here successfully bought a sticker or a t-shirt from the mainnet lightning store using a windows lightning node? id be very interested to know how you did it.

Scammed for 3.5 bitcoins. Any help?,"Hello

This is my very first post here on Reddit and it’s not how I wanted to start.

Short story: I’m not really into all this crypto market, not a specialist, not my zone but in 2016 I’ve bought 10 bitcoins just to give it a try. 
Last week I’ve still owned those bitcoins but decided to exchange some of them into cash. I’ve found a facebook page called “Crypto Exchange” with a pretty huge amount of likes and posts. They were offering some great deals compared to the market value of the btc from at the moment, I was getting like $300-$400 extra for each bitcoin and I’ve decided to give it a try. 
I was thinking to sell 5 of my 10 bitcoins but after that as I wasn’t too confident I wanted to try their service so decided to sell just 3.5 of them.

They’ve told me that I will get my payment via bank transfer and they will send me the payment confirmation and after that I will have to transfer them the bitcoins. This is where I got pretty confident, thinking I won’t risk anything because I am not going to send them the bitcoins without the confirmation.

After I got the payment confirmation, I’ve sent them the bitcoins and now all I had to do was wait until the money got into my account. But that never happened...And after 3 days I’ve started to search and ask questions and discovered that the payment confirmation was fake and I’ve been scammed. Ofc they’ve blocked me everywhere after I’ve tried to ask them what is all about.

The question is: Is there something I can do to get my bitcoins back? Is someone able to do something about this as they were not stolen from my account? ",1519511890,24/02/2018 22:38:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8005en/scammed_for_35_bitcoins_any_help/,0

Follow up about car purchase (obviously good idea),"[Bitcoin ATM Receipt for the sell]( https://i.imgur.com/QZSNz8K.jpg/)

If anyone remembers that day, transaction fees skyrocketed over $100 and coinbase went down. I had no choice but to use the Bitcoin ATM in Sandy which charges a 10% fee (BTC was actually at $16.5k)

Previous thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7k9f6r/should_i_buy_a_car_please_help/

Couple months ago I asked if I should sell some Bitcoin to buy a car. At that time, I (probably along with many of you) was under the impression bitcoin might have been upwards of $40k by now, so I was wondering if it was worth spending it.

I live in a city with decent bus system, but taking the bus still turns a 20 minute car drive into a 1.6 hour bus trip.

I ended up buying a '99 Subaru with 210k miles for $700. After some OBD-II trickery to get it passed emissions (knock sensor CEL), and tail-light replacement to pass safety inspection, I'm finally driving again!

Cost to get running:  
$700 purchase price  
$20 OBD-II reader  
$30 emissions inspection  
$15 safety inspection  
$27 oil change  
$6 tail light  
$86 registration fees  
$30~ gas  
Total: ₿0.0553 Bitcoin  

Value at the time: $914 (I sold at $16.5k)  
Value today: $526 (BTC now at $9.5k)

Actual investment: Cloudmining with free Google Cloud trial  
(Since their motto changed from ""Don't Be Evil"" to ""Do The Right Thing"", I believed this was the right thing to do. Google makes like $18k profit per minute....)
  
  
  
...I just want to say that having a car has improved my quality of life *dramatically*! Best way to describe the feeling is that I feel human again.

The amount of time I've saved by having a car has been *well worth* the cost of selling.

So I guess the point of this post is, to all you ""HODLers"":  
If you don't have a car but own enough BTC to buy one... maybe you should sell, so you can buy yourself an extra 2.5 hours a day that could be put to something better than riding the bus.

FUCK riding the bus, I'm in my late 20s.",1519513859,24/02/2018 23:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/800d0b/follow_up_about_car_purchase_obviously_good_idea/,38

is that, blocks are being mined way faster, in about every 4 minutes, there is a block mined, how come the difficulty is not being increased to stop it from being mined so fast?",1519539039,25/02/2018 06:10:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/802qgp/bitcoin_blocks_being_mined_too_fast/,0

Security vulnerability when claiming multiple forks,"Consider this not so hypothetical situation.

Suppose you HODL'ed your BTC for a medium to long time, during which 10-20 forks happened. Most of those were shitcoins, died and are worth nothing, but 3 or 4 of them together might hold real value e.g. a couple thousand bucks in your portfolio. So you decide to claim those forked coins. Conventional advice seems to be to empty out your Ledger before extracting the private key and presumably supplying said key to the software wallet supplied by the forker, so there is ""nothing to steal"" from the empty Ledger in event of a scammer forker misusing your private key. *But therein lies the vulnerability: you can't claim 4 forks simultaneously.*

&amp;nbsp;

Best process I can envision is this:

1) Empty the Ledger onto a new Ledger or some other hardware wallet with different private key.
 
&amp;nbsp;

2) Extract private key from Ledger with tool of choice (latest Reddit threads might tell you which is best).
 
&amp;nbsp;

3a) Install wallet and fully sync blockchain for fork 1 but do not yet supply the Ledger private key. Prepare a new wallet for fork 1 that has its own new private key. Call this wallet f1destination. Save the wallet.dat and put the receive address in a text file.

3b) Install wallet and fully sync blockchain for fork 2 but do not yet supply the Ledger private key. Prepare a new wallet for fork 2 that has its own new private key. Call this wallet f2destination. Save the wallet.dat and put the receive address in a text file.
 
3c) Install wallet and fully sync blockchain for fork 3 but do not yet supply the Ledger private key. Prepare a new wallet for fork 3 that has its own new private key. Call this wallet f3destination. Save the wallet.dat and put the receive address in a text file.

3d) Install wallet and fully sync blockchain for fork 4 but do not yet supply the Ledger private key. Prepare a new wallet for fork 4 that has its own new private key. Call this wallet f4destination. Save the wallet.dat and put the receive address in a text file.

&amp;nbsp;

4) Drink a big cup of coffee and make sure you are really awake.
 
&amp;nbsp;

5a) Supply Ledger private key to create the wallet on fork 1 that has your forked coins.

**[VULNERABILITY OPEN-someone has your private key and your wallet is not yet empty.]**

Immediately send forked coins to f1destination.

5b) Supply Ledger private key to create the wallet on fork 2 that has your forked coins. Immediately send forked coins to f2destination.

5c) Supply Ledger private key to create the wallet on fork 3 that has your forked coins. Immediately send forked coins to f3destination.

5d) Supply Ledger private key to create the wallet on fork 4 that has your forked coins. Immediately send forked coins to f4destination.

**[VULNERABILITY CLOSED-your old Ledger wallet is now truly empty.]**
 
&amp;nbsp;

*The security vulnerability seems to begin at step 5a, and last through step 5d.* After 5a, the software wallet for fork 1 has your Ledger private key. If they are fast enough, or perhaps had written malware to do this instantly, they could execute steps 5b-5d (plus every other fork that ever happened) themselves and claim all your other forked coins off your Ledger private key before you claimed them.

Is this a hypothetical scenario? Not really. I’ve only owned BTC since Nov 2017 and I already have many unclaimed forks. Most are just a couple hundred bucks total, but a couple are worth a couple to several thousand dollars, which is what got me thinking.

Alternative: Should we instead be moving all our BTC in and out of a core software wallet just before/after every single fork? Not in my opinion, too risky something goes wrong and you lose your BTC, just to collect a couple hundred bucks of shitcoin most forks. But over time, it seems a couple of those forks do have value.

This is all moot if Ledger offers a spit tool, but I would not assume or expect of them that they will for every single fork even if it’s worth a couple grand to your portfolio. The biggest forks I would hope they would eventually have a tool for though.

I suppose to try to be safe, we can use only open source wallets wherein code has been verified. Is that 100% secure, or could a malicious fork author still somehow access your private key outside their desktop application even if source code was verified?

Any other solutions more secure than what I suggested?

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:** there appears to be a security vulnerability when claiming multiple forks that begins after supplying your private key to the first unclaimed fork’s software wallet, and lasting until you have claimed all your forks and sent them to new wallets. Any way to close this hole?

The problem with dissapearing Bitcoins,"So a thought crossed my mind earlier today and have done so at many times previously aswell.

As we all know and maybe alot of us has experienced, losing Bitcoins into the abyss is not really uncommon and it's something that really hurts you. It's estimated that around 4 million Bitcoins (idk if this number is correct) are lost forever.

So my question is, is there a possible solution to this problem or will all Bitcoins eventually disappear because people type in invalid addresses etc.

And what would a solution to this look like?

* Coins that are sent to an invalid address are sent back to the sending address
* Coins that are sent to an invalid address are sent into the ""mining reward pool"" (not sure this is even remotely possible)
* They dissapear forever and we just have to live with it

I don't have alot of knowledge of exactly how Bitcoin works in the backend so I'm not sure what kind of solutions (if any) are possible.",1519557381,25/02/2018 11:16:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/803w9g/the_problem_with_dissapearing_bitcoins/,0

Free power. Should I mine?,"I have access to free power. During the day I have a 4kW solar power system. Of course the sun doesn't shine every day, of course I don't always have 1.3kW free to power an antminer S9 but generally speaking at least 50% of my power during the year is free I worked out. 

Should I mine? I'm thinking of getting an antminer s9. If I run the numbers through the cryptocompare calculator it says I should expect the s9 to make around about $6 a day at the moment. And that factors in the cost of the power too which could be free or very reduced. 

I know it can go up and down, and difficulty increases etc but I wonder if anyone else is doing this already and has any advice / can tell me if they made a profit etc... ",1519559747,25/02/2018 11:55:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8041it/free_power_should_i_mine/,13

"Have great idea, Need partners with know how","I have had an idea for many years that we could create an exercise machine that would generate power that could be stored, used or traded. I’ve spoke to a few people who told me it was not practical.

But lately I came up with an idea, what if the exercise machine activated a specific miner that mined token (health tokens) what could health tokens be used for and how would they help humanity?

1. People would be more likely to exercise if the tokens had value to them.
2. The fact that they are exercising could lead to health insurance discounts.

I could also picture a franchise of gyms that let their members use these tokens for services, memberships, supplements and other products.

I could also see these machines used as employment for people, sort of like Uber anyone would be able to do it in there spare time.

The exercise machine would have to be
Made where it requires you register and the
Machine can identify you and
Your wallet. The Blockchain or
Algorithm would need to be proprietary to a specific miner that could
Only be powered with the exercise machine.

Advice for Securing Private Segwit Keys needed,"I finally found the time to move my BTC to Segwit addresses before doing so I wanted to clarify some security concerns. I know there are many disucssions about this issue. Still I have some questions.

My general strategy is to generate keys only on a linux live system that runs in memory of a machine with no internet connection.

First rule is for me to remember my private keys. In my head they can't be stolen. however they can easily be lost once I am sick or once I die. There is obviously also the possibility that I just forget the key. 

Therefor my second strategy is to have some backup of an encrypted version of the key. So I use BIP38 to encrypt my keys with an extremly long passphrase and have some paper printouts of the encrypted keys which I can distribute to several geographically seperated locations. As far as I understand I could even post these printouts here on reddit since they cannot possibly be bruteforced once the passphrase is long enough (which it is)

Just to make sure: When importing the private keys to electrum in this clean linux live system. I can also encrypt the electrum wallet file. which can also be stored on a hard disk and is extremly useless for people without my passphrase. This enables me to even store the keys on a remote server or if I decide to trust Google/Dropbox whomever...I could also post the text of the encrypted wallet file here on reddit as a backup.
The idea: The likelihood for the data to be lost will be very small.

However the same problem arises: Without me and the information of the passphrase the private Keys cannot be decrypted. 

So what methods do u use to protect your passphrase or share it with trusted family members and so on...?

I know multisig wallets could resolv the problem but in this case I would have to trust several people not to come together and steal my funds. Also I would have to trust them to keep their privat keys very save or be able to pass the private keys on to people in case they are sick or die. The problem is that the people I trust most are not particular tech savvey. (rather the opposite)

Asking these questions and describing the problems I even have the shocking feeling that spreading bitcoins on multiple exchanges might be even more secure :(

Prediction for the Future,"I recently traveled abroad and noticed that many banks allow you to hold funds which contain both the foreign currency as well as the US dollars. I asked the teller the reasoning and she mentioned it was cause people trusted the US dollar.

I believe in the next 5 years small private banks will allow you to buy/selll cryptocurrency for a fee and will take on the responsibility of securing the private keys as well as insuring the funds for a monthly charge. 

In 10 years the larger banks will see this as a good way to make additional revenue as well and will allow for. At this point companies like visa will also begin to accept crypto for purchases.

Please keep in mind banks are in a business to make money. If crypto is the next currency they will want evolve to keep their customer base. Also i know a lot of folks push that you should own the private key. I'll be honest I dont know if i would really trust myself to hold a key with tens of thousands of dollars that if someone got a hold of they would have access to all my funds and it's not recoverable.

 I know this is contrary to the belief of the community but i figured i'd put it out there.

Set Up Lightning Node for My Business,"I own a merchant processing company. I am a 100% believer in Bitcoin and want to start offering Bitcoin acceptance to all of my merchants (1000+). I am in a fairly unique position to start a business specifically focused on Bitcoin adoption.

Can somebody point me to a guide in setting up a mainnet lightning node? I know its not ready yet and its a use at your own risk situation which is fine. Worst case scenario I will take the hit for my customers and help in discovering bugs in the software. I plan to use an API, which im sure Coinbase offers, to automatically sell Bitcoin once received so I can deposit to my customers accounts with their credit card receivables. 

Any help would be appreciated.

"Trying to keep myself away from FOMO-ing into every bull trap, maybe helpful for others","Sup,

after FOMO-ing into some recent bull traps repeatedly in January I started to gather information all around the crypto scene and built some tools out of it.

First of all, I started to conduct weekly surveys on StrawPoll for an overall sentiment of crypto investors. The idea behind those polls was that when everybody is bullish on Bitcoin and expects the market to rise, most of the participants are already invested and there is less money available to bring the price to a new level (of course a number of around 1,000-2,000 voters is marginal compared to the whole market participants, but I'm expecting to grow these numbers). On the other hand, if people expect the market be bearish, I'm concluding that many people are waiting on the sidelines to find a perfect timing to enter the market again. Thus, the market has potential to do the opposite and will rise again.

In addition to that, I'm crunching the usual Reddit/Twitter Sentiment numbers about positive/negative headlines into a ""Fear"" or ""Greed"" influence by the news or media sites.

Also, panic-selling drops or FOMO-caused jumps will be analyzed and added to the formula.

An example image of the outcome of my calculations on imgur is here: https://i.imgur.com/OcAps8a.png

All in all, it helps me to stop placing random buy orders in bullish trends just to be disappointed about the next drop. I'm happy to hear some of your ideas for enhancements or tips to make it even better. Cheers!

**TL;DR:** All information I'm gathering is resulting in a Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index (https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). Details below.",1519584447,25/02/2018 18:47:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/806gwu/trying_to_keep_myself_away_from_fomoing_into/,62

Idea for adoption with hurdles of idea included.,"No one wants to spend a volatile asset because ""Oh no, the x BTC is just bought coffee with 2x and now I could've bought two if I had waited!"". My solution, let's say a coffee is 1 BTC for $1 simplicity's sake, the coffee is also a dollar (what a nice world this is). A customer pays 1 BTC for a $1 coffee, yay. Now the price is 1 BTC = $2. I would say why not let a customer open an account with that store. They pay 1 BTC and if the price goes up, the store holds that BTC and allows you to now have a free coffee considering the 1 BTC you paid is now worth $2.

* What this allows is for someone to not only want to invest BTC or a coin of their choosing that is solid and will either not absolutely tank in price, stay stable or increase in value. The store will keep it all in wallets. The store keeps the coin so regardless the store makes profit, either the customer never returns and the coin goes up in value or the customer returns to give business because they have a balance there of money that the store has earned regardless.

* Fees: so let's say for whatever reason fees become high again, customers can either pay the fees themselves and be invited to a some kind of reward system (you get a muffin or something after so much fees have been paid) or leave it to the store to pay and pay a slight premium on their purchase enough for the store to make a profit for paying the fee. So if fees are high, people will likely just pay them and take a muffin rather than pay even more for the premium on the purchase (kind of extortion but they can also use fiat if they really really want to).

* The problem is what if the price tanks, do the customers now owe the shop? No, up to maybe a 5-10% loss max you could charge a 5-10% premium on the coffee ($.1) to make up the loss should you wish to use a crypto to pay. Likely they can fall back on fiat here if they are a regular. If they are a new customer then their coffee will be 1.1BTC instead and a new wallet will be generated for use with that store.

* This would work great at bars/restaurants/shops/grocery stores that people frequent often and in reality cost them really no more or no less than fiat but with a potential for your $1 BTC purchase to get you possibly two coffees, you're almost investing in that shop and crypto at the same time.

* So what if a shop accepts a coin that tanks 80%. Well, that's the risk they have to take for innovative tech and potential of high gains. Imagine if this was implemented in 2013 for example. Coffee shops would be conglomerates by now. (think of the pizza or whatever). You would also have free pizza there until the end of time.

* Second problem is taxation because I have no idea how something like might be taxed in this situation.

* Third problem is maybe crypto really is a bubble or gets taken down by some factor some day in some way (not fudding) and it takes down all the stores into oblivion with it, crashing the economy globally.

Other than that what do you think? It could be great for companies starting up.

I have MFA turned on, so if someone had hacked my password, there was still the requirement to verify the transaction via email, and also respond to a text message.....which means this was not a simple case of a hacker finding my password. 

I have reached out to the company, but no response. I am also contacting the local news station here in San Francisco....perhaps they can help with getting the company to respond....who knows.

"Bitcoin, some question from a starter miner","Hello,

I've heard alot of discussion on bitcoins, and conclusions are always the same; the cost of energy is equal or higher of ASICs miners earnings or increasing difficult overtime or bitcoins value is going to fall or large farms will ruin private miners.

All this things didn't encourage me about to start with bitcoins.

Recently I've found a way to have an almost free energy (very low cost), a little budget (not above 500$ , just becouse I'm not an expert to invest more) and some space without heating or noise problem, 24h operating. Also I don't have problems to setup all the things.

For me, seems a good situation to start with bitcoins to learn something, to have fun and to earn something. Earn for me is intended as: recover my money's spent on miner, have a little or funny earning between 50-300$ monthly, not to live or become rich with that but to explain spent time with bitcoins.

So, my first newby question is. Is this possible? Aren't bitcoins money that all the people try to earn or, at least, not loose their money?

Going deeply, in my situation I need to evercome some dubpt.
As I said I don't have energy problem, so what remain is HW choice and Bitcoins speculation questions.

What I'm looking is a compact solution, ASICs all in board, low cost, low energy efficency to keep price lower, higher computation/price that I can get. How do you advice me to proceed? Any model to advice?

About returns, I've tried some calculators. Most of them says me 4TH -&gt;50/80$ monthly. Seems good, about 10 month and I'll start to earn something. But what worry me are calculators that says me 50$ now, 5$ in 10 month. This means for me that despite no energy cost, it's impossible to recover moneys.

This made me think:
- All this miners, are mining for an ideology or for earning?
- If they want to earn, how they can do that with the need of costantly change HW to overcome increasing difficult?
- With need of bigger and bigger farms, energy must have lower and lower cost, but there will be a point (very near in time) where there will be no income. Miners (and farms) how they will overcome this problem?
- if the answer to previous questions is: Speculation on Bitcoin price. What I've saw is a big rise on price, stabilization and some drops, something like: I was luky at start and earned a lot with speculation, all the people that comes after me should work a lot to earn. My question is, mine without look at speculation, is enough to earn or a miner should always hope in Bitcoin price rise? 

Of course i'm a newby with newby questions, maybe I didn't considered some crucial aspects. I ask you to kindly explain me with patience.

Thanks everyone for your answers.",1519599792,25/02/2018 23:03:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8089rd/bitcoin_some_question_from_a_starter_miner/,0

Lightning fill-up service without touching the blockchain?,"I was worrying about the scalability of the blockchain once Lightning is released.

But then I realized that there could be lightning fill-up services. A website that starts up a node with let’s say 1k btc. A substantial sum. The web site could then sell btc via lightning without touching the block chain until they them selves need to refill.

In the case of Amazon they could sell fill-ups and use btc that they themselves rake in from selling stuff.

I’m not worried about this being dangerous centralization because they are making things a bit cheaper and fill-ups 10 minutes faster.

Thoughts?

I'm happy Bitcoin is growing and these options are now here.

CEX.IO stole my 5500USD.(DAY 36),"I was aware that there are many victims who claim that CEX.IO is SCAM.
## I thought they are weird people because I was fine using CEX.IO.
I never thought this kind of SCAM would happen to me. ##

They randomly pick the victim and steal money.
please, be aware that you might be a victim of their SCAM, too.


I have had really really hard time to get answer from CEX.IO that they would refund my money.
(you can't even imagine. It has been nearly a month.) 
They said they wired my money back not providing ANY KIND OF PROOF(receipt, MT-103, etc.)

Feb 16, CEX.IO said, ""Your funds should have reached your bank account.""


and It is Feb. 26... Still no money.
My bank said there must be some problem.
But CEX.IO has no intention to find the money's whereabout.  CEX.IO just keep on say ""WE SENT MONEY""


They refused to provide any proof of transaction saying absurd words
""We are working with finance partner who has its worldwide payment service providers and banks. The bank from which you should receive the funds is one of the partner's bank. We would kindly ask you do not worry and be sure that the funds should be available on your bank account in a short time.""


what the hack?
Is that the reason why they don't provide the proof??

CEX.IO says ""go to your bank, ask about the money""

I don't even know where the money coming from.

Part of CEX.IO or whole exchange is involved in this SCAM.
I think they sent money to somewhere else and take it.
They are stealling money from users.

## I found multiple victims who got stolen their money in the exactly same trick. ##


Here's Mark Titcombe for example.
------------------------------------------------------------
CEX.IO I deposited money with you last year and after you asking me for an MT-103 form that my bank says isn't necessary, weeks of ignored questions and only repeated auto email response I said to just give me my money back if you can't deposit and be a trading platform. 

You said you sent money to me 4th Jan. 36 working days ago. No requested proof that you sent it has been provided. I know I'm not the only one. 

Have messaged you repeatedly on twitter/email and your emporer Oleksandr Lutskevych my ticket number. I don't really want to have to dispatch a debt collection agency to your registered London addresses, I just want my money back by end of working hours (UK time) 28/02/2018: 

32 Threadneedle street EC2R 8AY
2, 1-5 Clarkenwell Road EC1M 5PA
20 Discovery Dock apartments, South Quay Sq, E14 9RT

Assuming these properties aren't empty fronts and you are an actual legitimate company, you should be embarrassed that I am having to take this course of action.

PLEASE, DON'T BE A VICTIM OF THIS SCAM EXCHANGE.

"Congrats Bitcoin, performance level up!","I am happy to see that things are finally coming to fruition. It seems like forever ago SegWit was voiced as the peoples choice but it has taken too long for the big players to adopt (I'm looking at you Coinbase). If you watch the in/outs you'll notice a good portion of the tx's are starting with 3 :) The Mempool is near empty, fees are ridiculously low, confirmation times are in the realm of reality (e.g. if you were in a shop buying something with BTC). Both the dev and live lightning network have grown exponentially as well, I believe that is because the people are hungry for a solution that allows BTC to shine. While it might take a while for the lightning network to be fully debugged and adopted, it feels like we are almost there.

Bitcoin is priming... boys, we're not going to the moon, we're going to Andromeda.

Bitcoin will one day consume 90% of the world's electricity,"Bitcoin PoW energy consumption is NOT a waste. I see a lot of people showing that bitcoin electricity consumption is small, smaller than gold mining or fiat production, but this is only hiding the truth.

Bitcoin will one day consume 90% of the world's electricity.

Current miners rewards is roughly 2,160 BTC per day or $20 million, let's consider that half of that is used to pay for electricity bills. When 1 bitcoin is $1 million that would be $2 billion, 20% of current world electricity consumption!
Mining farms would be common sight, every semiconductor manufacturer would be making bitcoin ASIC chips and almost all of the world silicon production would be used by it. None of that would be a waste.

Half of the issue is to define waste. When I take the plane to go on vacation am I wasting kerosene? Is watching TV a waste? Is the production of meat? What about producing and selling iPhones?
The second half is the way we produce electricity, relying heavily on fossil fuels. Bitcoin will create an gigantic market for clean energy, and we will all enjoy it in our daily lives.

We could imagine in the future a fork of bitcoin to reduce the base reward to 1 BTC per block, maybe even removing it completely to rely on transaction fees alone. It would be an interesting trade-off on security.
It will most likely happen at some point. In the end, the market will decide and I will watch with a lot of interest.

The production of financial freedom is not a waste. We, the users, will benefit greatly from it. We should be cheering the growth of mining.

$10 Billion Lawsuit Filed Against Craig Wright Over Stolen Bitcoin,"Dave Kleiman’s estate just filed a claim against Craig Wright.  The lawsuit was filed by Boies Schiller Flexner lawyers Devin ""Velvel"" Freedman (https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/velvel-devin-freedman.html) and Kyle Roche (https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/kyle-roche.html).  It claims that shortly after Dave' death, Craig employed an elaborate scheme to steal between 550K and 1.1M bitcoins and other intellectual property owned by W&amp;K Info Defense Research LLC - a Florida company Dave owned.
 
The complaint publishes documents evidencing a long history between Craig and Dave, including documents demonstrating their early involvement in Bitcoin mining. Interestingly, while the complaint discusses Craig’s claim to be Satoshi, it seems to really focus on evidence Craig and Dave mined bitcoin – as Satoshi’s identity is irrelevant to whether Craig stole from Dave.
 
Craig’s twitter silence is deafening...

Basically my thought is too get how much people are talking about cryptos on:

* Google searches
* Twitter searches/tweets
* Facebook searches/posts
* Open to suggestions

And then every day compile of all the trending stats, do some graphs, comparisons to other days and maybe see if they have a correlation to price. Then all this data can be sent out to people via email every day. 

Open to all suggestions to make it better or feel free to let me know you wouldn't use it!

Tax cost basis for coin transfers for an exchange?,"[Edited for clarification]

For Coinbase, when a coin is transferred into the exchange, where does it get the cost basis (for tax reporting)?
I noticed that it does a calculation on the gain/loss based on the market price when it was transferred in. But it is not clear how it gets the 'cost basis'.

Also, for transfer out, it seems to consider this a sale?

Craig S Wright's email to Dave Kleiman is provably false,"In the infamous ""leak"" published by gizmodo and supposedly outing Craig Wright as Satoshi, there is an email that - if true - would be a real bomb.

it is dated march 12th 2008 and it reads:

&gt; I need your help editing a paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin...
&gt; 
&gt; You are always there for me Dave. I want you to be part of it all.
&gt; 
&gt; I cannot release it as me. GMX, Vistomail and Tor. I need your help and I need a version of me to make this work that is better than me.
&gt; 
&gt; Craig

( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/knlyk7dpjqucpmiojhs8.png )

This mail wants to show that the early idea of bitcoin came from Wright to Kleiman, and not the other way around.

Needless to say, it is extremely suspect.

One thing I have found is that not only it is suspect, but it is provably false.

The domain information-defense.com from which this email supposedly originates (the sender is craig.wright@information-defense.com ) was only registered by Wright on jan 23rd 2009, when he registered the Australian company ""Information Defense PTY"". 

BTW, this was just a couple weeks after the blockchain started, and this company is somehow the predecessor of the similarly named American company ""W &amp; K Info Defence Ltd"" controlled by Kleiman and  later passed back to Wright.

The fact is, I believe ""Information Defense PTY"" is indeed related to bitcoin mining, but I think it's pretty likely that Wright forged that email in order to establish a priority over Kleiman.

That domain wasn't his in march 2008.

Gizmodo explains the problem saying:
&gt; pointing to the likelihood that its registration lapsed and was later renewed, which would explain the discrepancy

( https://gizmodo.com/the-mystery-of-craig-wright-and-bitcoin-isnt-solved-yet-1747576675 )

but this just does not hold, in light of an historical whois search 

On Aug 25, 2007 the registrant was a ""John W#####ck, 26 New Lane S####n, NY 11784-3304 US"" and expiry date was 15-Mar-2008. (edited to protect privacy of previous owner)

On may 27th, 2008 the domain was listed in  a list of domains in pending-delete state:
https://web.archive.org/web/20151226101620/http://www.expire.cc/2008/05/27

The domain probably expired, and on Jun 1, 2008 the domain owner was ""eNom, Inc. on behalf of eNom, Inc. Customer TBD eNom Customer TBD eNom Customer (legal@enom.com)""

Enom is a registrar, who had a ""back-ordering"" service for expired domains"" this appears to be an ownership used by Enom for ""domain tasting""  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_tasting )

Only on jan 23rd 2009 the domain was bought by Wright (presumably he got it from eNom) and shortly later archive.org shows a site for the first time:
https://web.archive.org/web/20090216141126/http://information-defense.com:80/

So, I think that email is a provable forgery.

For the skepticals: the historical whois of the domain can be ordered for $49 from domaintools.com . I am not going to publish the report's PDF because its copyright 
status is unclear. 

######  EDIT ######  
Someone is saying ""Wright MAYBE ad access to that address even if the domain wasn't in his name""

Please note that subject of that email: ""Defamation and the diffculties of law on the Internet.""

This subject comes from a thread that was taking place in those days on the ""Security basics"" mailing list, where Wright and Kleiman were interacting

A message from Wright:
http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/144

Kleiman's reply to him:
http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/147
(it's an interesting read, it tells a lot about the relationship between the two)

As you'll notice, in that very thread Wright was using his usual address @bdo.com.au

How likely is it he'd use a different address for an email with the same subject in the very same day?",1519675432,26/02/2018 20:03:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80fzhw/craig_s_wrights_email_to_dave_kleiman_is_provably/,294

Is Crypto a bubble?,"[](https://hmatejx.github.io/crypto_ff/)

Following on the ideas of [others](https://medium.com/@alabs.ken/a-macro-mathematical-model-for-the-observed-value-of-digital-blockchain-networks-23cc8e0dc7ea), I have recently been interested in mathematical modeling and prediction of the social behavior that leads to the forming of bubbles, and the results are quite interesting.

If you follow the link below you will see what I think of the recent situation, and how one can possibly understand it in terms of the underlying social dynamics.

*TL;DR: if you are a seasoned and hardened crypto veteran, you will learn nothing new (apart from maybe some cool math and statistics). Basically, it's all about FOMO, FUD, and weak hands.*

Of course, Betteridge's headlin law applies ;-)

Using bitcoin today reminds me of using dial-up 20 years ago,"20 years ago when I wanted to chat with friends on msn or use Napster, I’d have to make sure my mom wasn’t on the phone and then listen to the tones and gnashing sounds of dial-up while I wait for it to connect. 

Today my phone connects to my WiFi before I walk in the front door. 

Now if I want to make a Bitcoin transaction I have to check the address 10x to make sure it’s correct and then wait for the transaction to confirm. 

I can’t wait to see what bitcoin looks like in 20 years.

Everything is Connected,"I’ve noticed this pattern in which every 20 years we see a revolution followed by a mass adoption phase. Let me explain:

In the 1970s, the PC was in its development phase. In the 1980s, it was in its mass adoption phase.

In the 1990s, the Internet was in its development phase. In the 2000s, it was in its mass adoption phase. 

Now in the 2010s, Blockchain/Cryptocurrency is in its development phase. In the 2020s following the same logic, it should be in its mass adoption phase. 

Notice how each of these three revolutions piggybacks off of the previous one. The internet was built upon the PC and Blockchain is built upon the internet. Yet they are completely different things. Therefore, we should see the fourth revolution start in the 2030s which will “piggyback” off of Blockchain tech. The 2040s shall be the mass adoption phase of the 2030s revolution. Any thoughts? The is just my personal theory/attempt at trying to connect all the dots. ",1519690813,27/02/2018 00:20:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80hz56/everything_is_connected/,39

Best way to transport bitcoins yet be protected from robbery?,"After seeing yet another story about kidnapping and robbery resulting in the theft of Bitcoins, I'm wondering how this latest could have been prevented.  The person was wanting to bring the bitcoins (presumably protected with a hardware wallet or perhaps with 2FA on mobile), but had control of them enough during the robbery to transfer them to the robbers.

As Jameson Lopp states, each successful robbery effectively spawns even more robbery attempts:

- https://twitter.com/lopp/status/961700837654441984

At one time I had seen a strategy of putting your coins into a locked state for a period of time, yet that transaction is a multisig as well which did not have a lock so that if you were robbed (and were not killed) you could return home and double spend the funds using the other key.   Is that approach documented anywhere?  Or are there better approaches?

Do I need to get an attorney?,"Dear Valued Customer,

In December 2016, the Internal Revenue Service issued a summons demanding that Coinbase produce a wide range of records relating to approximately 500,000 Coinbase customers. Coinbase fought this summons in court in an effort to protect its customers, and the industry as a whole, from unwarranted intrusions from the government.

After a long process, the court issued an order that represents a partial, but still significant, victory for Coinbase and its customers: the order requires Coinbase to produce only certain limited categories of information from the accounts of approximately 13,000 customers.

We are writing to let you know that the above-described court order requires us to produce information specific to your account.

If you have concerns about this, we encourage you to seek legal advice from an attorney promptly. Coinbase expects to produce the information covered by the court’s order within 21 days.

For your reference, the court’s judgment can be found here. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 17-cv-01431-JSC.

In addition, we also want you to know that because Coinbase received a summons on December 8, 2016, and more than six months passed before our challenges to the summons were resolved by the court, the period of limitations under sections 6501 and 6531 of the Internal Revenue Code (title 26 of the U.S. Code) were suspended beginning as of June 8, 2017 and continuing through the final resolution of Coinbase’s response to the summons. This may be relevant to the tax returns that you have filed for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 calendar years. If you have questions about your tax liability for those years, we strongly encourage you to consult with your tax advisor.

Regards,

The Coinbase Team",1519699079,27/02/2018 02:37:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80iwpm/do_i_need_to_get_an_attorney/,52

"LN main use case is for exchanges, not everyday transactions?","I’m trying to figure out this question. After looking over the white paper and watching many videos about what it’s going to be “actually” and how it’s going to work it becomes a question of what is it’s main use case? Can it be that LN can’t work for millions of users but can work for a couple of hundred that want to use it for liquidity purposes and trades, in order to have less transactions per Block? It seems to me that this is the only plausible use case. 

And since scalability is bitcoin’s number one issue plus high transaction fees will this really solve the problem long term? It doesn’t seem like it to me. 

Can it solve it, maybe. Will it solve it. Maybe. But it looks like there’s got to be a way to scale when millions of people are transacting with bitcoin daily. ",1519700263,27/02/2018 02:57:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80j1ff/ln_main_use_case_is_for_exchanges_not_everyday/,0

Is Satoshi still alive?,"When Newsweek said Dorian Nakamoto was Satoshi in March of 2014, the p2pfoundaton.ning.com account associated exclusively with Satoshi Nakamoto [came out of retirement](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A52186) just long enough to say that Newsweek got it wrong. 
Two years later when Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi, the Ning account remained quiet. 
First, I find it odd that Wright would risk making the claim knowing how easy it would be for Satoshi to discredit him via a simple post.
Second I find it odder that Satoshi did not in fact discredit him. 
And of course, Satoshi's wallet remains untouched.
It makes me wonder if Satoshi is still alive.

[edit: I meant so include this]
I find Satoshi's silence on Ning also a damning bit of evidence against Wright. A post there would have been better than his ""cryptographic miracle"".",1519701510,27/02/2018 03:18:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80j6he/is_satoshi_still_alive/,3

Legality of Bitcoins in Bangladesh,"According to the Bangladeshi Central Bank's statement, issued September 2017, ""anybody caught using the virtual currency could be jailed under the country's anti-money laundering laws"". Transacting with Bitcoin or any other crypto-currency is punishable by up to twelve years in jail. As to mining it's confusing. Technically speaking, thought, depending on a prosecutor’s own opinion, ""mining"" Bitcoin may or may not be considered as ""using"" it.

Nonetheless, in Bangladesh under the present circumstances, you are better to exercise a certain level of discretion while dealing with crypto in any capacity (as a miner or otherwise). The growing popularity of nationalist, right-wing politics in Bangladesh doesn't leave any hope that this extremist official backlash on the digital economy will be over any time soon.

US tax: Should I amend BTC gain in 2013 and loss in 2014 (net loss = $4000),"Coinbase emailed me that my data will be sent to IRS. I have checked my record in Coinbase. I gained $11000 in 2013. And lost $15000 in 2014. I did not trade afterward. Unfortunately, I did not report these gain and loss in my returns because I was young and stupid. Now it is 2018, which of the following plans is better?

**A**. Wait for IRS to come to me. And show IRS the Coinbase spreadsheet that I actually lose money (lost $4000). So that I don't owe IRS.

**B**. Before IRS found out, I go ahead and amend forms 1040x and Schedule D for 2013 and 2014 to tell IRS that I can claim a net capital loss.

It seems that plan B is better because I can deduct my loss in my 2017 tax. And amending a return before getting caught might avoid some fines and penalties? 

Secondly, can IRS come to me to ask for my capital gain tax in 2013 and evilly pretend that he did not see my loss in 2014? If IRS can do this, I should go with Plan B, right?

Lastly, I have searched and did not see discussions on how to amend capital gain/loss in BTC in the past years. Any insights/experience is appreciated. Many thanks.

Is changing the passphrase sufficient ?,"This might be a noob question but I haven't found an answer to my specific case.
I run a full node Bitcoin Core software (v0.13.1) wallet on my linux laptop. These are the steps I did recently to claim my Bcash:
1) I sent all my BTC to a new online GreenAddress wallet.
2) I exported my wallet.dat file and sent it to my desktop PC that runs Windows 7. I transfered it with Google Drive.
3) On my desktop, I downloaded BitcoinABC full BCH node and put the wallet.dat file in its folder. Then I sent all my BCH to my exchange account, and deleted BitcoinABC.

So my private key have been compromised because both Windows and Google had access to it.
My question is, is it sufficient to use my Bitcoin Core function 'Change passphrase' before I sent my BTC back to this wallet from GreenAddress?
Else, should I delete Bitcoin Core completely and download the full node again for a new wallet ?
Else, should I forget about Bitcoin Core and transfer my BTC to a hard wallet ?",1519717826,27/02/2018 07:50:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80kp9j/is_changing_the_passphrase_sufficient/,1

"Power Consumption in 2140 or, The Proof of Work Paradox.","I haven't followed the bitcoin scene much lately (This may be due to the sick feeling I get in my stomach wishing I had not sold all bitcoin assets about 3 years ago, but I digress.) What do you think about future power consumption if bitcoin were to become a primary currency/complete it's mining period. What are your thoughts on an improvement? What are the benefits to a Proof of Work crypto as opposed to a  Proof of Capacity system, where instead of energy consumption being the ultimate crypto fuel, it's storage availablity. To me this seems simply far superior, so I must be missing something. 

E.C. How could Bitcoin utilize and maintain its sharehold on the crypto market, and transition to a POC model without sacrificing decentralization, or security. ",1519719077,27/02/2018 08:11:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80kt7c/power_consumption_in_2140_or_the_proof_of_work/,1

What Ban? China's Crypto Exchanges Didn't Just Survive – They're Thriving,"https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-crypto-exchanges-didnt-just-survive-theyre-thriving/

It began like this: officials from the People's Bank of China stepped into the offices of the largest crypto exchanges in the country and sat down with their executives.

From the financial regulator's Shanghai and Beijing bureaus, the officials told the exchanges they were interested in identifying whether anti-money laundering and capital control mandates were being met.

But according to Robin Zhu, chief operating officer at Huobi, the regulators had an ulterior motive that January day.

""The regulator wanted to grab a big picture of how significant cryptocurrency trading was in China - how does bitcoin work; where does the money come from; where does it go to; how do people make and lose money?"" Zhu said.

The PBoC also requested information on the exchange's trading volume and user numbers. In addition to the platform's data, Huobi had been regularly submitting information and reports about worldwide government policy in an effort to help the PBoC understand the industry.

Zhu definitely thought something was up. To him, it seemed like the PBoC was gathering information in an order to create a framework for regulating the industry, something many exchanges wouldn't have necessarily been worried about.

But then September came and with it the announcement that the PBoC was banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) and shutting down domestic fiat-to-crypto order book trading.

It seems the inquiries paved the way for the ultimate clampdown, one that severely affected cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.

In a previous interview with CoinDesk, Huobi's founder and CEO Leo Li reported trading volumes followed suit. On November 1, 2017, these figures were just 5 percent of what they were on Sept. 15, the last day before the close of order-book trading.

Yet, not to be deterred, exchanges such as Huobi have continued to thrive, finding new ways to grow their business.

Zhu told CoinDesk:

**""Whatever the policy may be, we will comply with the rules and are here to say. The [bitcoin] trend is irresistible. And down the road it is very likely China will lift its ban on cryptocurrency trading.""**

Israeli Supreme Court supports crypto broker: Issues a Temporary injunction preventing the halt of Bits of Gold's bank transfers,"Israeli Supreme Court issued today a temporary injunction preventing one of Israel's major banks, Leumi, from halting cryptocurrency trading made by Bits of Gold using its Leumi bank account. Essentially the supreme court said that the bank may not refuse to service a company due to the mere fact that its revenue is derived from Bitcoin trading and brokerage.
As Justice Anat Baron wrote ""…The damages that may be caused to the Bank as long as the request is accepted are considered to be speculative at this time. The Bank's decision is based on the assumption that the Company's activity does indeed entail risks that arise in violation of the law, But for the past five years that the account has been operating, these fears have not materialized - as the District Court has determined, according to which the company acted transparently and did not violate any provision of law"".
Youval Rouach, Bits of Gold CEO, said earlier today: ""The court’s decision enables us to focus on the growth of the Israeli crypto currency community. We were the first to request for the creation of rules for digital currency trade and the first to comply with those rules and others. We'll continue to lead this field in order to give crypto currencies their rightful place- as a massive growth engine for the Israeli high tech and fintech industry"".

Why I'll (probably) never buy Bitcoin,"I'm hammering this out during my coffee break so I won't be too thorough, but I wanted to get out some thoughts about Bitcoin that I've been having.

When I first heard about good coins, it was during the early 2014 bubble and I decided to check things out, because the technology seems fascinating to me. I've been following its evolution ever since and dreaming of striking it rich as everyone does. I've seen it being called a Ponzi scheme, scam, money killer, and many other things that seem to further an agenda rather than what the technology is capable of. 

The blockchain has the potential to be game-changing in so many different fields. Bitcoin itself I've been able to use to send money internationally to friends, for purchases, donations, and sometimes just for fun. The idea of money that no one can take from me digitally without strapping me to a chair and beating me with a wrench for the password sounds equally sounds equally revolutionary.

These days, all I hear about Bitcoin comes from the investing side. What percentage of people do you believe look at this as a revolutionary new form of currency, and how many look at it as a way to make a quick buck? In my opinion, there are far too few of the former, and vastly that limit its potential (and gives credit to the accusations of being a Ponzi scheme).

This is why I likely won't be buying Bitcoin in the future until there is a massive shift in the discussion surrounding the technology.",1519740286,27/02/2018 14:04:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80mnet/why_ill_probably_never_buy_bitcoin/,0

New to Bitcoin...,"And I have a couple of questions for you all. 

1. In your opinion what is the safest way to store you bitcoin?

2. Is coinbase a safe and secure way to buy and sell bitcoin?

3. Should I create an external wallet to store my bitcoin or should I continue to use coinbase? If i should create an external wallet where do I go to do such a thing?

4. What is blockchain?

5. What is the lightning network? 

Fairly new to bitcoin and any information would be helpful. Thank you 😊

"Several questions concerning mobiles, android apps, Bitcoin and safety. Any help?","Hi, I always use mobile phone and (almost) never desktop. I connect a hardware wallet to the mobile.

QUESTION 1: Are android mobiles more/less vulnerable to malware/hacking than desktops?

QUESTION 2: Are mobile data safer than wifi? Are data less safe than (desktop) cable connection?

QUESTION 3: Are some mobile brands better than others in terms of avoiding hacking or backdoors? (I've heard FBI warns against Huawei and ZTE)

QUESTION 4: Can a SIM card be ""hacked"" remotely? Is it likely that this happens or can be overlooked?

QUESTION 5: I was thinking on getting a second mobile to be used just for *important* things (bitcoin, hardware wallets, bitcoin exchanges...). It would be one SIM card for both mobiles. The idea is to keep it safe from malware and to be able to have a second channel to check addresses (risk of copy-paste viruses). Is this overkilling?

QUESTION 6: Are apps from Google Playstore reasonably safe? (of course I check a little bit before installing)

Thank you.

"But if to think about it, what interesting things do we know about Bitcoin?","Do you know that in the early years of Bitcoin more than 9 out of 10 financial experts in the world recognized it as an absolutely hopeless means of payment? However, for almost 10 years this cryptocurrency continues not only to improve constantly, but also to beat new records for its value. But if to think about it, what interesting things do we know about Bitcoin? 


* Bitcoin appeared in 2008 and its creator is Satoshi Nakamoto. Interestingly that it is still unknown who is this person, or a group of mysterious experts. The most likely version is that the creator of this cryptocurrency is an American of Japanese origin whose name is Dorian Nakamoto, but actually this option has not received reliable evidence. 


* As you know, the maximum number of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million coins. For today more than half of this number has been produced - the algorithm for the extraction is becoming more and more complex and reduces the total number of created coins every few years. It is believed that the last Bitcoin will be mined only in 2140. 


* The first million of BTC was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto and many experts think that it still belongs to him. Many curious users are trying to find the purses of Nakamoto to get on the trail of its creator, but no-one has managed to do this. 


* Only 36% of all Bitcoin coins was marked in any transactions and payment transactions. All the remaining coins, about 64% of their total number have never been used. Users are likely holding them with the expectation of an even greater increase in BTC cost. 


Of course, these are not all the interesting facts about cryptocurrency and bitcoin! Throughout the history of the existence of this cryptocurrency there was still a huge number of significant and interesting events! And maybe you can add to these facts something interesting?

Help busting the myth of Bitcoin’s energy problem. Recommend sources for paper.,"You most certainly came across the argument of Bitcoin being too inefficient to become a reliable payment system due to the amount of energy it needs compared to credit cards etc. Unfortunately, this view is as persistent as it is uninformed and the scientific community has done relatively little to debunk this myth. This is part of the reason why I’m currently working on a paper comparing the energy consumption of payments using Bitcoin to payment methods like PayPal, Visa, MasterCard or bank transactions. As with any publication, the more sources you can cite the better. Is there any article, video or paper you can recommend? 

Please feel free to post any source you have on the topic of sustainability of Bitcoin. Of course, if you have some figures on how much energy credit card companies or banks waste it will help as well.

Based on various paradigm shifts in how mining is done and how transactions are processed (moving from CPUs to GPUs/ASICs and the introduction of Lightning) I want to try to give a rough estimate of Bitcoin’s future energy needs on a per transaction basis. What are your favorite sites or services tracking the changes of kWh/transaction over time or number of transaction/time in general?

EDIT - I realize that the post sounds quite pro-crypto. Forgive my wording. Please, if you have figures showing centralized payment networks being superior and more efficient then feel free to post them as well. In fact, they are much more valuable since they might include data from sources that were ignored up until now. The goal is to collect  as many sources as possible. That's the best way to get a clear and concise picture of the situation.",1519758255,27/02/2018 19:04:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80p34r/help_busting_the_myth_of_bitcoins_energy_problem/,0

[LN Question]: Open channel with myself for off-chain channel rebalancing,"Let's say I have a LN node, N, and I'm connected to Alice (A) and Bob (B) with two channels.

    A (2)---(1) N (1)---(1) B


In brackets I have the initial channel capacity for each of us. If Alice sends Bob 1 BTC through me, ignoring fees, the final state will be


    A (1)---(2) N (0)---(2) B

My total balance did not change, but my state did as I'm now out of funds on Bob's side. Basically I'm stuck unless I fund the Bob channel on chain again, and so pay the fee.


&amp;nbsp;

**Idea**: *Open a channel with myself to rebalance the channels off chain and for absolutely free. (Basically my own little private channel factory.)*

&amp;nbsp;


To see how that would work I'll break down the above state by writing out the various channels and corresponding addresses explicitly. The initial state is:


    (AddrA, 2)---(AddrN1, 1)   (AddrN2, 1)---(AddrB, 1)


And the final state is

    (AddrA, 1)---(AddrN1, 2)    (AddrN2, 0)---(AddrB, 2)

If I now open a channel with myself, I can reshuffle my balance wherever it's needed. So the network topology would now look like

    AddrA --- AddrN1 --- AddrN2 --- AddrB

And since I'm not charging myself any fees, my total balance will be available to whichever channel requires it, so rebalancing the channels instantly and for free. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**Questions**: 

Does this work? 

If not what would be required to make it work?

How would the multisig ""co-ownership"" of my two channels (Me-Alice, Me-Bob) work with this?

Watch out for Scams,"A friend of mine recently messaged me out of the blue on Instagram, asking me how to buy Bitcoin. Wanting to help out I told them and they said that their Coinbase account was being slow to verify and asking if I could sell them some. In retrospect, not spotting it sooner was foolish of me. I ""sold"" them 0.0317 BTC with the intention of buying it back later as my account on CEX.io is already verified. I sent them the Bitcoin (https://blockchain.info/tx/be2aa72fa87098f3583ab3bd8897f2bf5aabe14cb6611748fda65caad6d05457 for those interested) and all of a sudden I got blocked. Just like that.

Turns out their account was hacked, and now I can't get my coin back :(

All my Bitcoin gone, and thus all my (admittedly small) university savings. All because I instinctively trusted someone. Beware of scams like this.

“Mining” Bitcoin with HQ live. Any other programmers interested?,"The following idea is not intended to be used in actual gameplay as it violates HQ’s terms of service. However, I will point out that accounts using it would likely be at little to no risk of being known :)  

The goal is in theory to passively generate cryptocurrency using HQ Live by using machine learning and a “pool” of accounts. The concept would work as follows:



-A screen feed would be fed into a desktop display from an iphone (simply using a USB connection)

-A program would be designed to detect and scrape text from the screen feed as soon as it detects the question on the screen (tesseract?). 

-A data table would be generated by creating variables such as Wikipedia keyword search counts, google search keyword counts, etc. 

-Using these variables, a model would be trained to answer 3-question trivia questions, and output each answer a confidence score (a simple Machine learning binary classification model should work)

-A reinforcement learning bot (q-learning) would then assess these scores and allocate answers for a pool of accounts (if it is unsure, it could choose different answers on different accounts so that at least some will advance). It would be trained to maximize total payout at the end of the game. Answers would be chosen by the bot at timestamps of randomized variance :)

-at the end of the game, each account that won’s payout would automatically be converted into Bitcoin and divided equally between all accounts that were placed into the machine by sending to their designated wallet. 




Since the game begins daily at the same two times, a timer system could be used to passively run the program at the specified times. Any interest out there? ",1519764672,27/02/2018 20:51:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80pzae/mining_bitcoin_with_hq_live_any_other_programmers/,0

Without any chance to remember at least 5 words from my seed, my 2.8 BTC are lost forever and is even more painful to open Sentinel app and see my BTC there. It was a loss of 10+ x Seat Ibiza :(



Now I know that was not a smart move to keep only a copy of my seed on paper and I want you to keep in mind some tips.
* Make at least 2 copy of your seed.


* Try to make one copy on a steel plate (buy 2 pieces of this tool - trowel with less than 5$ and ask someone to help you to cut it - https://i.imgur.com/PtK9WER.jpg + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNmqx_wdbC0 ). And you can have your CryptoSteel with less than 10$.


* Never keep your seed where your hardwallet is. Not in the same room / building and especially not in the same car.


* If you think that you don't have good locations to hide your seed you can divide your 24 words seed at 3 and make 3 sets of 8 words each (set A, set B, set C). Write on 3 papers: paper 1 = set A + set B. | paper 2 = set B + set C. | paper 3 = set C + set A. Hide each paper in different locations. If you have at least 2 of 3 you have all your seed.


* Do not rely solely on the fact that you can remember all your 12-24 words seed. Without exercising for 1-2 months you can mess 2-3 words and is enought. A piece of paper buried into a jar should be an option.



Don't tell me, as my family, that I'm lucky that I'm alive... I'm not lucky, it was a bad luck to loss all by BTC. Be always careful with your precious because almost every time Bitcoin is lost due to human mistakes. You are your bank. Don't screw it.

"BIP 38 invalid passphrase, need tips! Can't sweep bitcoin","Hi!

Long time lurker here who just made an account for this post. I have been trying to sweep a BIP 38 paper wallet that I have created using bitaddress.org however I get the message invalid passphrase. I have the passphrase written down and the private key on a printed card. I tried scanning the qr code with mycellium and other apps but it does not seem possible to scan BIP 38 codes on iphone so instead I typed the adress into blockchain.info. Blockhain askes for the passphrase but when I type it in I get the invalid message. Now I realize that it is my own fault if I somehow wrote down the wrong passphrase when I created the wallet and that my money might be lost forever. I just wanted some tips if you guys have had similar problems and were able to solve them. Any help would be appreciated since I have half my bitcoin on this wallet. If you need any more info please feel free to ask. Also I'm sorry if my grammar is poor, English is not my first language. 

Thanks!

EDIT: I am a very careful person when dealing with sensitive info so it is safe to say that I checked the private key and passphrase multiple times when creating and writing them down. Though I am not sure that I checked that it was valid afterwards on bitaddress (stupid I know) but I did not know you could do that at the time. 

Also I don't know if it is worth noting but I did print the wallet using a service that seems like they are no longer in business called iirc crypto-cards.com. They were a canadian website I think, maybe something happened to the private key when they made it which is now screwing with me? Anyway they have not stolen the money since I can still see it using the public key. This was around 3 years ago but I made a card before with them that I later sweepd. I had one problem back then with an invalid passphrase but that was because I did not put in the spaces between the words. For this one I have tried with and without spaces and alot of other combinations.",1519767592,27/02/2018 21:39:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80qdi9/bip_38_invalid_passphrase_need_tips_cant_sweep/,0

Ever wondered which benefits blockchain technology could offer for (drinking) water utilities?,"Well, this is exactly what my business master’s thesis research is about.

Based on a literature review and a round of exploratory interviews with 6 helpful blockchain experts, I distilled a list of 12 possible driving forces for the adoption of blockchain technology within the drinking water sector.

To make a future projection about blockchain implementation in this business sector I would like to prioritize these driving forces according to their importance and predictability.

So, if you are proficient on Blockchain technology, please invest 4 minutes of your time in my [little survey] ( https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/K5DQKCS)

FYI, in short, these are the 12 driving forces:

* Technological performance and scalability
* Accessibility of the technology for companies (resources, trialability, customizability…)
* Standardization (technical, terminology, security, privacy…)
* Complexity to understand the technology &amp; recognition of its benefits by potential users
* Development of a comprehensive legal framework
* Legally binding smart contracts (deterministic but also non-deterministic)
* Evolution towards more transparency in public (and private) sector
* Governance models of blockchains
* Development of connected business ecosystems
* Evolution towards (Water) Industry 4.0
* Slowing pace of economic growth (=&gt; need for more efficient business processes)
* Monetization &amp; tokenization of everything

Technical question on LN: does the recipient have to be online to receive a transaction? Or could it work in asynchronously?,"Let's assume there are 3 payments channels


A with B

B with C

C with D

Now A wants to send BTC to D but D is offline. So A could exchange a payment/signatures with B and B could exchange a payment/signatures with C.

C now would just need to wait until D and the transaction could be completed. It could be almost done in an email type  protocol. What am I missing?

Playing devil's advocate: 6 reasons why blockchain technology won't take off,"1) Centralized solutions are cheaper. Consider Amazon vs. Filecoin. Amazon can buy hard drives in bulk and receive large discounts. They can pass those savings onto their customers. The Filecoin users providing storage to customers will have to 1) convince customers that their technology is safe 2) offer cheaper service. There isn't a trust issue with Amazon. So why would customers move to Filecoin?

2) Centralized solutions are much faster. Yes, there is a bunch of work being done now to allow for smaller transactions (lightning networks, plasma). There's no proof this is going to work. High level scaling solutions remain academic.

3) Development takes longer because the software has to operate in a trustless environment. Every update, no matter how minor, requires an independent security audit. There are quite a few examples of why security audits are not optional.

4) Because money is involved forks can be contentious. The default is to do nothing. A centralized solution with a board of directors and CEO can outpace a blockchain community in development speed and time to market.

5) If the private keys are lost or stolen the consumer is screwed. That makes blockchain technology incredibly risky. It's still safer to pay friends with Chase QuickPay. Banks also have insurance. How can a blockchain be insured?

6) Smart contracts are too rigid to replace the legal system. One option is to use an oracle as a source of information. However, using oracles to pull data from outside the blockchain means most of the logic is centralized.",1519772761,27/02/2018 23:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80r2m8/playing_devils_advocate_6_reasons_why_blockchain/,59

Square Cash App will not allow me to transfer to external wallet. Anyone else having issues with this?,"I wish I would have searched for this prior to purchasing bitcoins through this app, but here we are.

I was able to easily purchase the BTC through the app, but in order to be able to transfer it to an external wallet, they require you to ""Activate Withdrawals."" In order to do this, you need to verify your account by scanning the front and back of your photo ID with your phone's camera. Not ideal, but fine, I'm not doing anything shady with the coins so whatever.

I have an LG G6, which has a great camera, and the front of my license scans immediately. But it will not recognize the back of my ID no matter what I try.

I contacted their help (only through email, conveniently no phone number) and to their credit, they did respond. After getting some basic info from me, they had me try everything I already had (uninstall/reinstall app, turn off/on phone, etc.). 

After these things (predictably) did not work, I requested they verify my information a different way. In response, the representative basically said that it's a known issue and they are working on it. And that there is no alternative way to verify the info at this time.

This is infuriating, and unacceptable. They advertised a very specific product (ability to purchase bitcoin and transfer to external wallet quickly and easily), then refused to provide that product without informing users that it was unavailable. 

So currently, my coins are stuck in some bullshit app (with the value in USD fluctuating slightly with constantly updating rates) rather than in a secure external wallet.

Is there anyone else who has had this issue? Any solutions? This is really frustrating.

**I WILL NEVER USE THIS SERVICE AGAIN**

**EDIT:** I have demanded that the original cash I added to the app in order to purchase the bitcoins be refunded. The only ""solution"" they've gave me was to ""sell"" the bitcoins (AKA give them back to them for a loss and get left with money in some bullshit app.

This company/app is bullshit and they fundamentally do not understand bitcoin. I ""purchased"" the coins, but this is not a wallet in the sense that I cannot use the coins to buy/sell or transfer so I don't really ""own"" them. It is infuriating.",1519774653,27/02/2018 23:37:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80razw/square_cash_app_will_not_allow_me_to_transfer_to/,0

My detailed (&amp; honest) review of koral.io,"I've been trading cryptos for some time now.. owned my first couple of Bitcoins back in 2014. Traded super actively for a few years (unfortunately losing some of that initial stash), joined signal groups, private chats/communities (paid &amp; un-paid) etc. While my excitement for the space was booming &amp; I felt special to be in these ""underground"" communities, after some time, I realized most of them were shit. Sure, some were better than others &amp; I connected with some cool people (whales, devs, entrepreneurs). But eventually I got really pissed off because none of them were solving the core issues that existed. These groups could have been super helpful if they didn't just post constant ""TA"" &amp; turn into meme-posting contests. I mean let's be honest, even for the best of us, the market is still 24/7 &amp; a lot of the time we don't know what the fuck we're doing. 

A few months back I was invited to join this new project called koral.io, back when they were still in their closed alpha stage. They branded themselves as a hybrid between a consultancy &amp; no BS community. After talking to the founders on the phone, I was willing to give it a try. They essentially saw all of the issues with private chats, &amp; wanted to gather serious traders who were willing to improve their trading skills. A few months in &amp; I'm still fucking hyped. I literally don't have to use my dozens of shitty FB, telegram, slack, groups anymore because of these guys, they know their cryptos. &amp; honestly it just comes down to how the services are structured &amp; the types of clients they attract. There are actual conferences with the founders every week, which I'm a lot more confident in than trusting @cryptomaster79 or james altucher (curly headed, mad scientist looking dude) who keeps advertising that he's ""the crypto genius."" Anyways, the combo of having koral's team there for me on weekly conferences, when I need them to analyze a coin for me &amp; to have a serious community is just something that I have not experienced before in all my years trading. They actually vet their clients, to keep the dumbasses out. I just wanted to pass my experience along to any serious traders out here, since they hate shilling",1519779575,28/02/2018 00:59:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80rvpd/my_detailed_honest_review_of_koralio/,1

Cointal Exchange is a Fraud - They are being sued,"A few months ago there was a thread on reddit about a Cointal Exchange hack. It has been deleted, and today I found out why. I get news alerts about lawsuits relating to crytpo (I am in the legal field) and I got an alert about Cointal! 

They are being sued by a user who discovered a fraud on the exchange. The lawsuit is found here: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/e79riz057zcx1v0/01%20-%20Complaint%20vs%20Cointal.pdf?dl=0

Also, before that reddit thread got deleted, I was able to pull the links and details that were posted. 

The video explaining the fraud is here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dhbpqwiroz59acp/Cointal%20Full%20Explanation.mp4?dl=0

It seems very likely that the fraud is internal, because there's really no way for a hacker to change the chat like this without having full access to the web site, and if they did have that access, they would just steal everyone's coins and disappear. 

It looks like after seeing this video, the Cointal people (Youssef Azzouzi) started communicating with this user. 

Right after he was confronted with the video, he acknowledged there was a problem, but tried to claim at first it was a hacker (SamB), as can be seen in the Whatsapp chat log.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ghzibb74dxscr0/Conversation%20with%20Yousseff.pdf?dl=0 

However, apparently then he changed his story and claimed it was an internal employee and they are investigating it. They didn't seem to reveal who the employee was. In any case, it is clear from their comments and responses that Cointal is a fraud, or at best a platform that is so compromised and poorly managed as to be completely untrustworthy.

Part 1 (audio): https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0nl9hmkkvcv6fa/New%20Recording%204.m4a?dl=0

Part 2 (audio): https://www.dropbox.com/s/odqdofjfoj56kdx/New%20Recording%205.m4a?dl=0

After this, they apparently agreed to compensate the user for finding the hack/fraud with a security bounty of $500,000. I found the agreement in the filed lawsuit docs as evidence and you can see it here: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/xzfdg57gmdzqqkr/02%20-%20Ex%201%20to%20Complaint%20-%202018%2001%2020%20Signed%20Agreement.pdf?dl=0

I even found a copy of Imad's passport. But I don't think that is supposed to be public record so I don't want to post it here.....in case it's considered ""doxing"" or whatever. 

And it looks from the lawsuit like they made one payment of $50,000 and then stopped, which explains why this user is now suing them. 

It will be interesting to see how this develops. It looks like the stolen funds were traced to Bittrex. It's going to be really amusing if it turns out the Bittrex account holder is in fact Imad or Youssef! 

Im not surprised cus I always thought it was shady aftrer I saw the initial reddit post and how it disappeared. ",1519780957,28/02/2018 01:22:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80s19k/cointal_exchange_is_a_fraud_they_are_being_sued/,10

Entering capital gains for bitcoin sales on Turbotax online seems to be broken - anyone else having this problem?,"I'm trying to report my capital gains on Turbotax online for bitcoin sales from 2017. The top part of the [attached image](https://imgur.com/a/BinN0) shows the first sale as entered in the capital gains/losses section. Cost basis for this purchase was 361.04 and sold for 1770.61, netting 1409.61. The gross proceeds and gain/loss shown in the image are correct. 

However, when I go to the federal review where Turbotax checks your return for errors, I get the error in the bottom part of the picture, saying line 5c should not be greater than the gross sales price. Looking at the worksheet, it is basically flipping the net and gross prices. 

Does anyone have any idea WTF is going on here? The total long-term gain for both this transaction and the sum total of my transactions is exactly correct, so I don't know why Turbotax is not entering the data correctly, apparently, in the worksheet.

Australians - Bitcoin TAX when mined by somebody else??,"Hi all,

I highly doubt anyone has solid information regarding this topic because I understand it's still a heavily grey area. But what may tax implications look like if you have invested bitcoin into a company that will mine for you (bitcoin mining packages etc)? I understand that purchase for profit implies 100% tax so I would assume it would follow the same rules?? There is a ton of info on if you are mining the coin yourself but if somebody else is mining the coin for you? Or would that be considered the same thing?

Do you just look while they make the transfer on their phone and hope it eventually comes through to you? How do you prevent fraud, like (can't think of a better example) someone showing a fake transfer on their phone somehow? Could a spoofing app not be created to make it look like a transfer? 

I assume no one sits there for hours waiting for a transfer to complete..

My Bitcoin got stuck in a wallet? (help),"I say this bitcoin private thing coming up and decided I might as well get some free fork coins to sell them. Saw some statement by Carbonwallet that they would put the forked coins right in the wallet after it happens. I thought that sounded easy enough and decided to test out their site. I sent .036ish bitcoin to test it and it showed up fine. Went to test sending it back to my normal wallet and it charged a minimum .004 fee. More than the amount I'm sending. No options to adjust the miner fee (I know lower will clear). To top it off they encrypt the private key in a way I can't get another wallet to read it. Does anybody know more about whats going on? Am I out $40 for just testing a wallet?

"This gets you 90% upvotes on the other sub: ""For me the most appealing feature of cryptocurrency isn't anonymity, trust, or anything to with high concept principles. It's the potential for saving 3% on almost all my purchases.""","If you agree with that statement, then Bitcoin as described in the original whitepaper is simply not for you at this point. It's a nice side-effect that it can make transactions cheaper than what Paypal or Mastercard currently offers, but it's definitely not its purpose.

Part of me still thinks that this post must be satire. Not that it makes much of a difference, though.

The popularity of this short sighted, ignorant ""what's in it for me?"" position over there explains a lot and effectively makes any attempt to ""heal the community"" completely futile.

Need historical BTC price data per minute of 2017 for the creation of a free taxation tool,"Hi together,

I work on a free taxation tool.
The tool supports many exchanges, reads the csv files and creates a neat Excel file with all your trades, statistics ...
The online tool I used so far did not satisfy my needs, thats why I want to make a simple and clean Excel output.

Does somebody know an API or CSV data, that has the historical BTC price per minute of 2017?
Most APIs only support the last 30 days.
It would be great if there is a free solutions, as I want to keep my tool freeware.

Timing the Bitcoin Market..!!,"I attended a Party, recently, with a gathering of about 300 people and sat in the front row.

A Lady started distributing snacks from the back row and unfortunately, it didn't get to us sitting in the front row.

Another Lady started handing out Drinks, from the front row. But, by then, I had already moved to the Back row. and, so, the drink didn't get to me.

I was irritated and stood up to leave.

But, then, I saw three ladies each with A Big Bowl of vegetable Manchurian dry. This time, I tried to be Wise by sitting in the Middle row. One of the Ladies started the sharing from the Front, and the second Lady started distributing from the back. When they got to the middle row where I was seated, it got over again!

Feeling frustrated, I bent my head, putting my Face in My Hands.

But, then, the third Lady tapped me and held out her Bowl. I stretched out my Hand and guess what was in the Bowl?

Toothpicks!!!

Moral:

Don’t try to Position yourself and time the markets. If you are disciplined and patient, then, good returns will come to you automatically sooner or later.

Otherwise, you will wrongfully position yourself for Toothpicks Only!!!!

How to obtain private key on GDAX.,"Greetings,

I accidentally sent my BTC from Binance to my BCH GDAX address.  I found this on GDAX support:

“What happens if I send Bitcoin Cash to a Bitcoin address?

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash use the same format for their addresses. Any address that is valid on the Bitcoin network is also a valid address on the Bitcoin Cash network. If you send BCH to a BTC address, you will need to obtain the private key for that BTC address and import it into a BCH wallet in order to access the BCH funds stored there.”

My issue is the exact opposite.  Where it says BTC, switch it with BCH.  Where it says BCH, switch it with BTC.

If GDAX says I need a private key, how do I obtain it?  Why would they say to obtain one if that was not possible?

Thanks.

Bitcoin forcing Central Banks to take sides,"This [article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/27/hawk-or-dove-bitcoin-is-forcing-central-banks-to-take-sides) in todays UK Guardian is timely, even if it presents the cursory arguments we have become accustomed.

What I was hoping to read was a mention about whether Central Banks can use bitcoin as an optimal peg by which they can *idealise* their money.

Some may be aware of [Juice](https://medium.com/@rextar4444) and his fearless advocacy of John Nash's Ideal Money. To some, these ideas can appear desolate but bear in mind John Nash was a Nobel economics prize winner and subject of a Hollywood biopic (not an endorsement of Nash's work in itself, but still you hopefully get the idea).

In a nutshell, ideal money is money free from political influence and offers a stable measure by which money and its management can be pegged: so when money is 'ideal', we don't have to worry about it and allows us to socially 'scale'. This dovetails with Szabo's work on trustless technology reducing governance costs.

We know Central Banks are considering such a peg (as outlined in Ideal Money) when they talk about 'blockchaining' SDR's (Special Drawing Rights) but there are too many variances for such a money (SDRs) to be ideal.

The Guardian article mentions to the usual point about bitcoin's energy consumption being 'socially not useful'. It even quotes the Russian Central Bank as saying they will not endorse private money (bitcoin?!) - which just shows how misunderstood this technology is even at the highest levels.",1519817382,28/02/2018 11:29:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80vc2c/bitcoin_forcing_central_banks_to_take_sides/,26

I just got scammed for the first time for BTC. Do I have any legal recourse?,"Please spare me the lectures on using escrow, I'm well aware of mistakes and am just looking for facts that are pertinent to the matter at hand.

&amp;nbsp;

The jist is this: I sent BTC in return for a 65"" TV and custom computer gaming rig (approx. a grand). I never received the item--definitely scammed. We started speaking on reddit, but the majority of our conversation took place on protonmail (for those of you who don't know, protonmail is an encrypted email provider). 

&amp;nbsp;

My question is, is there anything I can do? I assume that if I were able to figure out who this person was in real life that I could sue, but there was no bill of sale and it was over protonmail; so any lawsuit would be was more expensive that the money i lost originally. I also feel as though the police may have the same advice for me: ""sorry pal, you're screwed.""

Thank's for your advice in advance.  I'm only looking for facts on if I can do anything about it or if it would just be a waste of time.",1519825786,28/02/2018 13:49:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80w5q0/i_just_got_scammed_for_the_first_time_for_btc_do/,0

lightning network will kill bitcoin,"lightning was a foolish short term solution. Lets have a reasonable discussion. Lets see if censorship is still rampant on this sub. 

Miners drive bitcoin. The block reward will continue to get lower after each halving. What happens when everybody is using lightning and the reward is low? Satoshis original design was that the fees would be the incentive to mine. So because people wanted lower fees, they decided to change satoshis orignal design because they know better. Thanks for possibly killing bitcoin.

block reward is going to get lower. Reward used to be increased by every transaction. Lightning removes this. Why mine??? You can't assume a price increase will be enough to sustain mining. The fees were supposed to do that. You can say that there will still be transactions on chain, but why would people do that if the fees are lower on lightning? Either way the total portion of fee reward will be lower than if lightning didnt exist.

Trust me I want bitcoin to succeed. But look in the future, after 2 or 3 halvings, everybody using lightning, fees not added to block rewards. I don't see miners continuing to mine if the reward doesn't cover the costs. Unless you think a reduction in security caused by a lower hashrate is a good trade off for lower fees, then we just disagree fundamentally.

Basically I think that people were just crying too much about higher fees and lightning was a short sighted solution that may end up destroying bitcoin. Why go against satoshis vision? You can say lightning is an upgrade, but how do you know? I don't see this as a well thought out plan for scalability. Especially when theres an implication of the destruction of bitcoin. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the basic argument is this.

1. Block rewards are going to get lower
2. As usage increases, the idea was that the fees would supplement miner income.
3. Lightning greatly reduces the fees paid to the network
4. Miners will not continue to mine if they are not making money.
5. Lightning in conjunction with the halvings will greatly reduce the amount of bitcoin miners get.
6. If nobody mines then bitcoin can fail in several ways.

People are assuming that a price increase in bitcoin will be sufficient to incentivize mining. That is already a large assumption. Reducing the addition to the prize for solving a block in the form of fee reduction caused by lightning was a terrible idea. Not to mention the fundamental change to the very foundation of bitcoin as an immutable ledger that records everything.

by the way I am the author of this article so you can't say I hate bitcoin....
http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-question-buy-now-cry-later/

perhaps it is a technological development, but that term has positive connotations, which may not manifest in reality but in actuality effects of the change may in fact effect bitcoin negatively.

I have no desired outcome. I was always against this form of scaling solution. And as a bitcoin holder I was forced to comply with this change against my will. I only hope the people driving this ship have not unknowingly steered us onto the rocks.

you can say I could get an alt coin, but lets be honest bitcoin is where it is at. I am just pointing out that I don't agree that this was a good idea. It's not my fault if the whole thing goes down. Thats why I think this was a short sighted and rushed solution. Did they carefully think about all the possible implications of such a huge change? Were they so arrogant that they thought they could see every outcome? who will be held accountable if it fails due to this change where it otherwise would have been fine without it?

The 2 huge changes being the change in how fees work, and the HUGE issue that it seems nobody is talking about, the fact that it is no longer an immutable ledger which records EVERYTHING, which was the whole original premise of bitcoin itself. It just seems very arrogant that the devs think they know better than satoshi and has the trappings of them wanting to put their ""stamp"" onto this invention. Sort of like how a producer of a show will want to change something so they can say, ""hey look I did that."" to satisfy their own ego. Especially when there were safer scaling solutions that did not fundamentally alter bitcoin in two ways available.",1519826880,28/02/2018 14:08:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80w9xp/lightning_network_will_kill_bitcoin/,0

Do halvenings affect power consumption for bitcoin?,"Hypothetically, let's say BTC stabilized at a given price.

Let's also say hypothetically that scaling solutions are effective, and all tx's clear in a reasonable time for 1 sat/byte (or equivalent weight)

As a halvening event occurs, the reward to mine is decreased (by a bit less than half!)

So, the least efficient miners have pressure to either stop mining, or improve their process.  Some will surely go out of production, the hashrate will decrease, and the difficulty decrease to compensate.

After many such halvenings, will the overall power consumption to mine tx's decrease?",1519828015,28/02/2018 14:26:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80welo/do_halvenings_affect_power_consumption_for_bitcoin/,0

How will the IRS handle this sample transaction data?,"If the IRS receives a list of transactions as follows:

|Date|Type|From|To|Amount|Value on Date|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2013-04-01|Buy|Coinbase|My Coinbase Wallet|1 BTC|$125.00|
|2013-04-03|Transfer|External BTC Address ""A""|My Coinbase Wallet|1 BTC|$130.00|
|2013-04-15|Transfer|My Coinbase Wallet|External BTC Address ""B""|0.5 BTC|$135.00|
|2013-04-19|Sell|My Coinbase Wallet|Coinbase|1.5 BTC|$140.00|

How would I calculate my capital gains?
Does it depend on whether I own addresses ""A"" and ""B""?
And what are the ramifications if the transactions of the coins flowing to ""A"" and ""B"" are undocumented? Is the penalty to pay the maximum possible amount? But that is unclear to me, because if we wait until the value it holds today, the maximum can be in the thousands.

Of course, Coinbase only released amounts &gt; $20k but I kept the numbers small here and data completely hypothetical for practical purposes.

Scammed through LocalBitcoins,"Here's the story of how I got scammed last night, so I put up an advertisement on LocalBitcoins for 250$-670~* @ 10,900$ to sell my bitcoins and some guy sends me a trade request to buy 500$ worth of my bitcoins. I say send me the money through Zelle because It is non-reversible and I thought I couldn't be scammed through it. The guy's IP is from Palestinian Territory, which is a red flag but his verified phone number in United States, so I don't know what to think. He sends me the 500$ and I confirm It on my bank account and then I release my bitcoins through the Escrow program. The next day I wake up and there is a hold of -888,888.88	dollars on my account, my account is basically frozen for 7-10 businesses days because this guy used stolen information to buy 500$ worth of bitcoins from me. I've sent in a support ticket to LocalBitcoins, reported the user for fraud, contacted my bank which said the only thing I could do is file a police report, which seems like It would do nothing. Please let me know If there is anything else I could do about this situation. Thank You.

A serious discussion,"Whether you like it or not Bitcoin will change the world. One of the most obvious ways is the collapse of governmental institutions. But before we get to that point certain things must be accomplished by 'we the people' before that can ever happen. One of the first things that will be necessary is to take back our currency. I am sure the majority of you are well aware of the Ponzi scheme currently passing itself of as the ""Governments,"" so I won't go into that. What I will get into is the need for decentralized mining and why it is important.

Most people think doing it yourself is too hard and not worth it. Wrong. Doing it yourself is not that hard and totally worth it. Currently most believe that the only way to earn bitcoin through mining is with a pool because mining a block is too difficult and it will never be you, but the single bitcoin created from completing a block doesn't mean much because the real value is in the transaction fees leading up to the creation of that block. When a miner processes transactions the miner gets the fees. (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees) Where do you think all the transactions fees go? You earn Bitcoin just by mining.

If we allow mining pools to hold the lion-share of the miners then we are allowing someone else to make choices about our currency, and Bitcoin isn't supposed to be about that. It's supposed to be about decentralization not centralization.

'Decentralized Hedge Funds' Ripe For Volatile Cryptocurrency Market (Forbes),"The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market might seem daunting for individual investors. While some believe Bitcoin to be the next global currency, others remain weary.

For example, the judges on the popular ABC show Shark Tank, Kevin O’Leary and Robert Herjavec, recently sat down with Fortune to share their thoughts on Bitcoin investments. When asked about investing in cryptocurrency, O’Leary mentioned that he is a fan of digital money, but has some reservations.

“When you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin, it will become a global currency, and that’s why I own it,” O’Leary told Fortune.

Many of today’s “traditional crypto” hedge funds focused on trading cryptocurrencies take a number of different individual approaches to ensure profits.

“I trade almost exclusively OTC (over the counter) to minimize risk,” said Arianna Simpson, founder and managing director of the crypto hedge fund Autonomous Partners.

Decentralized hedge funds, however, take a different approach that is based on resource sharing and community profits, made possible through the application of blockchain technology.

“A decentralized hedge fund is a crowd sourced hedge fund, where the fund allocation is selected by the crowd, not a hedge fund manager. Blockchain technology provides trust in a trustless environment and ensures that everyone can participate in the consensus,” said Michael Yuan, Chief Scientist at CyberMiles Foundation. ""Just look at Bitcoin. No one on the network trusts each other, but they all trust the protocol. As a result, they also trust the account balances on the blockchain.”

I'm in dire need of someone's help here. I'm a Journalism BA student at the London Metropolitan University, and I'm looking for someone to interview. Right now I'm creating a small TV-Package for a university TV programme about Bitcoin and how to invest in a safe way. I was wondering if someone here wants to share their story about being scammed, how it happened and what you learned from it. We can conduct the interview through Skype, I can make your voice unrecognisable and you don't have to appear on camera if you want to remain anonymous. It would be a huge help, hopefully together we can help young people invest into the beautiful world of Bitcoin in a safe way.

It is showing as unconfirmed in my Trezor wallet and the status in Kucoin is showing zero confirmations.

I have moved coins around from wallets/exchanges before and have never had anything like this happen.  The transfer was initiated 2 hours before the snapshot - but since it is not confirmed it was a wasted effort.

Any help or guidance would be appreciated.

Can't change tx fee when withdrawing BTC from bittrex?,"I've noticed bittrex charges a non changable fee of 0.001BTC when trying to withdraw any amount of BTC from your wallet. Is that right? They charge THAT much on their withdrawals?
