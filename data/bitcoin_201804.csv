How does Strike (https://strike.acinq.co) work?,"AFAIK, the more bitcoin payments you receive, the more inputs you have to spend from. Having something that batches up your inputs makes a lot of sense.

Ridiculous The Atlantic article asks if It’s unjust that most of Bitcoin’s investors are men,"https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/556190/

From the article:

“Will it be unjust if there is a significant gender imbalance in investor losses or gains?”

Why is the article even asking this question? The answer is NO. Whomever takes the risk should take the gain or loss. So what if men take more risks than women? That is their CHOICE. Why do gender politics need to be injected into everything? If women want to invest they have the same choice and opportunity.

So ridiculous.",1522545096,01/04/2018 01:11:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88n8nn/ridiculous_the_atlantic_article_asks_if_its/,112

Explanation for Bitcoin Price Movements,"Why is the price of Bitcoin alternating between sideways movements and falling?

Think of all the people sitting on shitloads of bitcoins (mined/accumulated from when it was cheap, back when e.g. 1000 bitcoins was just barely worth thinking about). Put yourself in their shoes. If you have a lot of bitcoins, you don't want risk, you're not looking for an ""investment,"" you simply want to turn your bitcoins into (relatively) stable USD as efficiently as possible so you go from being rich on paper to being actually rich.

For these people, selling isn't a matter of clicking ""sell"" on some trading platform because it would totally crash the price. That's the original definition of what a whale is: someone who has so much invested that it's difficult for them to make the trades they want without affecting the market. 

So it's a question of what strategy these people will want to use to get as much value as possible out of their bitcoins. And the answer is: every time it seems like bitcoin stabilizes or climbs a bit, take the opportunity to sell as much as you can. 

End result? What we see now, sideways movements with a gradual, inevitable drop in price. Although when everyone realizes this, it's quite likely the price will completely crash.",1522572939,01/04/2018 08:55:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88pklr/explanation_for_bitcoin_price_movements/,0

r/Bitcoin recap - March 2018,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I’m back with the fifteenth monthly Bitcoin news recap.


For those unfamiliar, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in bitcoin over the past month.


And a lot has happened. It's easy to forget with so much focus on the price. Take a moment and scroll through the list below. You'll find an incredibly eventful month.

- Payments - We accept BTC (and a few others) as well as FIAT.

Of course, would have been awesome if I knew back in December. But oh well- still ahead. What do you guys think, cash out now before it might hit really low or let it ride and not miss out on longtime growth or a big spike?

Who will be the first to blink?,"I suspect that the same big money market manipulators just may be the same ones to set off the new bull market. This theory of mine is based on psychology. Think about it this way:

- they are controlling it due to fear of their legacy systems becoming irrelevant

- there are multiple big money players involved

- they know that they genie is out of the bottle with respect to the crypto revolution and that their ability to manipulate price will only last so long with the finite supply and more normal people becoming enlightened.

All this being as it is they know that the future of finance is crypto and very likely bitcoin being the lions share of the market. With all of these factors considered, it inspires a mental image of the game chicken two cars racing at each other neither side wanting to be the first to turn away.  However inevitably one (or both) will have to or they will all die. Do they really all want to die? Or does someone want to turn away from certain death and embrace (buy) bitcoin and stay relevant in the future of finance?  The choice is theirs.

Crowd-Wisdom Question: How can Bitcoin continue to grow to some huge number when people want to hold whole coins?,"Saw a talk in which Tom Lee, Financial analyst recently said, by the time millenials are finished investing in bitcoin, it'll be 10 Million dollars per coin. I'm not counting on that, but if thats the case it has a great chance of hitting a big number. Realistically how can that happen when on a psychological level, people like holding WHOLE coins? Will all todays bitcoin naysayers all of a sudden say ""I was wrong about bitcoin, now that its $100,000, let me put in $1000""?

Why Bitcoin won't ever become as big as you think it will,"People only turn their assets into currencies because of the stability they provide. That is the only purpose that a currency serves.

Bitcoin is not stable, and never will be, because it is unregulated and largely independent of tangible politics, and its price will always, always, always be susceptible to market movements. That will never change. Stop telling yourself that it'll stabilize at some point. No. It won't. Because it is unregulated, it is doomed to be ruled by market speculators.

So why should people ever trust it? Why would anybody in their right mind put their life savings in a currency which tomorrow could be worth half of what it is worth day? 

Mind you this wouldn't be a problem if Bitcoin was the only currency in the world. In that case, 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin. But other currencies do exist, and the dollar and the euro and the pound and the renminbi are going to be the dominant currencies for the next few centuries at least. So, let me rephrase my statement: Bitcoin won't ever become as big as you think it will .... *in your lifetime*.

"UK HOLDERS: coinfloor.co.uk is increasing its minimum withdrawal amount fiat from £15 to £10,000 TOMORROW. Act quickly, or risk loosing your funds.","This change is happening on extremely short notice.

[https://blog.coinfloor.co.uk/](https://blog.coinfloor.co.uk/)

They are giving users a grace period of 14 days (it was initially 7!) to withdraw all of their fiat from the exchange.

Incredibly, they chose to announce this change via email at 8pm Saturday March 31st -- an Easter weekend. Giving customers less than 2 days notice.

The email itself doesn't even contain the relevant information, instead it had a link to a blog post on the company's website.


Monday April 2nd is also UK public holiday, meaning there are many people who may miss the email, and risk loosing access to their funds.



Suffice to say, I think this is extraordinarily unprofessional, and I am in the process of transferring all of my funds and crypto from the exchange. They clearly want to make their service a place for fund managers and people with high net worth, but I don't know why *anyone* would want to use them if this is how they treat customers.

BTC must get rid of its ups and downs to survive as a currency,"Maybe this has been discussed many times already but I still don't get the point: Given the idea that BTC should work as a currency, why do some of you want it to gain incredible value in very short time, and why do you think it's necessary to hold lots of BTC forever? To me, this seems to be not only two different targets, but also contradictory ones. In the fiat world, you would use a currency with a very precise gut feeling about its value looking at the goods you can buy for it, and you have lots of sources of information to see its (necessarily rather stable) precise value when comparing to other currencies. You would hold it only for the reason of being able to pay something immediately, and to keep your fortune when there is no better option at the moment. Whereas, when you want something which gains value over time, you would use shares, or houses, or rare old cars. Since I appreciate so much the underlying technology of BTC, it would be worth to see it really adopted by the public but it won't, given an average value change of 20 percent per day!

I understand that one of the essential targets of BTC is, that it must never be controlled by any institution. But, and this is what I am really convinced of, you must get rid of the soaring and the crashing, and of the daily 20 percent ups and downs.

The key question is, wouldn't it be possible to get an algorithmic solution for that stability issue?

The BTC community obviously has a lot of super brains. After the brilliant idea of implementing the LN, I think the next big thing you need to tackle is exactly this: get the BTC value stabilized by algorithms. Surely it must gain value over time when the community grows, due to the limited amount of bitcoins, but this process must be steady, foreseeable and without surprises. After you have managed that, I believe you will see lots of people adopt it as a means of payment instead of gambling, and these will then be lots and lots people who are not inside the technology but who are just using it for all the advantages it has. Smartphones are used all the time by billions of people because they are so terribly convenient, but how many of them know all the technology? It doesn't matter to them because it works anyway. I think a technology is mature enough for the really big world when a standard user doesn't need to know anymore how it works. The ""user experience"" of using BTC for payment must just ""it's working always and everywhere"", and the next key success factor is a very reliable stability of its value. 

Unless you want to keep it as something to gamble with, like betting on sports results or dealing with penny stocks. Of course the winners of this game will be at least millionaires at the end, but millionaires in fiat money, and this still ongoing gambling game will not cause any progress on the original idea of crypto currency.

TL;DR
BTC cannot work as a currency when it stays as volatile as it is. BTC brains you need to look for and implement an algorithm which stabilizes the BTC course against fiat money.

Just bought the dip and will put one BTC on look down for my 4 year old daughter and give it to her on her 18th birthday.,"Hey guys!

Long time BTC holder here and pretty new to Reddit.

Sold a small chunk of my portfolio at ATH and made a killing compared to what my initial stake was, and yes should have sold it all at ATH and bought now. If someone has a crystal ball, tell me where I can buy one!

Anyways, I just wanted to share that today I bought BTC for my daughter, from some of my fiat from my “winnings”

I hope BTC becomes what it has the potential to be one day, then it’ll be an awesome start to her adult life. I have to figure out conditions though,  I don’t want her partying it away.

And no, this is not an April fools joke! I’d just like to share our story, me and my wife are pretty exited about it!

PS: I’m not a native English speaker, so pardon if there are any spelling mistakes.


Edit; Lockdown!

I believe that whales are manipulating the market too obtain more bitcoin. In short they are trying to control as much as the supply as they can.Now why would they do this? A lot of the current whales missed that last
Bull run, they know it’s a matter of time until crypto is adopted on a large scale,they ultimately as of now don’t care about the price, the only mission these people have is controlling the market. Unlike fiat currency which has an endless supply, bitcoin doesn’t.They’re essentially getting weak hands to sell to increase their supply for future control. A lot of talk on the dark web, and encrypted chat relay about the “cartel 4”. The cartel 4 is pretty much billionaires who work together in dropping and raising prices.

At this point I need your help: Do you know options where I can buy Bitcoins without credit card or releasing my ID to a company?

Ideas for presentation with bitcoin full node,"I just set up a full node on a raspberry pi3 following these directions: https://www.weusecoins.com/full-bitcoin-node-on-a-raspberry-pi-3-with-or-without-a-pidrive/

While I wait for my node to synchronize with the network, does anyone have any ideas for ways to demonstrate the functionality of the node? I think raspberry pis naturally lend themselves to demystifying computers. Does anyone have an idea of how I can use the raspberry pi to similarly show what is going under the hood of the bitcoin blockchain?

I hope this is a clear question. I'm very much a beginner but I want to make these ideas more accessible. ",1522635648,02/04/2018 02:20:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88w2l8/ideas_for_presentation_with_bitcoin_full_node/,5

Bitcoin security paper resources (for school paper),"Hey all for my network/security lab we were given a project that's fairly loosely interpreted.
 
Your term project should address a research issue in network security, interpreted broadly (it need not be a topic discussed in class). The goal in terms of depth and quality is to develop the effort to a degree that would merit a workshop-caliber publication. 


This could involve the following
1.	Analyze. Undertake a substantive analysis/assessment of security issues for a given network system. For example, to what degree does Skype expose its users to remote compromise? Preserve their privacy? Admit misuse of the system to aid in denial-of-service attacks? Surreptitiously monitor their communications? Have vulerabilities that enable fraud? What is its trust model? What steps could be taken to strength Skype in this regard? What can you say about the expected efficacy of those steps? (Note: it needn't be an application nor involve end systems. You can consider schemes relevant to other layers of the networking stack, or that concern infrastructure/internal components.) 
2.	Measure. Empirically explore and characterize a network security issue. For example, under what circumstances and to what degree do nodes in the Tor anonymizing network alter the content that passes through them? 
3.	Innovate. Devise and analyze (and possibly implement) a new mechanism or technique. For example, this could be a new way to protect servers from application-level denial-of-service attacks, or a new detector for some type of malicious activity. 
4.	Test. Take a result in the literature and undertake a thoughtful and meaningful reproduction of it to assess to what degree you obtain the same results, and why. 
5.	Attack. Develop a new threat. Assess its efficacy, countermeasures/defenses, and likely ""arms race"" evolution. 
6.	Research. Conduct a deep, thoughtful literature survey of a particular area in network security (""research"" as a verb). Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the published results in the area, delimit the boundaries of the state of the art, identify themes and abstractions, frame avenues for future work. 

I'd like to do something regarding the security of bitcoin when left on a open trading site vs private wallet or similar. 

I'm not versed or familiar at all with bitcoin and was hoping some people in here would have resources that would pertain to bitcoin and network security that would be beneficial towards writing this.

The Best Argument Against Anti-Crypto Regulators,"The #1 reason why cryptocurrencies are attacked is because of money laundering, said the boy who cried wolf. 

The BIGGEST money laundering schemes are operated by our own politicians in nearly every country in the world. Money goes missing, money is misspent and so on and so forth. 

We should have a public ledger that is open and transparent so that politicians and their crooked corporate backers cannot evade taxes and spend our hard earned wealth the wrong way. 

This is the silver bullet argument.

The elephant in the room,"Sorry, no pictures of elephants. Just one word: tax.

Everyone who's scratching their eyeballs out over the medium term price movements needs to have a hard think about this complicated and boring, but critical, factor.

The advent of tax regulations for bitcoin from 2017 onward has been a game changer.

Tax was just not an issue for bitcoin users in most major jurisdictions up until 2017, and its unregulated and untaxed status was surely one of its key attractive points from the outset.

Yes, hardcore hodlers in their bunkers gonna hodl and wait for the Fiat Apocalypse. But in the interim years (decades? forever?), aren't law-abiding stores and consumers meant to be ""adopting"" bitcoin as a peer to peer cash system?

From 2017 onward, who in the major countries is going to adopt ""cash"" that's now ""taxable"" just by virtue of using it?

It may be many years until tax regimes in the major jurisdictions become less punitive for users/traders.

Take Japan: currently a bitcoin tax rate of up to 55%, and no offsetting against other losses etc.
The Japanese tax agency issued its rules on bitcoin taxation in December 2017. US and Australian tax seasons are approaching.

Isn't one reasonable medium term price outlook that since December 2017 we've entered a bitcoin tax winter?",1522649676,02/04/2018 06:14:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88xatz/the_elephant_in_the_room/,37

Theory on market trend going downward,"tl;dr: /r/bitcoin is not representative of the actual bitcoin community.  
  
So I'm expecting a lot of downvotes for this but here is my 2 cents:  
  
First-off, I think we should accept that a bubble occurred. The meteoric rise to 20k and subsequent plummet down to current levels should be enough proof to most that a bubble happened.  We know it was a lot of hype driving up the price. As to why 20k was the tipping point and not 100k, it's hard to say, but it's mostly about how steep that upward cuve gets.  When it starts looking like the trunk of a tree as opposed to a mountain, people should expect a bubble...unless, of course, there is a significant external event driving it to that price range. Examples of such an event would be mass adoption by Amazon, Apple, etc...  Once we accept that a bubble happened, it provides for some insight.  
  
The first bit of insight is that bitcoin is prone to hype but hype cannot be forced after a significant bubble. We see people trying and that means the road down from a burst bubble is going to be a shaky decline, not a straight line to the ground. The significance of that is that we see a lot of hopes and dreams get shattered on a daily basis.  It goes down, it comes up a bit and people say ""hey the bull is back"" but then it goes down again.  The trend is still downward to this very day, bitcoin has not yet stabilized at the bottom, and the decline is not over.  The proof of all this is right there in the charts.  
  
The second insight is that as we watch it decline, we see some big surges that go beyond hype factors. Massive buys followed by massive sell-offs.  We call these whales, I believe, and they have been unable or unwilling to use their force to re-direct the market from the downturn. This tells us that whales only have so much power, and most of that power is being used to create a false sense of reality on the bitcoin price for their own profit. Since the bubble burst, every single ""we're back, baby!"" post about a recent surge in price has been wrong.  The price trend is still very much going down.  
  
But back to the tl;dr: This sub is the WORST place to get information on bitcoin that involves market trend or price, this post included.  This is however a good place to get general information, such as emerging new technology and new adopters.  The reason why I say all the posts on price and trend are bad is because this is a typical echo chamber.  The majority of people in this sub are of above average intelligence and technologically inclined and do not represent the masses very well. We can only see logic from our own perspective, not the perspective of the average citizen. While we are able to understand this technology, it is significantly far beyond the capabilities of the average person.  Until bitcoin becomes as easy as handing a dollar to the merchant or swiping a credit card, it will remain a fringe currency, and will NEVER, I repeat, never replace fiat or credit cards.  So all this talk of 1 bitcoin = 1 million dollars is nothing but complete and utter bullshit and the people who make such posts should be banned from the sub for spreading FOMO and trying to manipulate price for their own financial gain. Unfortunately, many of the mods support this theory that everyone holding a bitcoin is going to be a future millionaire once mass adoption takes-off.  But they too live in this echo chamber.  
  
Bitcoin is hard to use.  It's always been hard.  And hard is a relative term because I find PHP programming to be relatively easy, but that's relative.  Bitcoin is no different.  It's easy for techy people but very hard for everyone else. People don't know where to buy from, how to store it, and what merchants are safe to buy from. There is so much fraud in the system right now that everyone is scared of getting ripped-off or having their bank close their accounts.  And to top it off, everyone is scared to spend because they think there is going to be another surge in price soon.  So as a currency, it sucks, it's hard, and that is a good reason for the current trend down. People jumped on the hype bandwagon, saw it sucked, and left.  Deciding to leave a good amount of stress behind.  
  
There is also the issue of bitcoin used for illegal purposes. Let's not lie to ourselves about that. It's been used to launder money, purchase blackmarket goods, and fund illegal activity.  Some people, including myself, speculate that those illicit uses far outweigh the legitimate uses. In such a case, where one is holding onto lots of illegally gained bitcoin, and they don't want to attract a lot of attention, especially now that authorities are taking a closer look, they are going to slowly drain their pool back into the market.  That slow purge is going to cause what we are seeing now: an unbalanced ratio of sellers to buyers. And that too, we can see in the charts.  Thus the slow decline from here on out.  
  
With the increase in government oversight, the people who have been using bitcoin for illicit purposes has been on the decline. They are offloading their holdings and getting out of the game. And they are not going to come back.  The demand we once saw is not going to return unless there is a significant external event.  You see, think of the entire world population, and the small % of which are even capable of understanding bitcoin.  Of that small %, an even smaller % has the extra money and is willing to invest in it. But those investors who got burned buying in at 20k as well as those illicit users who sold-out, represent a group of capable bitcoin investors who will likely never return as buyers. And that's a shame since they represent the majority of people who drove the price up to 20k in the first place.  
  
So what we have is a pool of potential buyers getting smaller, meanwhile the pool of bitcoins created by mining...increasing.  It's a formula for a continuous extended decline.  
  
So /r/bitcoin, and all the hodlers, all the FUD and FOMO people, and everyone else trying to tell you how bitcoin is gonna be, including myself, do not represent the world of bitcoin in how it's actually used. In my case, I do not hold bitcoin, am not looking to buy the dip, but am very curious to see how it all unfolds because I believe the future of currency is digital, crypto, but we have a LOT of growing pains to sort out first.  
  
Good luck to everyone who is currently holding. I hope I'm wrong for your sake.  But I think we're going to see 6k become the new 7k and soon we'll be hanging onto 5k for dear life.  Consider that before you advise others to buy the dip.  ",1522675816,02/04/2018 13:30:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88zar3/theory_on_market_trend_going_downward/,1

Question about bitcoin,"So excuse me if im very bitcoin illiterate, but juat had a question regarding its growing presence as an e-commerce currency. 

I understand that there is a finite amount of bitcoin available in the market. With all the new markets emerging and accepting bitcoin how would it impact price as more and more corporations recieve bitcoin. They could end up holding significant amount of bitcoins which would not reenter the market. 

For example airline companies accepting payment via bitcoin. Its unlikely that thry wouls go to their commercial plane supplier and buy a new plane with bitcoin. So they accumulate more and more bitcoin and this leaves less is the pockets of the everyday consumer to spend. 

This is a small example but if the market grows to where its common place for giant corporations to accept bitcoin this situation would be scaled up exponentially. 

How wouls this impact bitcoin price/availability for consumers? ",1522681859,02/04/2018 15:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8900vr/question_about_bitcoin/,2
5 Pro-Blockchain Bills Passed in Wyoming,"Great summary [HERE](https://soundcloud.com/mindtomatter/ltb-361-the-wyoming-way) on the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast (Well worth the 45 minute listen). Also check out the [Wyoming Blockchain Coalition](http://wyomingblockchain.io/), and their [Telegram group](https://t.me/wyomingblockchain) - a very talented cast behind this coalition. 

Summary of the 5 bills that were passed [HERE](https://www.ethnews.com/wyoming-legislature-goes-all-in-on-blockchain-cryptocurrency-bills). This is positive news about regulation of crypto in the States. Well done and shoutouts to everyone who participated in this.

TL:DR

- Wyoming led the way when it passed the nation’s first LLC law in 1977, and it can again be first by offering the ability to register LLCs on a blockchain.

- Virtual currencies would immediately become exempt from Wyoming's money transmitter laws, which would pave the way for virtual currency exchanges to resume operations in the state.

- CLARITY in defining blockchain-based tokens. Utility tokens would immediately be exempted from Wyoming's securities laws

- To allow for blockchain-based records storage, shareholder management, and shareholder votes

- To create a property tax exemption for cryptocurrencies, like the exemptions that exist for cash, gold, and silver. Even if cryptocurrencies are exempt from Wyoming's state taxes, this does not mean that they will be exempt from federal taxes

This is a large step forward. Kudos to everyone who participated.",1522682338,02/04/2018 15:18:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/890325/5_problockchain_bills_passed_in_wyoming/,8

Bitcoin will get us to the stars.,"If we use the model of cryptocurrencies for planetary currencies on other celestial bodies, this will get us to the stars. The primary driver here is that the new coins on other planets will follow the ICO funding model.

After bitcoin is tested and proven (that is, it is used by a significant portion of Earth for transaction of value, rather than just the first movers and computer guys), this model can then be adapted to Mars, for instance.

It will be a MASSIVE ICO! THIS will fund the exploration of Mars IN AND OF ITSELF. Millions of people will want to be on the ground floor of the new currency, which will be the underlying decentralized infrastructure of a new civilization, one that will start from scratch.

After the ICO is set up on servers and nodes on Earth (but this is not required), those same servers (or duplicates) can be shipped to Mars, and used for their own intraplanetary internet/currency system.

But this doesn't have to be limited to Mars, and indeed it likely will not be. Coins could be developed for the giant moon, Titan, for Pluto, for the moon Europa, for Earth's moon, Luna, and more!

Once more, you don't have to live on Mars to invest. If you're a HODLER, all you need do is buy the coins, and they will go up in value as the exploration of Mars grows. This would be a fantastic funding model for companies like SpaceX or Mars One.

And, the timing could not be more perfect. By about the time humans are getting ready to send their first colonists to Mars (somewhere around 2025), bitcoin will likely have reached sufficient market saturation to be genuinely considered a world currency. Tried, tested, proven.

Yep, the massive distances between the planets means that transactions between them would take a very long time to execute, but these transactions are for the most part not necessary, unless you are moving from one planet to another and wish to exchange currencies.

I had an epiphany about this just a few minutes ago. I can't believe how perfect the timing was. This really could work!

Now, I understand that bitcoin is hemorrhaging right now, so most of you will not be receptive to this concept, but I do hope you will stew on it for a bit. HODL on, my frens. Bitcoin is just the beginning, and it is at its own very beginning. This future is going to explode, and you're still on the ground floor :-)

Listening to this song reminded me of my crypto experience over the last year,"On my way home after a nice chill easter weekend with the family. Getting a slight headache thinking about the pile of emails waiting for me at work tomorrow. Remember the current price of my crypto portfolio. Ugh, better put some metal on to clear my head. That's when I hear these lines:

""Said the skeptic 
Born and bred negative 
No peace for the calm collective 
There's a cold war coming in

Please let me know when it's gone 
It's really not the best of times 
And all we've got is guided by this light within 
I'll hold us both until the smoke clears 
We're suffocating

Sick of our society 
Sick of trying to fit inside a life I cannot lead 
Sick of always following 
Sick of trying to be another cog in their machine 
Sick of running on empty, pushing the blame 
Waiting for tomorrow to save us from today 
There's no profit in poverty 
And I'm running on empty 
I'm running on empty 
Running myself into the ground

We're stacking up 
We're piling high 
We've gone too far to recognise salvation 
This is civil isolation""

If any of that resonated with you as well and/or your initial motivation to get into crypto - don't lose track of why you invested in the first place. It's all gonna be good looking back 5 five years from now, just HODL and prosper.

Recommendations for node setup,"I am torn between two options to set up my node. Some context: my desktop is turn on almost 12 hours everyday, sometimes it is the whole day/week. I also use both electrum and bitcoin core as wallets. At this moment I don't have 100gb in my desktop and I have a pruned node running on `bitcoin@localhost`. Have in mind that I don't need HDD space at all and it seems a little over the top to buy one for my desktop just to set up a node. The options:

*  Getting an external HDD and set up my spare Pi 3 as a full node with `txindex` and `nowallet`. With this setup I would have to also set a electrumx server and connect my desktop to it using bitcoin-qt with the `connect` option and maybe `pruning=600` + `blocksonly`. This would allow me to set a LN node in the pi in the future.

* Just getting [electrum personal server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server). Maybe I will eventually get a decent HDD and enable `txindex`.

Additional question: it is possible to run a full node on a different user (bitcoin@localhost) with bitcoind and connect to it from another user on the same machine with bitcoin-qt?",1522687961,02/04/2018 16:52:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8913qs/recommendations_for_node_setup/,13

Can anybody here who lives in China (or is intimately familiar with current Bitcoin regulations and practice in China) provide an update on what the general Bitcoin economy looks like there?,"Can anyone provide a quick rundown of what it's like to try to buy bitcoin, and what the law is supposed to allow for since the crackdown, and what people are doing to improve regulations or to side-step them?  Can people freely distribute bitcoin if they wish to?  For example, could a company run a promotion that includes Bitcoin as a prize, if that were desirable? Any info related to these sorts of scenarios would be really helpful for me to learn.

My quesiton to you: Has anyone found a particular ATM that does not require you to give your personal info? or is there any true way to purchase BTC without having to give up your personal info?",1522696969,02/04/2018 19:22:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/893tmj/what_is_your_experience_buying_btc_at_an_atm/,0

Does anyone have any experience with Wells Fargo refusing debit transactions or ACH deposits with either of these exchanges?

Confessions of an online professional working in the crypto sector now,"I find there are similarities to many aspects of philosophy. Which is great for someone that likes the feeling of debate in a philosophical fashion but doesn't have an interest in the common subjects (religion, sexuality, etc.), in my opinion.

The crypto community comes together and forms friendly debates, helps each other constantly increase their base level of knowledge and helps one fully ponder their thoughts and ideas. We can all say this is true.

The intellectual stimulation is enthralling and unlike what you will find in any other form of online investing or gambling. Not just the speculative markets; people seem to love the idea of being a crypto entrepreneur -- whether they're making very good money or even just playing a role in a big project for the recognition. 

It's like the digital marketing world where the marketers are all close and there are many online working opportunities (remote and local) which are intriguing (cool startups), opportunities to play the pivotal role and even receive royalties/commissions from the business and so much more. 

The crypto world lets anyone be someone if they're willing to step up and take charge. It's most often rewarding to partake in but sometimes as demanding as playing jury in a high profile murder case. 

The Internet distances you from reality and hardly stimulates you beyond a dopamine effect. It's different with crypto, especially when you invest yourself both financially and professionally. It's one of those rare instances where you get more than a base stimulation/reward from your digital experience. 

You grow as a human, find validation, obtain answers and it keeps you mentally stimulated which is great for mental health and keeping drection in life.

Sure, there are those that can't handle it right... they might investment more than they can afford to lose or become overly irate because they lost what they invested with intent of earning large money in return. Those people are found in all forms of investing and gambling on the web anyway. 

It's more than good its great. The crypto world is so vast. All types of professionals can get involved and you don't have to ""leave crypto"" if one job doesn't work out. Plus, you can distinguish yourself as a professional of something; being an ""expert"" at most forms of marketing isn't nearly as unique, distinguishable and valuable as a professional crypto person. But, I leave that for last as the financial rewards are not what mean the most to me personally.

That's all I have to say!",1522711326,02/04/2018 23:22:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/896aik/confessions_of_an_online_professional_working_in/,16

We just released our private key and seed phrase storage device and we are also accepting #lightning payments! Any payments that get lost or don't go through will still have their orders fulfilled (on us)!,"Hi everyone, first off, thanks for the awesome community I've had here (for a few years just reading) and then being an active part of it. 

There have been a lot of ecommerce shops accepting lightning payments so we are happy to be not only releasing our own product today, but also adding our names to the list of stores accepting lightning payment. 

We are selling a 316 stainless steel unit that is fire-proof, water-proof, and shock-proof to store your private key or or hardware wallet seed phrase in. This protect your seed from burning up in a fire, or having the ink run in the case of flood (or just the passage of time). It supports all key and seed types (up to 24 words), so no need to worry about the tiles not being representative of your particular key or seed.  

You can find our store here: https://billfodl.com/products/the-one-and-only-billfodl

Use offer code ""reddit"" for $5 off a billfodl. 

If you want to pay over lightning, please select the link at the top of the page ""pay with lightning"" and follow the instructions there. Soon, we hope to implement btcpayserver, but right now it won't play nice with shopify. However, we've been talking to the devs there and they are trying to get it working for us. Once that is working, lightning payments should be much easier than they are for us now. 

We also accept all major cryptos (btc, ltc, eth)

If you have any questions, please feel free to dm me. And again, thanks for all the community. ",1522714740,03/04/2018 00:19:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/896pnw/we_just_released_our_private_key_and_seed_phrase/,40

New Crypto/Bitcoin Use Case,"So, if any developers out there want to run with this idea, feel free to do so. I am not claiming any ownership on the idea, as that is against the spirit of the community.

BitCoin Star.

So, the idea is similar to Coinstar, but more like a 2.0 ideological sequel.

Correct me if my assumption is stupid, but wouldn't it be nice AND convenient, if individuals could just dump all of their alt-coin in one shot, and have a conversion of all the alt coins, into Bitcoin.

ALA, coinstar coins, into cash.

If it works for fiat, I believe this could work for Bitcoin, just the same.

For those not in the know, Coinstar machines consolidate loose change into larger cash bills, with an 11.9% fee, which is gross and inappropriate in this particular type of usage.

However, I would gamble that most would be willing to take some level of percentage loss, if there was a solution that allows for a simple consolidation of their multitude of alts, immediately into the ""larger bills"" aka, Bitcoin.

Sample email requesting that a service/business discontinue using BitPay.,"Dear {company-name},

I believe that you provide a valuable service, and appreciate the ability to pay using Bitcoin. However, you are currently using BitPay as your payment processor. This company currently imposes several restrictions on Bitcoin users that similar companies, services, and open-source projects do not impose. One example of this is requiring the use of Payment Protocol, a less secure option compared to standard Bitcoin addresses. Some of the reasons why this change is detrimental are detailed in [this](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/169222582782/bitpay-qr-codes-are-no-longer-valid-important) blog post by Samourai Wallet. BitPay also imposes a ""network fee"" on Bitcoin payments. This fee, despite its intentionally misleading name, is not an inherent network fee. ALL REQUIRED NETWORK FEES ARE SET BY THE USERS WALLET, NOT THE PAYMENT PROCESSOR. This is a shameless attempt to attempt to switch users to Bitcoin Cash (sometimes abbreviated as BCash), a cryptocurrency competing with Bitcoin. Users are not charged an additional fee by BitPay for the use of Bitcoin Cash. I would recommend that you switch Bitcoin payment processors, or accept Bitcoin payments directly, without an intermediary. 




I realize that changing providers can be difficult, and would therefore recommend an open-source software called BTCPay as a replacement for BitPay. BTCPay was designed specifically to replace BitPay, and provides several compelling features for those already using BitPay. BTCPay has an identical API to BitPay, requiring only the base URL to be changed. In addition, BTCPay servers are self-hosted. This removes BitPay as an intermediary, allowing Bitcoin to be used in a true peer-to-peer fashion. BTCPay also experimentally supports the use of the Lighting Network for payment. Lightning Network is a second-layer solution that improves Bitcoin's scalability, privacy, and confirmation times. However, it is emphasised that LN is still in beta stages, and may not be production ready. BTCPay does not require the use of LN. I hope that you will be able to consider removing BitPay from your service, as it will allow more customers to pay with Bitcoin.

Sincerely, {your-name}

Bitcoins killer use case,"Yes there's remittance, inflation resistance, store of value etc which are all great

But I think one obvious use case that is often overlooked, and could be a killer use case is tourism.

How many people travel globally every year. How many people would prefer to use one single currency. How many people would like to avoid using their credit cards for everything overseas all while avoiding exchange rate fees and theft and fraud.

I think there will come a time where large events like FIFA / the olympics etc start accepting bitcoin to attract more international travellers. We are already making headway with airlines and hotels, with expedia and cheap air accepting bitcoin. Even countries like Dubai who are pivoting their entire economies to tourism will see the potential.

I truely believe global tourism may be a killer use case. After all soon holding bitcoin for a few weeks at a time will be less hassle than credit card fees and exchange rate fees as volatility continues to decline.

Thoughts? So now, how do we get the olympics to accept bitcoin?",1522735718,03/04/2018 06:08:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89ajt1/bitcoins_killer_use_case/,65

Considering Crypto Giveaway to High School Students,"I am a high schooler who got super interested in crypto back when I was given Bitcoin from an older friend of mine. I want to do the same for other high school students and am thinking of a way to give it to them safely without someone abusing the system. 

In return, I would also like to learn more about how high school students feel about bitcoin, Blockchain, and cryptocurrencies in general too.  

I have had students ask me about Bitcoin and even downloaded Coinbase to keep track of Bitcoin but never got around to making wallets or actually having Bitcoin. I also had students who bought very small amounts from me as they got interested, such as $10 or $15. It was painful because my coins were in Binance at the time so the withdrawal fees themselves were that amount. 

So far I was thinking of doing a survey that only one person could fill out once but I realized people will fill it out multiple times with different accounts. So I need a better initiative or way to do it. 

Also, do you think it’ll be fair to promote apps or Bitcoin products in exchange for some additional Bitcoin to giveaway? I do not have that much extra but I think the cause is good. What I was thinking is promoting a Bitcoin ATM or certain wallet but they would have to give a certain amount to the giveaway. Probably $5 or $10 to each student. Or if anyone would like to ask certain questions of the surveys, receive the data, and, or can contribute, it will help. I will not take any contributions until I have set up a date and such.

An idea for a Lightning tipping bot,"I think I have a good idea for a Lightning tipping bot for Reddit, Twitter and so on. With the following method the bot keeps as less funds as possible while not excluding users who are not able to run a Lightning node.


The bot would differentiate between two types of users: the ones running a Lightning Node and others who are not.


Because sending funds on the Lightning Network is only possible with an invoice the users running a Lightning node would have to run a little application alongside their node. This application would generate an invoice when the bot asks them to. This invoice would get sent to sender of the tip via direct message. The funds would get transacted directly from the sender to the recipient of the tip.


When the node of a user is offline or not able to generate an invoice while another user wants to send a tip the bot would handle the funds until the node is online again. Then the bot sends the funds to the node of the user.


If a user doesn't run a node or the software generating invoices for the bot the bot would handle this for the user and generate the invoice itself with a Lightning node it is running. The bot would store the funds and keep track of how much a user got tipped. Every time a user without a node gets a tip the bot would send the user a direct message similar to this: ""You got a tip of *value of the tip*. Your balance is now *total balance*. Send an invoice to withdraw!"". Maybe a limit of funds the bot handles for the user would be sensible to create an incentive to withdraw or run a node.


Users who don't run a node and don't have a Lightning wallet could pay invoices sent to them with funds the bot manages for them. 


In addition the Lightning node of the bot could have 0 fees. This would make opening a channel to the bot more attractive. And if sender and recipient are connected to the node of the bot even a tip as small as 1 satoshi would be feasible because there are no fees at all.


The idea for letting an application generate invoices for the user came from /u/starkbot. And I already discussed this topic with /u/throckmortonsign (owner of the account /u/lightningtip) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86q8pn/is_anyone_working_on_an_ln_tipper_bot_here_on/). But this post is more accurate and should give you an idea about how such a bot would work. What do you think? What could be improved? And would you use such a bot?",1522740873,03/04/2018 07:34:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89b67h/an_idea_for_a_lightning_tipping_bot/,0

"This year, the price of bitcoin has fallen by about 51%","On Sunday April 1st, bitcoin, the most valuable encryption currency, fell to $6443 / 54, a new low. And before the weekend's setback, the price of bitcoin has just passed through what investors call ""dead fork"", that is, the 50 - day mobile average penetrates the 200 - day moving average downward, meaning that its price will continue to fall.

Before a few days, there have been anxious traders waiting Sicha technical indicators. Over the past 9 days, bitcoin fell on the 7 day, investors feel alarmed. The first quarter trading ended last week, and bitcoin also suffered the biggest quarterly decline since 2011.

Sicha appeared to make the pessimistic market sentiment, but Monday morning (April 2nd) bitcoin seems to rebound. On Monday, bitcoin prices rose by about 3% to $7020, according to Coindesk, which tracks bitcoin prices.

Although the price of bitcoin rebounded on Monday morning, it is still far below the historic high of 20089 dollars in December 17, 2017. So far this year, bitcoin prices have dropped by about 51%. However, compared to 1 years ago, bitcoin prices still maintained a 538% gain.

This weekend I sold my stash @ $6600 as I figured it'd probably keep dropping to around 5.5k-6k. In the past, I also sold twice in the hopes of buying back cheaper which in both cases did not work out.. :L.

And now, it looks like I screwed myself again. Please do shame me and please do not repeat my foolishness. Let me be the retard so you won't have to be.

Should I run a full node?,"I want to support the bitcoin network by running a full node, but don’t have an ideal hardware setup. My 2 choices for the foreseeable future are a weak laptop that was mid-range when I bought it about 5 years ago or my GPU mining rig. I feel like you’re cringing already. Anyway...

My laptop does exceed the minimum requirements, but doesn’t exceed them by much. 

My rig is a 7 GPU (~200 MH/s) rig that is currently mining ETH (which I then trade for bitcoin ;) 

My internet is decent but not great. I just tested my laptop (on wifi) and got 38 Mbps down and 5.9 up. 

So, is either even worth doing and if so, which one would be better? Would running the node cripple my rig? Is using a laptop that (occasionally) travels with me — down the street or out of town — be pointless? How much of the time would my laptop have to be on? Either way, would I need to use it as a wallet (with or without frequent purchases/trades) for it to be helpful to the network?

And for the wildcard... Can I run a lightning node as well with these?

I’m sure at least a few of these questions are stupid, so I apologize for that. Thanks for any help, guys and gals :)",1522746942,03/04/2018 09:15:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89btgw/should_i_run_a_full_node/,1

Bitcoin vs gold,"Lets say, we are the first 1% who discovered gold. We are digging it, buying it, trading it... Now we are telling everybody, that it has value because its rare. Nobody believes us until they try to find it, dig it, obtain it, buy it. It is not worthless, it has value... Sometimes we have gold rush which points a lot of attention to us and gold. And the value of gold really ascends. Too bad we have this bad 3 months and the price is lower thanks to a lot of new miners and new places to dig... But the key fact is that it spread awareness of gold, that its really valuable. Maybe we dont use it as solar sails in space industry and thus it is overpriced, but we just use it as show off how rich we are as the kings with gold crowns. No, you cant buy food nowadays with gold/diamonds/antimatter, but there will be use of it later. Gold solar sails / diamonds in industrial lasers/cutting and antimatter in reactors to produce electricity... Its just a tool to spread awareness of future use and new thing of value.",1522748528,03/04/2018 09:42:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89bzjo/bitcoin_vs_gold/,0

Bitcoin‘s killer app...,"... has always been individual financial sovereignty. Usecases such as remittance, micro payments, paypercall, etc. as great as some may be, are an after thought. Bitcoin is the first and only exit strategy for individuals unhappy with the status quo. More succinctly, Bitcoin is the alternative to occupying streets in NY and making incoherent and impotent demands.

There is no reason for us to search for a killer app. It has been there since the genesis block. It is Bitcoin‘s most fundamental value proposition and it needs to be made very clear that everything else comes second to improving privacy, fungiblity and immutability.

We do not store what we have...,"Surely many people were tempted to buy inexpensive bitcoins in the past, and then they sold or changed for nothing or, worse, lost. So you can only sympathize.

For example, for the first time bitcoins were exchanged for real goods in May 2010: the American Laszlo Hanech bought two pizzas, paying 10 thousand bitcoins. He did not know that this fast food would be the most expensive in his life.

If you lose the secret key to the system, there will be no other evidence of ownership of the virtual money - that is, the accumulations are irretrievably lost. In November 2013, the BBC television channel told about a resident of the UK, who was inconsolably looking for a local hard drive thrown at him by a local dump with a secret key to the address. In his online wallet since 2009, seven and a half thousand bitcoins were kept. The Englishman learned from the news about the galloping growth rate of the crypto currency and began to tear his hair. At the time of the search operation in the trash, the cost of his bitcoins exceeded seven and a half million dollars ...",1522753954,03/04/2018 11:12:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89clrb/we_do_not_store_what_we_have/,0

Bitcoin is inflationary at 5.1% this year. Fed's goal is 3% inflation. Bitcoin more inflationary than Fed.,"This year, the miners will mine 657,000 new bitcoins. I'm assuming the miners must sell the coins to fund their operations. As of Jan. 24th, 2018, there were a maximum of 16,824,000 coins in circulation. However, it has been estimated that about 4,000,000 coins have been lost (someone fact check this please). Therefore bitcoin is not deflationary. It is inflationary at slightly over 5.1%. The Fed is targeting 3% inflation. So bitcoin is more inflationary than the Fed right now. Am I correct?",1522755410,03/04/2018 11:36:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89csev/bitcoin_is_inflationary_at_51_this_year_feds_goal/,2

Why Bitcoin ISN'T Dead: The Petro Comparison,"Hey Reddit! You get your crypto taxes done? Hope so -- mine were a headache, and I'm probably going to write an article about it soon. Who would have thought that I'd have to write code just to get the spot values of different coins on different dates? Whew!

That's not what this post is about, though. This post is about Bitcoin. We all know there has been a steady drop since the all-time-high back in December of 2017, and some people are getting nervous. I'm here to tell you it's not all bad: there's light at the end of the tunnel, and price isn't what you should be concentrating on anyway.

Cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, is the future of the financial system and will revolutionize a lot of industries. Speculation is not the point, and many people have lost sight of that. It's time to refocus and get back to the basics, and to do that, I'm going to talk about the Petro and how it compares to Bitcoin. So, take a look at my latest article and let me know what you think - [Why Bitcoin ISN'T Dead: The Petro Comparison](https://medium.com/@malcolmrosegaming/why-bitcoin-isnt-dead-the-petro-comparison-41ba96defc35).",1522761337,03/04/2018 13:15:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89dm9o/why_bitcoin_isnt_dead_the_petro_comparison/,7
Flipping Bitcoin - legal? Another Drunken Idea,"Got drunk again and made up some more ideas and I decided to try this out a few months ago (still going on)

I'm buying bitcoin from the open market or from desperate teenagers that need the money bad (bank money-&gt;bitcoin) and I'm selling it by hanging a sign that says 'Selling bitcoin for cash' on my neck and walk around for a few hours. Usually works. Sometime doesn't.

Made quite a few regulars and I'm making 5 grand on the side, mostly from teenagers but I make sure to ask them if they are underage and record it (of course, they lie)

Will this get me in trouble?",1522761747,03/04/2018 13:22:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89dond/flipping_bitcoin_legal_another_drunken_idea/,1

32 million BTC wallets in existence according to BitInfoCharts. This surely can't include all exchange wallets in existence?,"https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html

32 million BTC wallets in existence according to BitInfoCharts. 

However, Coinbase has 10+ million customers who each have a wallet and some even sub-accounts with wallets. Binance has 8+ million customers. Bittrex, Bitstamp, Huobi, Okex are all other exchanges with millions of users. 

Do exchange wallets operate differently or are their data simply not included in BitInfoCharts?

If they're not included, it would mean the existing investor base for Bitcoin is a lot bigger than many think... (even if a sizeable portion of investors have many wallets and are signed up on many exchanges)

Two Questions Regarding Institutional Investors - GBTC and Liquidity,"What is stopping institutional investors from investing in GBTC? Cant my family's financial adviser buy shares of GBTC, which represents small amounts of Bitcoin? Can't hedgefunds/etfs include GBTC in their holdings??

I hear that there is a liquidity problem for big Bitcoin investors. Market orders of $100M could drastically change the price of Bitcoin. Isn't this the same for publicly traded stocks? Take a look at Mastercard for example. Mastercard (MA) is valued at roughly $200B and has roughly $660M in trading volume per day. Bitcoin is valued at roughly $125B and has roughly $5B trading volume per day. Even if 75% of that volume is wash trading, it is still higher than MA's volume.

So what is stopping institutional money from investing in Bitcoin?",1522778805,03/04/2018 18:06:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89gnh2/two_questions_regarding_institutional_investors/,0

"Popular misconceptions about money, Bitcoin, and how all the competition between currencies will play out","Money is best seen as a social behavior or accounting tool a society uses to track favors.

Sometimes a currency may have a non-monetary value (often called ‘intrinsic’ value) and a monetary value.  All things being equal, a currency that has no non-monetary (intrinsic) value is a better currency than one that does.

An economy does not need an expanding money supply to function.

Inflation (monetary) cannot happen without an inflator; that is to say that the money supply does not grow uniformly, but rather some entity is granted new currency units which provides them a significant economic advantage other users of that currency (usually) do not have.  

Many people view the act of spending currency “using money”.  This is an incomplete view that can lead to some very wrong conclusions.  A better understanding of the use of a currency is that someone begins using a currency when he accepts it, continues using while holding it, and ends their use of it when they finally spend it.

Savings...e.g. money stored under a matress, provides individuals, corporations, governments, and whole economies an ability to absorb economic disruption and take advantage of opportunities that arrive by remaining uncommitted to a particular investment.  That is to say savers or hoarders provide a great deal of benefit to the underlying economy.  In addition to this benefit, hoarding a currency provides it with liquidity which is essential to having a viable currency.  

Destruction of a currency such as if someone burned his or her own money bin, is effectively a form of altruism or charity, whereby they transfer their economic power to others via monetary contraction.  That is, if someone were to acquire a bunch of money over their lifetime, and then burn it all, this person should be viewed as a selfless hero. 

A deflationary (or fixed supply) currency with equal or superior monetary properties cannot exist in equilibrium with inflationary currencies.

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency with superior monetary properties vs ALL traditional currencies (fiat, gold, etc).  And will compete against each of those currencies until they all die or bitcoin dies.  Also Bitcoin is immortal.  

Money is a monopolistic market, where network advantages are *very* significant and provide a substantial barrier to new comers.  Basically in order to overcome a lead in network effect advantage, a competing currency would have to offer very significant benefits over the market leader.  Bitcoin appears to be doing this with respect to USD/EUR/Gold/Etc, but the idea that alt coins could overtake Bitcoin would require an economic consensus for everyone to switch.  And we all know how difficult a consensus change is to achieve; it would be the equivalent of someone saying they think an Elvis impersonator could come about that would supplant the original in popularity because he offers NEW features the original doesn’t, like officiating low-class weddings. 

Thus, a rational person could conclude that one day soon, everyone will be forced to accept Bitcoin, as no one will accept any other currencies.  See [Their’s Law]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law#Reverse_of_Gresham's_Law_(Thiers'_Law).  

Governments obtain a fairly significant amount of their funding through seigniorage.  Bitcoin will cut off this avenue of funding, so in addition to destroying gold and all fiat and altcoin currencies, it will impose financial discipline on governments, effectively putting an end to big government and unnecessary wars. 

To sum it up, Bitcoin is a panacea that cures the world’s economic and financial ills.

Been a bitcoiner for a long time and...,"I find it hilarious that people are going to look at this thing and say its dead. So funny. Remember when it was rational to think this was a dumb little project that was kinda neat? Remember the realization that you're actually the dumb little mf-er that didn't see the crazy potential? Remember when it ACTUALLY hit you that this whole technology is unprecedented and amazing? 

To the people that are intelligent, remember how dumb the average person is... Then realize that the other half of people is even dumber than that. They don't give a fuck about how their credit card works, how their car engine works, how their a/c system works, or anything else other than their own interests (like me). So if you stand to be the gatekeeper or beneficiary of those new technologies that all these plebians will use, you will benefit. This system will be used. 

Do you see any other system like Bitcoin functioning well without central coordination? Any other high-tech cutting edge drug markets? Any other ransomware markets? Remittance markets? nawh son. maybe a few other alts sure, but the most secure (network wise) is still btc.

use your head. Don't get fooled or convinced by posts of people that are likely a lot dumber or greedier than you are and don't be tempted to ""trade"". You're looking at the next Microsoft, the next Google, the next JP Morgan, the next automobile, the next era.... and you want to trade up for a single lambo? LMAO

I am pretty new with it, I've seen a few videos and articles. From one that I saw, it was saying that if someone runs a transaction through your node, you need to have a balance equal or higher than the amount they wanted to send in order to have it go through.

So i'm seeing If i'm interpreting this correctly. If I drum up a lightning node and have a 0 or low balance in it, does this do anything for the network or do I need to have an actual balance to have any effect.

"How do I file crypto taxes, when most of my cost basis was from referral bonuses?","As I am trying to calculate my crypto tax, I've realized that services like TokenTax and Bitcoin.tax are not my best resources.

I received a nice chunk of Bitcoin from referring people to Coinbase over the last couple of years.

Should I count my cost basis as $0 for any coin-to-coin exchange or sells since these Bitcoins were technically ""gifted"" to me?

Or should I count the individual $10 referrals bonuses as USD income like on a 1099 and then use that $10 as my cost basis?

"If full nodes validate the blockchain, why do we need miners at all?","I'm probably missing something pretty basic but I can't find what it is. Perhaps you all can help.

I know that miners use proof of work to add a block to the blockchain every ten minutes, and that the miner who spent the most work gets to add the block and give themselves the BTC reward. An evil miner could spend a lot of work to enter an invalid block but it would be rejected by the fully validating nodes of the network and their money would be wasted.

But why do we need the miners in the first place? I propose a miner-less systems that works in the following way:
1. Users transfer Bitcoin to one another, with a transaction fee in the transaction (like it is today).
2. Every ten minutes, fully validating nodes create a block with the top transactions (the ones with the most fees) and propagate the block to other nodes. Invalid transactions (double spend, improperly signed, etc) are of course discarded.
3. The fees are burned.

In this model no one really has a motivation to run a full node but that's also true today and many people still do it. 

Why do we need the miners?",1522812137,04/04/2018 03:22:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89lvi5/if_full_nodes_validate_the_blockchain_why_do_we/,4

I've recently found a podcast that caters to going in depth in regards to the crypto market and space. I listened to this episode of History of BTC on Fireside Crypto Podcast and figured this subbreddit would enjoy. I listen on Google play but they have iTunes as well. It isn't as in depth as their other episodes but you'll get the jest.

It seems to me since the IRS 2014/2018 guidelines did not claim crypto to crypto as a gain event in the examples or text the right thing to do is report all crypto to non crypto trades/gains and only if the irs makes new guidance file an amended return on crypto to crypto swaps.,"It seems to me since the IRS 2014/2018 guidelines did not claim crypto to crypto as a gain event in the examples or text the right thing to do is report all crypto to non crypto trades/gains and only if the irs makes new guidance file an amended return on crypto to crypto swaps.

(To those who no doubt will link the 2014  guidance please READthe text and examples and recognize that what i say is true and if you are imputing meaning that is not written that is not the same thing as the IRS saying it.)

Edit: as was just pointed out to me the brand new IRS guidance issued mar 23, 2018 ALSO EXCLUDES CRYPTO TO CRYPTO MENTION AND EXAMPLES   lending further credence thst they dont mean that to be taxable. If they did that statement would have been the perfect time to clarify that.  https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-reminds-taxpayers-to-report-virtual-currency-transactions

Also be aware that since tax preparers can be held liable for taxes later determined to be owed by clients, what is ""the safest position"" for them may cost you a pretty penny in unnecessary tax payments for them to avoid risk. So in the case of ambiguity their advise and self interest may not be in alignment with your own goal of paying the minimum legal taxes due.

Also if you want to have any chance of claiming crypto to crypto was not meant to be taxed on future returns that would be kind of hard to do if you fiked a previous return where you indicated you thought otherwise 


So anyway the wisest financial course seems to be report and pay taxes on crypto transactions the IRS specifically says are taxable in the 2014 guidance. If they later issue a correction or new guidance or congress passes a new tax law specifically covering crypto to crypto then amend any needed returns. If audited it will be hard for them to make a case for penalties when theor own guidance did not say crypto to crypto was taxable or exampled and it was in fact excluded from the numerous examples.

Disclaimer: i am not an accountant or attorney and this is not legal or financial advice. This is my opinion on a very complex subject that is stumping all actual experts and for which there is no case law or much guidance from the IRS or Congress",1522824901,04/04/2018 06:55:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89n7n1/it_seems_to_me_since_the_irs_20142018_guidelines/,8

Short BIP39 mnemonics are insecure!,"If you have used tools such as iancoleman's to generate a seed phrase yourself, please be aware that anything under 9 (or even 12) words is insecure, since the entropy they offer is too low (32 bits for 3-word and 64 bits for 6-word mnemonic phrases), making the wallets generated using them extremely easy to bruteforce.

I still don't get why are they allowed at all, but you totally should not use them.


TL;DR:

If your mnemonic looks like one of those three below (these are invalid, **it's just the length that matters**), it's fine (18 and 21 omitted, because they're longer than 12 words and are also good):

* 12 words: ""liar vast comic modify casino various width insane hidden enroll imitate example""

* 15 words: ""economy piece twist cry student hard reopen chapter find crew receive property custom question example""

* 24 words: ""odor cake toss select swap cup twice fragile champion curtain divide cat demise sting vacant patch magnet document cake void toilet garbage soup example""

However, if your mnemonic looks like these, then you have to generate a longer one and transfer the funds immediately:

* 3 words: ""indoor simple example""

* 6 words: ""seat wheat detail bounce rally example""

* 9 words: ""juice glance artist menu small invite patch warrior example""

"I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox. Ask me anything.","Dear community,

Many of you know or remember me, especially recently since the MtGox bankruptcy has been allegedly linked with Bitcoin price drops in December 2017 to February 2018. Since taking over the most active Bitcoin exchange in 2011, I ran MtGox until filing for civil rehabilitation on February 28th 2014 (which became bankruptcy less than 2 months later) because a large amount of Bitcoins went missing. Since then, four years have passed, and MtGox is still in bankruptcy today. I’ve been arrested, released under bail after a little less than one year, and am now trying to assist MtGox getting into civil rehabilitation.

I did my best trying to grow the ecosystem by running the biggest exchange at the time. It had big problems but still managed to hang in there. For a while. A quite long while, even, while the rest of the ecosystem caught up. At the end of the day, the methods I chose to try to get MtGox out of its trouble ended up being insufficient, insufficiently executed, or plain wrong.

I know I didn't handle the last, stressful days of the outdrawn and painful Gox collapse very well. I can only be humble about that in hindsight. Once again, I’m sorry.

Japanese bankruptcy law has a particularly nasty outcome here, and I want to address this up front. As creditors claims were registered, those claims were registered in the valuation of Japanese Yen on the bankruptcy date. That's the only way Japanese bankruptcy law can work (most bankruptcy laws around the world operate this way for that matter). This means that the claims can be paid back in full, and there will still be over 160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash in assets in the Gox estate. The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.

That's the only way any bankruptcy law can reasonably work. And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.

I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen. I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.

I’m an engineer at heart. I want to build things. I like seeing what I build being useful, and people being happy using what I build. My drive, from day one, has been to push the limits of what is technically possible, and this is the main reason I liked and have been involved with Bitcoin in the first place. When I took over MtGox, I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.

Hopefully, I can make what I’ve learned in this experience useful to the community as a whole, so there can at least be something positive in the end.

Ask me anything you like.

**EDIT**: With this coming to r/all there have been an overwhelming number of messages, questions etc. I will continue responding for a little while but probably won't be able to respond to new questions (it is starting to be late here and I've been spending the last few hours typing).

Uni student with some questions.,"I've really enjoyed listening to aantonop talk and I basically have him playing in the background whenever I am programming or developing my own projects.

I have a couple questions about Bitcoin:


Bitcoin miners mine to process your transaction and place it into the blocks, they compete with each other to get that transaction through proof of work and get paid in Bitcoin which is not in circulation.

My question is, what happens in years to come when we reach 21 million in circulation,no mineable bitcoin is left so miners won't get paid in anything so what incentive do they have to carry on processing transactions.


Another question, aantonop doesn't really think we should look at the price of bitcoin because that's not what the project is about but I can't help but ponder about it. What do you guys think will happen to the Bitcoin price as more USD pairs are brought into the market? 


Also is there somewhere I can see the average txt/fee and txt/time for Lightning Network, I'm really unsure about if there has been an improvement or not. It got really bad December time but I wasn't that interested in Bitcoin at the time so didn't really care. Have we seen improvements since the Lightning Network was released? I know not a lot of nodes are using it but there must be some data out there.



I love the idea of banking the unbanked (also a supporter of the OMG project), and it's truly an exciting thing to hopefully see in our lifetimes of billions of people across the world decoupling themselves from their government.

I look forward to purchasing aantonop's book for e-reader soon to further expand my knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol.

When they made such transaction to my Bitfinex wallet (where was 3 outputs to my wallet addrees, instead of 1), Bitfinex does not recognized this transaction and credited only 1 part of 3. Here is this transaction https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/tx/3c9cc3bdf93641b360df0627eb3288590515e90cae1c8b281b80fb3067740ef8/

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but upon using a financial asset in a transaction you are deemed to have sold it into the market for what you got or its fair market value and that triggers a capital gains tax.","If you traded a rental property or a pile of gold futures contracts for a boat you would pay a capital tax gains on the fair market value of the house/ pile. 

If you exchange the Bitcoin commodity you bought for $1/Bitcoin and used it when it it was $19k/Bitcoin you presumably are on the hook for the capital gains on the Bitcoin end. Using it in mercantile trade is not a way out of paying taxes on the gains in the eyes of the tax man.

Seems like a rather complicated way of trading to me. Every time you transact you should be putting money aside to cover any gains that you incurred.

This is the time to buy bitcoin,"For those newcomers out there in this subreddit (and I know there are many of you, as the subreddit has grown very rapidly in the last 12 months), this is the time to buy.

In all the times that you felt left out, on the sidelines with no capital to invest that will yield any significant amount of bitcoin, the door has now opened. For most, when good things happen such as the price rising meteorically, they feel very good and sort of just ""ride the wave."" Unfortunately, those same people usually ride the wave down as well. Therefore, when it comes time when the price has dipped into ranges like we see today, misery increases.

We are social creatures, and thus we mimic each others' emotions in order to fit in. Fitting in, however, is not how you get ahead. It's not how you make money. In order to do that, you need to go against the grain and take risks. The risk that presents itself in these situations is the possibility of community disillusionment to such an extreme degree that we see capitulation to much lower levels. This, however unlikely, is still a possibility.

To summarize what I'm saying here, most of us simply ""project"" the sentiments of those around us, rather than exercising our own agency. When this happens, our free will is stripped of us, and we get stuck in a loop that is beholden to the whims of the collective.

To have agency requires suffering, sadly... And a lot of it.

Those ""evil"" people, such as Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and others, have acquired so much wealth in this ecosystem because they have bought through the horrific dips (and undoubtedly helped to cause some, but for now, that's beside the point). These types of people, unfortunately, are banking on you showing that you do not exist as a sovereign individual, and thus being justified in treating you as some type of slave. It's sickening, but true. There aren't too many people like Ver and Wu in this world, but there are enough of them to do some real damage.

The philosophy that may help you to get through this painful cycle is to think of it this way: you're taking coins out of the hands of Wu and Ver, and those like them. Your hands will be more steady in their actions, more virtuous, and will help build things. Not only does this increase your strength, but in however small a manner, it decreases theirs.

That's why it is those who truly believe in the idea of bitcoin that tend to buy more in the dips, and acquire more of a market share... And why bad actors do so as well, from what I can tell. Bad actors have a belief that you are not able to make your own decisions. Good actors have a belief that something beautiful can come out of this all.

What is the one unifying factor of it all? There is some type of belief. That's the way it always is. You only have efficacy in the world if you believe in something, no matter what it is. Prove you want bitcoin and aren't simply a projection by suffering mightily through these periods, and buying more.

That's all. Have a good day, and keep kicking ass and taking names, bitcoiners :-)",1522855315,04/04/2018 15:21:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89qe8r/this_is_the_time_to_buy_bitcoin/,179

"CoPay, GDAX, and BitPay Visa fees","I love my new BitPay Visa card. My restaurant habit for years is $3000 a month so I find myself buying $3000 a month of Bitcoin now and spending it all through my BitPay card. My hodl coin collection is separate from this.

For my BitPay card, I buy around $700/weekly with gdax and square cash app and find fees and market rates work out to 1% or less each buy. Is this the best I can do or are there ways to get less than 1%? I'm looking to try lowest fees while converting $3000 per month of BTC to Visa.

Both square and GDAX(limit buy) say 0 fees, but if I have $500 USD in GDAX or $500 USD on square, and transfer to my BitPay visa in 5-10 minutes, I lose around 1%.  For instance, I limit buy BTC on GDAX for a penny less than market, send to my CoPay BTC wallet, submit a buy on my BitPay card, and send from CoPay to BitPay.  I end up with about $4 less on my BitPay card than I had to begin with on GDAX or Square.  I've tried this several times and I don't think it's the BTC market moving against me each time.  I think their free fees come with a trading spread that's costing me 1%.  The BTC fees for two transfers are around 25 cents.

I know I can get 0 fees by skipping cryptocurrency altogether and going back to my bank debit card, but I want actual hands on experience with blockchain and BTC tech. I'm going to try this for at least 6 months, changing tech and learning what I can about it.

The fees over 6 months may be $100 but that is a cheap education. I also leave a similar balance on my phone BTC wallet just in case I find a merchant that would accept BTC directly rather than my BitPay visa. It's fun to be that nerdy guy talking to them about converting and saving fees as I check out.

I've had the card a week and my biggest BitPay spends so far are dinners out for $150, $80, and $50 and gas for $50. Lots of $5 lattes too.  I'm having fun spending BTC.",1522857215,04/04/2018 15:53:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89qotj/copay_gdax_and_bitpay_visa_fees/,1

The whitepaper laid out a solution that could not only improve various scaling properties of Bitcoin, but also drastically improve transaction privacy, much like a privacy coin.

Regarding MT GOX... Could cause 10x the harm of original “Mishandling Of people’s Currency”,"Maybe this is a naive question but.  Why the Frick was the ruling decided that the value of the BTC at the time of the theft would only be returned????

Solution #1:  Return the 1 BTC for 1 BTC

Solution#1a:  if this is Currency then pay back in the same currency that was stolen.... why convert it to the Fiat equivalent????

MT GOX unfortunately will have the boomerang effect that could equal as much if not more of an effect than the original Damning theft in this space! 

Disclaimer: I haven’t read the ruling, and comments about this... so I might be echoing as “captain obvious”. 

The trustee has acted irresponsibly and really taken mass adoption backwards!  Maybe that was the point

Obvious point #2: someone with that many BTC creates centralization, at least Temporarily.... pisses me off!!! Untrustworthy and irresponsible!

"I had this POP ""Point of purchase"" app for some time and just recently they added bitcoin buying.. and .. I just discovered a perfect loophole in a POP app.. which allows you to purchase bitcoins with a credit cards ""U.S residents""","Basically you need to do this with a friend or another phone, a payment charged , once the payment is received its sent back and I make a bitcoin purchase with the funds.. ""obviously"" you need to do this with someone you know or a clone phone"" I tested this out with my brother. works fine... 


Not gonna say the name.. since I really want to use this opportunity.. but if you can think outside the box and do a search for POP apps on android or apple.. I'm pretty sure you can figure it out....




""Once you figure it out"" please dont spam this out...... and ruin it for everyone else.. 

I give this about few months or so.. before its cut short.. good luck everyone!

"Meet 'Sirius' Martti, Satoshi's 1st Contributor to Bitcoin - next Monday in SF (Bay Area) or Livestream!","Without Martti 'Sirius' Malmi, Bitcoin may never have gotten off the ground - according to The Verge*, Business Insider*, Reddit*, and the git* history itself.

While usually a quiet, lone wolf out in Finland, Martti has joined the decentralized Open Source project GUN, which is ranked* #2 in Blockchain technologies. We have flown him out to the Bay Area for a visit, meet with developers and the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities.

Come hear the inside story of how Satoshi came to trust him with the Bitcoin domains, how he ran the bitcointalk forums, built the GUI that made Bitcoin usable by non-programmers, wrote some of the earliest C++ code, and even performed the very first Bitcoin to USD exchange in history - approximately 5K BTC for $5 via PayPal.

If you are in the Bay Area and can come in person to SF, please RSVP at https://www.facebook.com/events/159991728160665/ .

For everybody else, please give us a shout if you want us to do a livestream so we know to prioritize it.

"Skyrus - a dedicated lightning node, feel free to open some mainnet payment channels!","Lightning software is just beginning but mainnet progress has come quite far already! I wanted to introduce my node which I'm excited about and will continually be working on.

Skyrus is a dedicated node to provide liquidity and other lightning payment tools. Now with a mainnet wallet released, you can begin establishing real payment channels to nodes on the network such as mine. Here is a simple guide to begin creating channels to Skyrus via eclair:

First you will need to fund the wallet like any other bitcoin wallet.

1. Swipe to the leftmost tab in Eclair (""Your Bitcoin Address"")
2. There you can see the bitcoin address and can fund it in all of the familiar ways

Once a payment is confirmed, now you can begin creating channels:

1. Visit [skyrus.net](https://skyrus.net) to find the node URI
2. In Eclair, swipe to the rightmost tab (""Lightning Channels"")
3. Press ""Scan a Node URI"" and scan the QR code on the site.
4. Type in the channel capacity you would like to fund with. (All lightning software is new and you should be careful not to fund too much!!)

Once the channel funding transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you can begin making micropayments. Channels you open with Skyrus will be long lasting as the node will be in service indefinitely and I work hard to keep it smooth sailing. This means you will be able to make very cheap payments even in times of high bitcoin onchain fees.

Of course feel free to ask me for any other questions regarding the node or other lightning network questions in general. :D",1522877306,04/04/2018 21:28:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89tp5y/skyrus_a_dedicated_lightning_node_feel_free_to/,6

A lil crypto poem for ya’ll,"Roses are red,

Violets are blue,

If you bought crypto in December,

Your portfolio is hurting you,

They told me to HODL,

And that the moon would come soon,

I kept asking, “when lambo?”

They tell me, “next June”

Who can I trust in this crypto sphere,

So many agendas,

All the discord channels posting @here,

Airdrops! Airdrops! Airdrops Galore!

I keep collecting my crypto,

But I always want more,

Oh what will come of this crypto space?

Will we be the next winners?

Or get a slap in the face?

Only time will tell,

So I take my pace,

One step at a time in this crypto race.

Why has Cuba been closed for Bitcoin?,"With ""Cubazon"" unilaterally acting as the heavily-guarded gateway to the global Internet any talks about introducing crypto-currencies into the Cuban economy look today as some cosmic opera's episode, where the Blockstream Satellite fleet boldly assaults Coruscant's airspace with Luke Skywalker speeches' broadcasts. Among other proposed solutions is, for example, stretching WiFi from the Key West to the island with WF dishes and then spreading micro-solar panels with antennas all over Havana's roof-tops (see the whole discussion of this hilarious proposal: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6pdy3a/bitcoin_in_cuba/).

However, until a practically feasible answer to the question of how to breach the on-line wall, separating Cuba from the rest of the world, would be found Banco Central de Cuba (BCC) has absolutely nothing to fear from part of crypto-revolutionaries. Moreover, even if, say, Mask's Starlink will find a way to crash or by-pass legal and physical obstacles on its way to bathe Cuba in high-speed Internet access, local regulators will have no difficulties what so ever to make Cuban future crypto-community's life difficult as hell.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: prohibitive;
economic climate: hostile;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: e-commerce, FinTech;
major limitations: government politics towards private entrepreneurship and Internet access;
opportunities: very high educational level of population (almost 100%).
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): absent (negative).

Bitcoin is like Records&gt;CD’s&gt;Online Streaming.,"To me, the music industry technological advances mirror, in a similar way, the challenges and acceptance that bitcoin is facing today from people used to traditional banking and assets. 

Records were a huge advancement for music back in the day. You could finally afford to get that music playing machine for your home and get that vinyl record of your favorite band locked into the grove!  The record players were big, bulky and not easy to use, but that only was recognized when cassette tapes and later CD’s were invented.  What I remember during this time was “vinyl sounds better”, “CD’s are pointless” and other reasons people wanted to hold onto their record players.

CD’s soon became the go to for music. After awhile it was rare for people to use records and no new music was produced on anything but CD’s. Do you remember Tower Records or Sam Goody? CD’s and CD players were a hit. Now when Napster and later iTunes online streaming came along, there was a big fight. 

Musicians hated streaming music. CD companies hated streaming music. Of course it was all due to them losing money and not being able to control everything.  While streaming music was better, cheaper, and faster than CD’s, you had the whole music industry fighting to shut it down with lawsuits, slander, and negative media attention. It lasted for years longer than people would expect and in the end the old music industry had to adapt to the technological advances, no matter how much they wanted to hold on to their old ways.

Wonder what this compares to now?",1522892213,05/04/2018 01:36:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89vn0v/bitcoin_is_like_recordscdsonline_streaming/,1

My experience using Eclair to make a Lightning Network purchase today!,"I was pretty excited to try Eclair and took notes as I did it so I could share my experience:

---------------------


1. Went to Google Play Store. Downloaded Eclair Wallet for Mainnet (be careful. Eclair for Testnet is the first app to show up on the Play Store.) 

2. Downloaded it. 23 MB took about 1 minute on wifi. 

3. Set it up. Copying down the 24 word seed phrase took 30 seconds. Then I had to verify that I wrote down the seed phrase which by typing in 3 of the words. 

4. W00t! Eclair is all set up. Now to send a few bits from an exchange to my new wallet. I got lucky and it confirmed within 5 minutes. 

5. I want to open a channel. I'll just open one to the ACINQ node because there's a button that does that automatically. 

6. It's been 5 whole minutes and my channel still isn't open. I'm going to get a burrito and maybe when I'm back it'll be open.

7. I now have a burrito and an open lightning channel :) Time to buy stickers and a t-shirt. 

8. Put 2 stickers and a t-shirt in my cart at the Blockstream store. Type in my address. Blockstream store generates a payment request QR code. I scan it. 3 errors. I think the channels between Eclair's node and blockstream have some sort of issue but I don't feel like troubleshooting it now. 

9. Close the channel to ACINQ node so I can put funds in a channel to a node with more connections. 

10. I want to connect to the SLEEPYARK node. It looks well-connected. The only ways to add a specific node are to either paste in the node URI or scan a QR code. I can't find SLEEPYARK's URI in a QR code nor in the 'nodeId@host:port' format anywhere and I don't like typing on my phone so I'm going to make a QR code on my computer by googling the nodeId, host and port and putting them in the appropriate format, then converting it to a QR code on some random website. 

11. Put 2 stickers and a t-shirt in my cart at the Blockstream store. Type in my address. Blockstream store generates a payment request QR code. I scan it. [PAYMENT SENT!](https://i.imgur.com/qqEwphl.jpg) Wow that was fast (fraction of a second).  

12. Write reddit post about my experience. 

------------

Summary: Setting up Eclair was easy. If you can figure out how to set up a Coinbase account with 2FA you can figure out how to set up Eclair. 

 It took about 5 minutes of my attention to set up (if you don't count the time spent waiting for tx confirmation). The future is pretty much here!
 I don't think finding good nodes to connect to is idiot-proof *yet*. Blockstream Shop charged me $12 to mail a t-shirt and 2 stickers which seems excessive.

 But soon everyone will see my t-shirt and know that I do not subscribe to the ideology of trusted 3rd parties. ",1522900752,05/04/2018 03:59:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89wm2l/my_experience_using_eclair_to_make_a_lightning/,5

"Bitcoin Unix Epoch ""Y2K bug""?","I'm new to bitcoin, and have been reading the excellent Mastering Bitcoin O'Reilly book by A Antonopoulos and like, I have a really obvious question. Blockchain headers contain a 4-byte Unix timestamp (seconds since Jan 1, 1970).  Unix timestamps will overflow on January 19, 2038 03:14:07 GMT, but the bitcoin network is supposed to be more or less operational (ie handing out more bitcoin to lucky miners) until 2140.

Ok so my question: what's going to happen to bitcoins mined before the epoch expiration? since this is in the block header, will it fuck up the chain? why didn't anyone think of this when they were putting the protocol together? or are people actively fixing this? is bitcoin as we know it fucked?

My first time Bitcoin use.,"I have not had any use / opportunity to use my bitcoin ao far.  I was very much looking forward to be paying for coffee at my local coffee shop in the near future.  Unfortunately adoption by the shop is not feasible or easy right now.  
A trojan infected my computer via Windows remote desktop and a scrambled all of my documents, pictures and data.  The perpetrator requires a ransom in the form of BTC.  I emailed this party and we have negotiated a reduced fee and it now looks like my first use for Bitcoin is going to be to create proceeds for a crime.

"RBI Bans Indian Banks from dealing with Cryptocurrencies, plans own Crypto","BP Kanungo, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) just announced that entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individuals or services dealing with or settling virtual cryptocurrencies. All Banks are regulated by the RBI and hence, they will not be allowed to provide their services to Cryptocurrency exchanges. 

At this point, it is too early to call it a complete ban on Cryptocurrencies in India. We need to wait for further confirmation on this, since it was not discussed in detail. He also said existing entities should terminate their relationships within 3 months. 

He spoke in favour of Blockchain but not Cryptocurrencies because it is not possible for them to regulate it. ",1522929448,05/04/2018 11:57:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89z2b8/rbi_bans_indian_banks_from_dealing_with/,0

People of India. RBI becoming Roadblock for transacting in Bitcoins,"People of India. RBI has given recommendation to ban Transaction of Crypto Currency via Banks. Their contention being :

 1) Money Laundering
2) Consumer Protection
3) Market Integrity
4) Taxability

Eventhough they are not the Government but it's likely they will initiate and release this circular and notification in the near future after consulting with them and ask them to take necessary steps....

Now comes the main crux of the issue Taxability.

So people are still confused as to whether the gains from this crypto will be considered under what head of Income and taxed at what rate.....

So as per General Parlance. I suggest you look at the following facts to help you decide what head it is considered under :

1) Whether you Bought the Crypto via Real Official Crypto Exchange.

2) If yes to the above Question then ask yourself whether the same was an Investment or is it your business. If Investment then it's your Capital Gains other than shares and properties. Depending on your period of holding you will be taxed as per slab rates depending on your income if you are an individual. If it's for business then it will be charged as per Income from Business.

3) if you received crypto currency in lieu of Sale or service. Then it is your Business Income. It will be chargeable to tax as per your slab rate if you are an individual.

4) If you earned it via Mining. Then as of now your Crypto Currencies are tax free....however Indian Government is planning to tax this income as well.....to be on the safe side I suggest you see Point 3) and pay tax based on it. Since you are providing service by mining respective blockchain by using your hardware.


Hope this clears up majority of the issues that people of India had when it came to Taxability etc....

"Crypto Selloff Driven by $25 Billion Capital Gain Hit, Tom Lee Says","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/crypto-rout-driven-by-25-billion-capital-gain-hit-tom-lee-says

**Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day.**

The April 15 income-tax filing deadline is contributing to crypto’s falling prices as investors who won big betting on the digital tokens sell some of their remaining holdings to pay $25 billion in capital-gains levies, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note Thursday. Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.

“This is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,” Lee wrote. “Historical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.”

Lee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017.

**A crypto bull who maintains a year-end price target on Bitcoin of $25,000, Lee sees the selling pressure passing.**

“We still like Bitcoin and large-caps,” he said, adding that “while we believe the bear market for alt coins is largely over, we do not see upside for alts until mid-August.”",1522945721,05/04/2018 16:28:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8a15wh/crypto_selloff_driven_by_25_billion_capital_gain/,0

"I owned my 9 years old brother 2.5$, I sent him 10$ in bitcoin and he was super excited.","Hi there!

Firstly, this is my brother and he is so excited: http://i.imgur.com/OK52ErQ.jpg

I am a student in university and I have invested in bitcoin and other altcoins a big amount of money that I earned from another job.
Because I am broke af for now (I have to pay a monthly loan that my family has), I borrowed my little brother 2.5$ to get out when I returned to my city of born. (my parents were not at home)

So, he was asking me for the money some days later and I proposed to send him 10$ in ""computer cash"". I told him that he would be able to access them some years later and it could have a much higher value.

He was so excited and he is asking me to give him bitcoins instead of his coins.

From now on, I will send as much bitcoins as I can for his future. Maybe I give him access to the wallet when he will be 16 years or older.

It is time for me to start teaching him about internet, bitcoin and the blockchain. It can be hard, but I would be happy if someone taught me about bitcoin when I was playing counter-strike 1.6 24/7.

Bitcoin moons fueled by debt?,Its a theory but I am just thinking when bitcoin reaches a steady rate of growth to cover interest rates on debt then this is when the mega money comes in. Its fine for large borrowing to go into crypto providing it covers the interest. Once it reaches peak which was December the sell off begins and stop losses trigger for those who are to late causing a bigger crash.

I borrowed my 9 years old brother 2.5$ and then sent him 10$ in BTC !,"Hi there!

Firstly, this is my brother and he is so excited: http://i.imgur.com/OK52ErQ.jpg

I am a student in university and I have invested in bitcoin and other altcoins a big amount of money that I earned from another job. Because I am broke af for now (I have to pay a monthly loan that my family has), I borrowed my little brother 2.5$ to get out when I returned to my city of born. (my parents were not at home)

So, he was asking me for the money some days later and I proposed to send him 10$ in ""computer cash"". I told him that he would be able to access them some years later and it could have a much higher value.

He was so excited and he is asking me to give him bitcoins instead of his coins.

From now on, I will send as much bitcoins as I can for his future. Maybe I give him access to the wallet when he will be 16 years or older.

It is time for me to start teaching him about internet, bitcoin and the blockchain. It can be hard, but I would be happy if someone taught me about bitcoin when I was playing counter-strike 1.6 24/7.

This is his address: 1HowHtrCvxDXhtU369t6MVp3UdCWd4c9Z8 Donating is welcomed!",1522958746,05/04/2018 20:05:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8a313i/i_borrowed_my_9_years_old_brother_25_and_then/,0

Creating a small alarm tool to alert on price changes [Suggestions welcome],"https://i.imgur.com/U6X0njY.png


I have had this idea for a while now, so I'm finally working on it, currently the features are:

1) Add pairs from 4 different exchanges (Bitfinx, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Binance)

2) Alerts you on price above/below constantly unless u stop it

3) Price percentage change difference, this one usually is helpful when price suddenly goes up or falls, lets say we select btcusd pair and set Refresh Every to 100 secs and 1% price change, if it has increased or decreased 1% from last price in 100 seconds, it will alert u, usually helpful for an incoming pump or dump

4) If alarm is not important, we can just chill and see all prices in one screen refreshing every single second too

Suggestions are welcome

Official Robinhood Crypto vs Circle Invest Analysis and Discussion,"Hello, friends. 

I finally got access to Robinhood, so I’ll try to list the pros and cons of each and then it’d be great to hear some community feedback as well. They both offer streamlined apps, instant deposits/trades, and no commission fees. Pricing data is below, along with what the “fees” would work out to be when compared to actual market values. 

But first though, I’d like to address all the people calling these apps “scams” because you can’t withdraw your crypto to a wallet or have access to the private keys. Yet. I guess the question I’d ask is how distrusting of entities do you want to be. Admittedly, I didn’t lose anything when Mt. Gox was hacked. Or Parity, or any other exchange. So I don’t have the paranoia that many in the community have over losing their crypto. But I’ve determined that as a simple investor, I have zero use for having that kind of direct control over keys or coins. I’m ok with someone else holding them, and from what I understand both companies utilize cold storage to some degree, as well as other security protocols. Also their commission-free trading, although slightly above market price, is nothing to scoff at. Neither are their instant deposits and instant trades. If I REALLY want to transfer to an external wallet in the future, I’ll just sell for fiat and do it through another exchange. Hopefully by then both companies will have an option to do that in the app. 

Robinhood’s announcement about offering crypto was honestly what got me serious about investing. Up to that point I didn’t like exchanges in their current state, especially their fees and convoluted verification processes. I’d been strictly a traditional equity investor up until late January when I read their press release, and I finally thought I’d found a platform I could start with. I got on the waiting list immediately, hoping it would be released in February as stated. Wishful thinking, I guess. 

February came and went, and I was angry that I’d checked the app every morning for a month straight for nothing. I was so worried that I’d “miss the moon,” oh boy was I wrong. If I’d just waited until it was released, I actually could’ve saved a lot of money not chasing the dip. 

Anyway, buying experience: once you’ve been onboarded and allowed to trade crypto, it’s as simple as selecting your coin and tapping buy. You’ll be asked to enter an amount, followed by a user agreement and then in my case being told I couldn’t do a market buy and had to do a limit buy. I’m still new to this scene and unclear about the specifics of this, but just be aware that Robinhood specifies market and limit orders and may restrict which you can use, depending on how much you’re investing. I’d say overall it was a painless transaction and I started tracking my holding immediately. Graphs can be manipulated to show specific prices at certain times, and I’m sure many will appreciate the market vs limit order options. 

Circle Invest became available mid-March, and I was ecstatic about it because of my fury over Robinhood’s betrayal. If Robinhood is supposed to be a bare-bones exchange, Circle is just a bone. It’s extremely basic, doesn’t allow limit orders and its “graphs” aren’t useful for anything besides looking at the squiggly line and saying hmmm, that looks bearish. Having said that, onboarding could not have been faster or easier, and I was hodling coins less than 5 minutes after I downloaded it. 

Circle allows for $10,000 of instant deposits from your bank a week, vs Robinhood’s $1,000 a day. Circle’s prices are also higher than Robinhood’s. At the time of writing here are their prices and fees compared to the independent BitcoinAverage, which were recorded as simultaneously as possible: 

BitcoinAverage BTC price: 6778.55

Robinhood Crypto BTC list price: 6774.94
RC BTC buy price: 6784.81 (.0009% fee)
RC BTC sell price: 6761.09 (.0026% fee) 
Total fee: .0035%

Circle Invest BTC list price: 6842.52
CI BTC buy price: 6842.52 (.0094% fee)
CI BTC sell price: 6700.89 (.0116% fee) 
Total fee: .021% 

BitcoinAverage ETH price: 376.71

RC ETH list price: 377.20
RC ETH buy price: 377.86 (.0031% fee)
RC ETH sell price: 376.63 (.0002% fee)
Total fee: .0033% 

CI ETH list price: 381.31 
CI ETH buy price: 381.31 (.0122% fee) 
CI ETH sell price: 373.74 (.0079% fee)
Total fee: .0201% 

According to my recorded data, Robinhood truly has lower fees than anyone else on the market. Period. Feel free to replicate my results if they seem disingenuous, although bear in mind it’s a tad difficult to capture numbers from 3 sources simultaneously. 

Note: the first attempt to compile these numbers was cut short when I realized Circle Invest had blocked me from depositing fiat and buying/selling crypto due to my account being “under review.” From what I could tell even though they’d confirmed a withdrawal from my bank, they never actually did it and therefore I was trading with imaginary money that they didn’t actually have access to. Not my fault, clearly system error, but they locked my account. Maybe I’d been making too many buys in a short time for their taste and they wanted to check me out, but this process took much longer than expected and I wasn’t able to trade or withdraw from March 28th until April 5th, until someone finally “manually reviewed” my account after I complained. Definitely an annoyance. 

So what has your experience been with either of these platforms? Which do you prefer? Which do you think people should use? How do their prices match up with your exchange of choice? Do you think they’re both stupid because you don’t control the private keys and don’t trust anyone? Fire away! I think once these platforms release more coins and allow for wallet transfers both in and out, we have a couple winners on our hands.

But it seems no matter how much I am putting, whether I buy the dips I keep losing all my money. This sucks that all my friends are investing and get rewarded for it. However my hard earned money go to feed a whale that fixed technical analysis and used his bots to make sure all my stop losses are hit. Well I dont have any bots and I want to play fair. How does a non-whale survive in this crypto market. Ive made 6 seperate large deposits since January 7th, 1 being as recent as last week. Not 1 deposit even managed to stay above 10 percent loss. MY family whos been in stocks all their life doesnt even want to believe and thinks that its possible for such huge volotility without heavy manipulation. So how do I survive in this market? Is this market even for regular joes or is it a war of the rich with us being used as pawns paying for all whales fees and expenses?",1522962143,05/04/2018 21:02:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8a3ifb/enough_is_enough_how_do_i_outsmart_whales_in_this/,1

Stock market will go to zero.,"As recent days have clearly shown for the *n*th time, stocks are far too volatile to use as a store of value. Even solid companies' stocks will crash in the face of bad news that doesn't directly affect them.

Fraud is rampant and companies go bankrupt because of it even as management enriches itself. And the stocks have no intrinsic value -- today they are just notations in an electronic database.

Bitcoin is accepted in way more than 3 places!,"In his recent debate with Samson Mow, Roger Ver mocked Bitcoin because lightning network txs are only being utilized at three businesses around the world, including Samson's upcoming hat store (wtf!).  However, that is extremely misleading because Bitcoin is actually accepted for payment in more places than BCash. 

If you go to BCash's own ""accept bitcoin cash"" website (acceptbitcoin.cash), they list all of the places where BCH is accepted. As you scroll through the list of merchants, you'll notice that a large majority of them also accept Bitcoin. What's more, the site even highlights that Bitcoin is more popular ... ""394 out of 454 websites listed that accept Bitcoin, also accept Bitcoin Cash."" The total number of listed websites accepting BCash is 427 vs. Bitcoin's 454. So Bitcoin is more widely accepted according to their own numbers! He also says that BCash is accepted at thousands of places around the world.  427 isn't even close to 1000.

Roger purposely misconstrues/twists and conveniently selects facts in order to paint a misleading image of BCash's adoption and popularity.",1522980450,06/04/2018 02:07:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8a5sde/bitcoin_is_accepted_in_way_more_than_3_places/,1
Local Bitcoins... Did I get scammed?,"I have extremely high anxiety at the moment thinking that I could have potentially just lost $6,000 to a guy on localbitcoins. If I did, it's my own fault, and I feel like a fucking idiot. Basically I was selling $6,000 worth of btc to some guy who had a 100% positive feedback review on the site, which made me trust him. There are some major red flags here though.
His terms of the trade were that I needed to make two separate trades of 3,000 each. The first half of the payment I would send after he sent me an email showing proof of a wire transfer statement. I released the 3,000 dollars. 
He initially stated that the money would be deposited into my account after 2 days. 2 days later and it still wasn't there. Then 3, then 4, he then attributed to it possibly being because of the Easter weekend, I said fair enough. He told me that he hasn't received the money from the Bitcoin that he sold to another guy.
It has now been 8 days, but the guy basically told me yesterday that he needed to talk to his bank to get things cleared, and he was able to do so. He then told me to check my email for a message from my bank. I didn't see anything, but he said to check my spam folder, and there I saw a message from my bank that seemed legit. I still think it's weird that an important message like that from my bank would end up in my spam folder, but it looked super legit. 

Basically he changed the terms of the transaction. Now he was saying that I needed to release the second half of the btc before he could get me my money by getting it approved by his bank. I released it and then he said that that would take care of it. The email said that I would receive the funds within an hour. 

It has been 30 hours and I haven't received anything. Today I told him that and he said he would go to the bank and see what the delay was, then all of a sudden I haven't heard from him since. I just sent him a message saying that if I don't have my money within 24 hours, I am reporting him as a scammer.

Is there any possible way to get my money back in this kind of scenario. I basically went against better judgement by releasing the BTC before the money arrived in my bank, does this make me liable for the lost money?

Are there are any good resources for best practices when setting up wallets for use in an exchange?,"I'm surprised by the lack of resources on the best practices for running multiple wallet daemons for the purpose of running an exchange.  While bitcoind (and those forked from that) have an internal accounts management feature, i have a feeling they are no the most efficient way to do it.  The simplest way that comes to mind is literally jsut install each coin on its own vps instance, but that can be very costly.  I'm really just looking for any information regarding hosting wallet daemons in terms of both security and efficiency.  Feel free to throw out any links you think might be handy and ill tip you if they're useful.

A couple quick questions

* Is there any security risk in using an spv wallet like electrum?  

* Is it a smart idea to use full nodes as simply a source of information and offload the key management to a secondary server?


There's not much information on this stuff as far as i could find so i would really appreciate any information that would help maximize efficiency and user experience.

In each case seed words (bip39 24 words) or other data are kept in sealed numbered tamper evident security envelopes, for periodic inspection.

Location two contains the key to put the seed words in the proper order.

Second half of seed words in location two.

What Happened To Bitcoin: A Store of Value,"If you look at the BTC/USD chart, you see an unmistakably distinct shape. A trickling upwards leads leads to a sharply slowed exponential curve, followed by an equally steep decline. 

The amount of BTC in existence is knowable/known by the market at any particular point in time. This is really to say that we know the amount of BTC in existence is finite. 

As such, to see the shape that we see there likely at least means one thing: The rate of asset inflow into BTC must have increased. People were increasingly desiring to exchange other assets for BTC. 

But why?

Some may have liked the fact that it could be used on sites like SilkRoad. Some may have coveted the anonymity it may provide. 

But weren't we talking about the *rate* increasing? Yes. So why did the *rate* of asset inflow into BTC increase?

My hypothesis: People began to look at BTC not for its qualities as a currency, such as anonymity or ease-of-illicit-use, but *as a store of value*.

The increase came from people beginning to believe that it was a good store of value. The increase is not from increased *use* of BTC as a currency, but its use as an instrument to store value.

And what an at least initially so promising one?

But there are good reasons to doubt that its *that* anonymous, and governments are increasingly attempting to make it a financially regulated asset like any other. 

In other words, there are now serious reasons to doubt it's value as a good store of value; perhaps it's just a currency, and if so you can expect the BTC price to drop back to levels from before you see the massive inflow assets. 

However; I think BTC should embrace a path that leads to being a *store of value*.",1522988401,06/04/2018 04:20:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8a6n14/what_happened_to_bitcoin_a_store_of_value/,2

Buying stuff with Bitcoins,"Hey Guys!
I want to use my bitcoins to buy some stuff. Sadly the website i want to buy something on (gearbest) does not accept Bitcoins. What do you guys think about this website:

https://shopawl.com/

Is it legit?
This website promises that someone is going to buy the product with fiat for you and in return you give them your bitcoins.
Or do you have any tricks to pay with bitcoins without converting them into fiat and transferring them to my bank account?

"Fun fact: r/bitcoin has more people than the population of 28 countries, combined","The list of countries:

&gt;Bermuda,  Greenland,  American Samoa,  Saint Kitts and Nevis,  Northern Mariana Islands,  Marshall Islands,  Faroe Islands,  Sint Maarten,  Monaco,  Liechtenstein,  Turks and Caicos Islands,  Gibraltar,  San Marino,  British Virgin Islands,  Caribbean Netherlands,  Palau,  Cook Islands,  Anguilla,  Wallis and Futuna,  Nauru,  Tuvalu,  Saint Pierre and Miquelon,  Montserrat,  Saint Helena Ascension and Tristan da Cunha,  Falkland Islands,  Niue,  Tokelau,   Vatican City

Most of them are microstates, of course. But the number is still impressive, considering the fact that there are only about 230 countries in the world. 

Let's assume that all active Bitcoin users are on this sub, and thus there are no more than 790 tsd of Bitcoiners (an underestimate by 1-2 orders of magnitude). 

As there are more active Bitcoin users than the combined population of the aforementioned countries, it means one interesting thing:

Is it even possible to have a global cryptocurrency?,"Just thinking this through, ignoring the technical issues of individual cryptos - would it even be possible for one cryptocurrency to be widely used across the planet?

There are around 7.6 billion people in the world - say 5 billion old enough to spend money

Each bitcoin address is about 34 bytes

Each transaction has 2 address + about another 8 bytes for a value

Say people make 4 transactions a day

that means the transactional data added to a single blockchain would be 1.5 TeraBytes!

After 2 years the chain would be well over 1000 Tb and anyone running a full node would be expected to down load that each time they refresh.

That's even just a simple calculation that doesn't include any secrity - just listing the transactions. If you wanted a secure currency - then the data requirement would be massively larger!

So i guess the question is - is large scale crptyo growth even theoretically possible?

And if it isn't why are so many people making huge bets that it will become so?

"How the world will look after Bitcoin takes over, and why it is a very bright future indeed.","If you have been paying attention and have a correct understanding of monetary economics, you will have correctly concluded that Bitcoin will grow until it takes over the entire world currency market, squeezing out all competitors included fiat and gold, rendering them worthless.

Since we can know this outcome to be an inevitable certainty, let’s look ahead and consider what are the consequences inescapable hyperbitcoinization.

**The world’s first global deflationary currency**

You may have arrived at the correct conclusion that Bitcoin will end up being hoarded by everyone as it reigns supreme as a currency monopoly, but if you are also a dumbass may draw absurd and unfounded fears about deflation.  You may lie awake at night fearful of a future where people starving to death as they hold off buying food until next year when they can buy five or even ten percent more.  It is interesting to imagine a world where a currency has brought an abrupt end to human’s desire for instant gratification, but this is not how people behave.

Even today we can know that if people defer their consumption, they can increase their purchasing power through investment in risk-free assets such as US Treasuries, and yet they do not do so.  You can either conclude that this very modest intermediate step is preventing humanity from ceasing all consumption, or you can conclude that people have a much higher preference for goods and services now, rather than at some distant point in the future.   Time is deflationary.

Additionally, with a deflationary currency we can conclude that people would be incentivized to work harder with the goal of earning more money; this is a very good thing for increased productivity.  

**The eviction of rent-seeking financial leeches**

If you correctly understand Bitcoin, you would correctly conclude it will bring about the end to banks as we know them today.  Currently, our society’s method for maintaining a “secure” accounting ledger requires a great deal of resources—about 7 percent of GDP known as the financial sector.  Valuable real estate and human effort are consumed building and staffing banks in every city.  Without these resources having to be used to maintain the ledger, and are free do other constructive work and increase overall economic efficiency.  This is similar to how Netflix or Amazon’s ability to provide the function of video rental and book stores for a fraction of the cost allowed all of that real estate and labor to be redirected to other more productive activity.  Such will be the case with banks and finance as well.

From this correct conclusion, many people draw the incorrect conclusion that without banks and financing, people would be able to afford housing, cars, and education.  Housing, autos, and education are not subsidized by the banking industry; that is, the banks are not charitable organizations that contribute to cover the cost of these products.  They are rather entities that consume resources.  Without banks and lending, people as a whole could still spend the same amount of money on housing but this same amount would then go further as it no longer has cover overhead costs of the financial industry—e.g. people who buy their houses with cash, end up paying less than those that do so via financing.  

The timing of purchases would be impacted.  Without artificially low interest rates, people would likely shift their purchases and people would put money down, but people would still be buying homes and cars, albeit more efficiently.

Financing also distances the consumer from the actual cost of the product.  This is why when people buy autos or homes, they are less price conscious than they are on direct purchases, [often exceed their budget]( https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/04/03/hot-housing-market-home-buyers-spending-more-than-expected/479824002/), and are willing to pay for upgrades and features they would not otherwise purchase if they were more sensitive to their direct cost.  This is especially true in education, where people incur cost at expensive universities with nice amenities because their payment of those cost is deferred far into the future.   

In summary, humans spent money on housing and education before banks and will continue to do so after bitcoin has eliminated them and fractional reserve banking.

**Non-Bitcoin money is the root of all evil, and Bitcoin will destroy those roots and all those who rely upon them**

You may have heard the phrase “money is the root of all evil”.  I believe this is true in the sense that traditional money and control of it, is what allows the nation state to exist.  If you look at history you will see that governments always seem to have a very strong interest in controlling money and dictating to people what form of money they are required to use.  Governments do this because they receive a substantial benefit from control of the money supply.  By being able to expand the money supply via the creating of new currency units, the nation state generates a significant profit for itself—this is what is known as seigniorage, but is a rarely discussed economic term given how large this profit is.   Without seigniorage, governments would have to fund themselves entirely through taxation or debt.  This imposes financial discipline on governments and would strongly discourage or perhaps even prohibit expensive things like unpopular wars, mass incarceration, and big ineffective government programs in general.

When Bitcoin destroys the fiat currency, it kills the root on which the menacing tree of government grows.  Without control of the money supply, governments will be limited to smaller less threatening trees that are constrained by economics and market forces.  This will be a boon for peace and freedom lovers everywhere. 

**Conclusion**

Bitcoin will end banks, wars, and big government and increase economic efficiency and personal freedom.

Is there an app or website that lets you pay employees with bitcoin?,"Hey everywhere, is there an app or website that lets you pay employees with bitcoin and provides all the necessary data for the company to manage their books? 

I am thinking of creating an application at stores basic information that would allow companies to pay their employees through lightning. I was thinking employees can input their name, public address of where the money should go. For the companies(pay roll) view they will see almost like a spread sheet of information for the users that received payments through bitcoin.

Also do you think making a DAPP is the way to go or centralized app?

George Soros set to trade cryptocurrencies - Bloomberg,"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/george-soros-set-trade-cryptocurrencies-bloomberg-143403707--sector.html

(Reuters) - George Soros's $26 billion hedge fund is planning to trade cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on Friday, months after the billionaire investor called the virtual currency a bubble.

Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at the New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade digital assets in the last few months, though was yet to make a wager, the report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-06/george-soros-prepares-to-trade-cryptocurrenceis said, citing people familiar with the matter.

A Soros representative declined to comment.

The financial world has been divided about betting on bitcoin &lt;BTC=BTSP&gt;, a digital token.

Billionaire Warren Buffett and JPMorgan's &lt;JPM.N&gt; Jamie Dimon have said they will not invest in cryptocurrencies, while Wall Street banks Morgan Stanley &lt;MS.N&gt; and Goldman Sachs &lt;GS.N&gt; have been open to clearing bitcoin futures.

Last year, Soros's hedge fund took an 8.99 percent stake in Overstock.com Inc &lt;OSTK.O&gt; to become the third-largest shareholder in the online retailer. The shares of the company surged when its unit held an initial coin offering.",1523032777,06/04/2018 16:39:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ab0zh/george_soros_set_to_trade_cryptocurrencies/,1

Theories on the recent stability?,"It's only been about 8 hours or so, but for some reason, the price of bitcoin has been extremely, uncharacteristically stable, hovering around $6600.  Anyone have any theories as to why this is happening?  The only thing that I can think of is that if whales were manipulating the market or selling-off, maybe they stopped, and this is what normal bitcoin stability looks like.  I'm very curious to see if this continues over 24 hours.  If so, it might be a good sign.  Or maybe just the calm before the storm...",1523035277,06/04/2018 17:21:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8abcwt/theories_on_the_recent_stability/,2
When will LN be as simple as....,"Phone app, just like Venmo

I load the app with a few BTC that I wanna spend with

Purchase something online and QR code is shown at checkout 

Scan QR code with mobile app and instantly transfer BTC thru LN 

.... ??? It's possible right?! 


.... so bascially all the end user had to do is have the wallet that is already LN enabled, have the wallet loaded with some BTC and scan the QR code of whatever they're trying to purchase. Transaction goes though instantly. See now that's a lot more convenient than credit cards, for both buyer and seller. I'm going to Tokyo this summer and I know stores accept BTC, if transacting was this convenient then why the hell would I use my credit card or even convert cash to JPY?  If you want people to shop with BTC (admit it, 90% will be long term HODLs) that's how you do it, through convenience and mutual benefits. When BTC appreciates in price I'll have more to spend and will be more inclined to spend my savings especially if spending the BTC is very simple and convenient 

----- 


On another note, I want to create an Etsy-like online store where you can buy cool shit (modded nerf guns, drones, electric longboards, paintings, etc) and others can sell whatever they want. Payments will only be accepted through BTC and will be LN enabled. How can I find someone who will help me build that and enable BTC payments via LN....

Why are we looking at Bitcoin in $ why not Satoshi?,"I hear this a lot and wanted to get some answers, (probably the worst place to get answers lol). We look at BTC in either $ or Satoshi. For me as an investor I look strictly at satoshi’s because I believe this market will succeed in the years to come, we won’t be using $ to buy goods but Satoshi to buy goods. After tons of research about BTC there was a chart that I saw and showed, “how many satoshi’s are in one BTC?” It showed that there is a max of 100 Million Satoshi’s. Shit, If we only view things in Satoshi, I probably wouldn’t have to work ever again because 100 Million Satoshi’s would be a lot; it’s like having $100 Million in my view. This is thinking outside the box. I hope the ones that read this understand what I am trying to say, or you’re thinking “this dude must be on some good shit.” 👍

If we look at purchasing things in satoshi, an example would be “I want to buy a car for 5000 Satoshi. Or buying a car for 10,000 Satoshi.” Whatever the price is at the time. I know the fees are currently high but in the future could this be possible if we can have cheaper fees? Can we live in a world where we only buy, sell, send etc only in Satoshi? If we did, wouldn’t Fiat disappear? 

I might be living in a fairy tale but I will be holding as much as possible for as long as I can until we view buying goods only in Satoshi. I personally don’t care if this market tanks because what has been handing to us is unlike anything we have ever seen.

Didn't get to submit ID to mycelium's bitcoin purchase,"EDIT: He got a notification saying the payment will be cancelled due to technical errors.

Me and my father are new to bitcoin. He decided to buy some bitcoin from the mycelium app today. He entered in his billing details and he was apparently charged the price (65$). He went to submit ID when his phone camera emitted a file size too big. I went to help him try and compress the image. We returned to the webpage and got a ""He's dead jim message"" and he reloaded the page.

Need a serious advice: Should I take out a private loan to try to recover my money?,"Hi, Around January 7th I took out a loan against the house and I invested 12000$ in crypto and today of that 12k I have 1650$ left. I cant sleep at night. I am in a heavy depression.  I bought everything at all time high and bought shitcoins such as verge trx poet paccoin and good coins- cardano. all my coins dropped hard. verge and trx recovered but i sold at 400 satoshi respectively. My goal is to at least be at neither positive or negatively. It will be my paradise if that happens. I need someone with years of financial experience to point me in the right direction to avoid losing 300k home and not end up on the street. This is not a cry for attention. Please do not be disrespectful and inhumane because in my last thread not only did I not get an answer I got laughed at and told that I got what I deserved hoping I will end up on the street and it really hurt my feelings because like everyone of you, I just want a chance at financial freedom. I want to provide for my family and make a difference in this world. I am still relatively young and I told myself if I ever achieve my ultimate goal my next goal is to help others in need.

How can Bitcoin's transaction history be hacked?,"One of the downsides to centralized ledgers is that you must trust those who have access to them not to change them. Blockchain tech is obviously much different. I'm under the impression that for someone to change Bitcoin's transaction history they'd have to go through all of these steps:

1. Control 51% or more of the mining power.
2. Change a past transaction.
3. Change all transactions affected by that transaction, up to the present moment. This must be done faster than the rate at which new blocks are added.
4. Somehow apply the change to every node on the network?

Can anyone verify that this is exactly what would need to happen in order to change just one past transaction in Bitcoin's blockchain? Is this even possible?",1523057931,06/04/2018 23:38:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ae51x/how_can_bitcoins_transaction_history_be_hacked/,1

"Nick Szabo and Hal Finney have to be Satoshi Nakamoto, strong circumstantial proof. Does anyone remember Nick's blog comments??","Disclaimer: First, let me preface this post by saying I believe Satoshi should stay anonymous. I would never want this to be confirmed, as this is pure speculation (which is fun and what we Bitcoiners naturally do). Satoshi has created something wonderful for the world and has for the first time given us freedom and a choice of currency. He should remain anonymous if he wishes. Take this post with a grain of salt, as there is no hard evidence, only pure speculation, and conjectures. 


I've gone through the original Cypherpunks that could possibly relate to the Bitcoin project, Adam Back, Wei Dai, Hal Finney and Nick Szabo. The more research I've done, the more increasingly clear it has become that Nick Szabo either is Satoshi or part of the Satoshi team. 

Here is my circumstantial evidence:
(Due to the auto-moderator, I cannot name Nick Szabo's original project as it thinks it is a discussion not about Bitcoin, so I will refer to it as ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"".)


1. Nick Szabo has played with the idea of ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"", which is a precursor to Bitcoin. They are near identical in terms of technology and ideology. He has thought about ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" since 1998!

2. In 2005 Nick Szabo had a blog post where he asked if anyone wanted to help code up his ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" idea. Like I said, that was back in 2005! Bitcoin white paper came out in 2008! That is plenty of time for two highly intelligent computer programmers to come together and implement the idea of ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"". Perhaps Wei Dai helped with this as he is a master C++ programmer. 

3. **The comments on Nick Szabo's blog**! I was fascinated by Satoshi's identity a few years back, and I was researching Nicks blog posts. I don't know where this was exactly, and I cannot for the life of me find it again. On one of his original blog posts, they were talking about the naming of ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"". There was a user that responded to the post and commented: ""what about Bit Coin?"" This comment predated 2007, but I don't recall the exact year. I specifically remember the comment because of how they spelled Bitcoin ""Bit Coin"". I cannot find it anywhere though. Also, it appears Nick has removed comments from the blog, and retroactively changed the dates on his ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" blog posts to make it seem like it was right before the release of bitcoin December 2008, instead of 2005, when it was actually posted. On his original ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" post, Hal Finney commented on it offering a hand, and keep in mind Nick and Hal Finney have borrowed tech from each other for years. 

4. Nicks radio silence. He was so deeply involved in ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" at this point (wanting serious help to code up ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" back in 2005) he should almost have a final product by 2008. Why was Nick so silent with Bitcoins release? It implemented so many of his ideas yet he was nowhere to be seen? His work of the last 3 years is squandered by Bitcoin but he says nothing. 

5. Nick and Satoshi mentioned each other's existence very similarly. Nick only once mentioned Satoshi (before he disappeared) by saying"" Satoshi Nakamoto has
implemented BitCoin which very similarly uses a dense Byzantine fault-tolerant peer-to-peer network and and cryptographic hash chains to
ensure the integrity of a currency."" and Satoshi only mentioned Nick once. Satoshi didn't even reference ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" in the Whitepaper even though they are obviously similar. Only later did he mention Nick very briefly in one post. To me, it seems like Nick and Satoshi tried to distance themselves from each other as much as possible. Nick only briefly acknowledging satoshi so as not to seem suspicious, and Satoshi was doing the same. 

6. There was a very small group of people in the digital cash space. What are the odds that some random person that nobody knew in that very niche space created the most sophisticated digital currency out of them all that solved the Byzantine generals problem? Now, with Hal and Nick being in that niche space and seriously developing ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" since 2005, and with Nick being silent and **extremely** neutral on Bitcoin on its release and no longer interested in ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"", it seems obvious who satoshi is. Especially with Hal being the first bitcoin receiver and Nick disappearing after bitcoin releases and changing his ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" blog dates, and then well after Satoshis gone, he publicly comments on Bitcoin, and very positively at that. Why did it take him 3 years to do so? He was heavily invested in that space well before bitcoin.

Now with all of that being said, what seems more plausible? Digital cash newbie Satoshi Nakamoto comes out with this thing called Bitcoin and it blows everyone elses digital cash attempts out of the water, or Hal and Nick was developing the predecessor to Bitcoin since 2005? Nick disappears when satoshi comes around, Satoshi disappears when hal gets ALS? Nick comes back in 2011, after the waters have settled and finally positively, openly talks about Bitcoin, his own project. There are far too many coincidences and connections between these three people. It to me is obvious Satoshi was Nick and Hal. Nick comes back after the waters settled and finally talks about Bitcoin, his own project.


There is a lot more to it. This post is already too long. Nick has had a Freudian slip during a podcast, stating: ""I originally designed Bitcoin- i mean gold..."" as well. Not to mention, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto lived near Hal. To me, it seems like Hal used him as a drop (faking identity online) and controlled some or all of the Satoshi persona. Not to mention forensic analysts found similarities in Nicks and Satoshis writing-style.




TL;DR
Nick thinks of ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" in 1995, wants serious help to code it up in 2005, Hal Finney comments offering help and a user comments naming it ""Bit Coin"". 3-4 years later Bitcoin comes out, Nick Szabo is silent even though he has been seriously working on an identical idea since 2005. Hal Finney offered help with ""the predecessor to Bitcoin"" and he happens to be the first Bitcoin transaction recipient years later. Satoshi disappears when Hal is diagnosed with ALS as well, and then Nick Szabo... reappears and starts finally talking about Bitcoin officially.",1523073237,07/04/2018 03:53:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aflol/nick_szabo_and_hal_finney_have_to_be_satoshi/,3

"How I learned to short, the legend of LiveFreeOrDie","Early in 2000 I discovered Yahoo stock message boards.  It was as fun then as this sub is now,  even better in some ways.  There was this one very prolific poster who's id was LiveFreeOrDie.  This guy was super articulate, and kind of anti-authoritarian,  plus he was an obvious wall street professional of some kind.  

Mixed in with his humor and political ramblings , was an insane amount of basic insider knowledge.  A lot of it was very technical,  I'm sure many followed him just for the humor and political insight,  but a lot of people would ask follow up on technical stuff,  he'd answer some times.

LiveFreeOrDie was a defender of the practice of shorting stocks,  I don't think he shorted,  but he defended it, and explained it in detail.  

Then one day,  I lived the dream,  I cashed out ALL my Internet startup ESOP shares at ATH,  it was life changing wealth.  I quit the job at the same time,  I just put the cash in a Schwab sweep account,  and sat stunned for a few days.  Then I figured,  what the hell,  let's try day trading.  

At this point in time,  nobody else really knew the big crash was coming,  the Internet BtoC's  (pets.com etc.) were starting to falter,  but money was quickly rushing from BtoC to BtoB, (business to business,  back end,  java app servers, etc.).   Initially I was simply trying to buy low, sell high.  Then one day I f'd up,  I hit a sell order button twice.

The next day I get an email from Schwab,  it was boilerplate and kind of scolding, it said something like ""You are supposed to get approval before short selling,  next time get approved first"".  They let the transaction stand,  I was short 1,000 shares at about $54/share.  I was uncomfortable being accidentally short,  so my intention was to cover my short immediately.  

I guess the magic Internet money fairy wasn't done with me,  because that stock crashed hard the next day,  to $46,  I made $8,000 by accident.   So I've lost any fear of shorting,  I'm not working,  and the Internet bubble starts bursting,  my Internet hero promotes shorting stocks, and I've got all my internet magic money sitting in a Schwab sweep account.  Need I explain what happens next?

I start really paying attention to LiveFreeOrDie,  going back through his post history looking for info on shorting.  It was incredibly valuable in learning the short game.

Unfortunately I only lasted 6 total days of day trading/shorting.  I made money,  never made a bad trade (which was easy so I'm not tooting my own horn),  but ultimately made myself sick,  too nerve racking,  just too strange being tied to a terminal 8 hours a day,  starting at 6:00 AM.

LiveFreeOrDie continued his amazing stream of consciousness posting well into 2001,  his last post at 8:34 AM,  Sept 11,  he was never to be heard from again.  

RIP LiveFreeOrDie, love you man!

P.S.  He would of loved bitcoin!

Tested Eclair Android Lightning Wallet,"tl;dr: I completed a successful LN payment on mainnet with an old Android tablet using a random node and random service.

Process:

* Downloaded Eclair Wallet form the the Play Store on a $20 Android tablet (slow).
* Created a bitcoin wallet with a 24 word seed.
* Swiped left to see my regular bitcoin address (segwit).
* Sent funds to the wallet, and waited 6 confirmations.
* Swiped right to see the lightning wallet.
* I selected to open a channel with an Acinq node, the makers of Eclair. There are other options, like Random node, scan a node URl, paste node URl. On purpose I selected a node that has nothing to do with the service I wanted to pay to. Opening a direct channel would have been too easy.
* It started opening a channel, I could see the on chain transaction in the transaction history.
* At this point the status of the channel was orange: opening channel.
* After a few confirms the status changed to green: normal.
* At this point I was ready to make LN transactions.
* The wallet could see appr. 4000 channels.
* I tried to buy credits on bitrefill, because they have a BTC LN payment option for mainnet. They also support LTC LN too btw.
* I payed the invoice by scanning a QR code. Initially I thought the payment failed, because it took like 40 seconds or so to calculate a route and it must have been a complicated multi-hop route.
* Finally the payment completed, and I got credited with the bitrefill product instantly. I could see the LN transaction in the transaction history as paid.
* The routing fees were almost 1 cent, which is I think quite a lot for LN, but I must have used a bunch of hops to get there, which is why it took long to calculate the route initially.
* I made more tests and then, closed the channel. This created an on-chain transaction and after confirmations the remaining LN bitcoins returned to the regular bitcoin wallet without a problem.

Learnings:

* LN works as advertised, which is great news. You don't need to open a channel with the service you want to pay to directly. But if you do frequent transactions to them, it makes total sense to do so to speed up things, and to lower your fees even more.
* The speed of your device matter when it comes to calculating the optimal route. Any desktop will be ok, but slow mobile devices may not be ideal for frequent on location payments.
* Lots of hops may cause the fees to be significant, yet still extremely cheap.
* In the current Eclair for Android wallet, you can't create an invoice yet. So you will only be able to send bitcoins on LN, not receive. This of course limits the capabilities of the wallet at this point, but still great if you want to pay a service regularly very fast from your mobile device.
* You can obviously backup your bitcoin wallet seed (by writing it down), but not the LN channels. So you should not put too much funds into LN at this point with this wallet.

Generally, I'm really pleased with LN at this point. If wallets improve at this pace, within a few months we will have wallets that are ready for average people (non-geeks) to use, and we will have more and more services accepting LN bitcoins, because it's faster and safer for them then regular bitcoin transactions. It will be a very pleasant and safe experience for users.

Over the next 2 years I foresee gradual increase in demand for BTC from LN node operators who will fund large channels with the hope of collecting fees form millions of transactions.",1523119650,07/04/2018 16:47:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ajatw/tested_eclair_android_lightning_wallet/,6

Is providing LN liquidity a provably valid business model?,"Someone here argues there is no incentive to provide liquidity:

https://medium.com/failsafe/why-lightning-and-raiden-networks-will-not-work-d1880e4bc294

My gut disagrees but I'm having difficulty formulating the paradigm under which an entity is incentivized (economically) to provide liquidity. 

What would this business case look like? There is a technological costs of hardware/network resourcess to be sufficiently connected and capable of servicing many (hundreds or thousands ) channels. At some point you need to collect relay fees to cover those costs and beyond that generate profit. (for a sustainable business model) 

What does this look like, whats the break even? How to prove it?

"Poland introduces 1% use tax on cryptocurrencies, ex post facto","Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer nor tax advisor, and I may provide some false information below due to lack of knowledge.

In the early 00s a use tax called PCC (podatek od czynności cywilno-prawnych) was introduced. It was meant to be paid by the buyer if the seller was not a company, within 14 days after transaction. The rate of the tax was 1% or sometimes 2% and it was not required to pay it if the transaction was under PLN1000 (about €240). Many people didn't even know about such tax and never paid it, while MoF had better things to do than chasing someone for PLN10 (1% of PLN1000).

Some time later, it turned out that PLN1000 limit probably does not apply to virtual goods. It sucked, but it's not like MoF would go after some guy selling his Steam account.

Then cryptocurrencies came in, someone asked whether its required to pay PCC when he is trading cryptocurrencies, the answer he got suggested it is not, as it is not possible to determine whether the seller os a company or not (exchanges are just middlemans).

Last year there was a lot of confusion due to Sławomir Mentzen's post. Aside from being a tax advisor and a crypto investor himself, he is the vice-president of Wolność (Freedom) political party, led by 'The Wokest MEP' Janusz Korwin-Mikke. In the post he suggested a possibility of requirement to pay PCC from every crypto-fiat and crypto-crypto transaction.

On Wednesday, 4th of April this year MoF issued a guide on taxing cryptocurrency transactions, where they have reinterpreted the standings of cryptocurrencies against PCC law. In short, it is as bad as S. Mentzen predicted (which is why he said he now stops himself from making comments that could help MoF get more money), unless you can prove the seller was a company.

Of course reinterpretations work back in time, so technically every trader has to pay 1% of every transaction where he bought a cryptocurrency for money or other cryptocurrency.

To make things worse, every transaction has to be described on paper form (3 pages) and delivered on paper, only to be rewrotten by a bureaucrat.

To put things into perspective, someone on Facebook said he made 300000 transactions last year alone by using a trading bot. That means he now needs to spend a year filling those papers and deliver them using a truck...

Also, PCC was supposed to be paid up to 14 days after a transaction, so now a fine needs to be paid too (as almost nobody expected he has to pay PCC...). I'm not sure how big it is, but it can be made per transaction.

There is going to be a protest in Warsaw next week, unless something changes.

If that fails, many people want to go to court. Why can they win? Because while cryotocurrencies are treated as goods by income tax law, they are treated as a currecy by VAT law. So it's not that obvious how PCC should treat them.

Bitbay announced they are going to work with MoF to diffuse the situation.

It doesn't help that Russia announced 14% income tax on cryptocurrencies, while Poland has up to  32% (progressive income tax).

Some guy made a calculation - he bought crypto for PLN10,000, traded using a bot, sold everything for PLN25,000, now has PLN500,000 to pay in taxes.

I'm writing this on my phone, so please excuse typos.

Buying bitcoin underage.,"Hello,

I'm currently looking to buy bitcoin for actual purchases, not for investing. How would I be able to do this at the age of 17? Is buying bitcoin under the age of 18 legal?

I hope someone can clear me on the legality of this, but as long as I don't convert my BTC back to USD I don't need to file income taxes, right?

Edit: If legal to buy btc underage, what are some sites to buy from?

Bitcoin vs Gold. It really is this simple.,"Gold: 

Monetry value = scarce, fungible, decent medium of exchange, potential unit of account.

Utility value = good at making physical jewlery (malleable)

Bitcoin:

Monetary value = scarce, fungible, excellent medium of exchange, potential unit of account.

Utility value = ability to record data in a global immutable encodable ledger (single source of truth)

For the people who understand golds potential but discount bitcoins. Realise that in an increasingly globalised and digital world, immutable uncorruptable record keeping is much more valuable than the ability to make jewlery.",1523168451,08/04/2018 06:20:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ao9fk/bitcoin_vs_gold_it_really_is_this_simple/,1

Help me understand something about Bitcoin,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think my understanding of the ""blockchain"" clicked when I heard the phrase, ""you can't have blockchain without Bitcoin."" Am I correct in asserting that you can't have the desirable properties of immutability, censorship resistance, security, neutrality, etc without the proper incentive mechanisms? As I understand it, the security of ""blockchains"" comes from distributed users across the network who participate by virtue of self-benefiting motives. Can it be said that without the self-incentivised motives, there is no valuable blockchain? 

As in, if you change any of the ingredients:  cryptography + protocols + Free and Open Source Software + PoW + economics (incentives/game theory), you get something different from Bitcoin. Does each and every variation of blockchain become useless when you take economic incentives out?

If so, why do I hear people talking about using blockchain for supply-chain management or improving transparency in government spending? What incentive mechanism are there to keep the ledger distributed? Will a soft, non-economic incentive such as, ""I want to enforce my government to spend responsibly, therefore I'll spin up the government ledger node/miner"" work? 

Then I see promising projects like [Democracy.Earth](https://www.democracy.earth/) who are trying to figure out liquid democracy. Will reputation and social systems like Proof of Identity and Attention Mining as described by their whitepaper work without hard economic motives?

Will appreciate the discussion, thanks in advance.

Edit: follow up question that I have weak understanding of: if Rootstock runs seamlessly and we are able to port over any Solidity written program and build smart contracts that are 2 way pegged to Bitcoin, I would assume people would build on top of the most secure network.

The problem with international wire transfers is far greater than just waiting 3 to 5 business days,"The biggest and most overlooked problem with international wire transfers is not usually the time of 3-5 business days (which is a joke in the age of the internet) as for some reason people have become accustomed to this over time. 

The bigger problem is the fact that once you initiate the transfer it dissapears from your bank and floats around the world through many correspondant banks. During this time neither you or your bank has any idea where your money is or when it will arrive. And if you need to know this info then you need to pay your bank a huge fee to trace this for you. You will only know the money has arrived once the person you sent the money to informs you it has arrived. You also never know the amount of fees that will be deducted along the way making it impossible to know the exact amount of money that will arrive in the recipients account. 

This part in and of itself is the biggest joke and a far greater problem than the transfer time alone.",1523170773,08/04/2018 06:59:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aoeu9/the_problem_with_international_wire_transfers_is/,6

"Bitcoin prices plummeted, still adhere to the ""mining"" are what?","In the past 2017, block chain has become a hot topic for everyone to discuss. Mining has also become a popular hot topic for many people. Even in the various sectors of the elite, gold powder are transformed into bitcoin miners"". But in the past year, bitcoin and other digital currencies have experienced several ups and downs. Today we have to talk about these still adhere to the ""mining"" are what?

To this end, we see there are too many people at all to ""dig"", become ""miners"". 

AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactionsThey spend a lot of money to buy equipment such as miners, graphics cards, and pay high electricity and later maintenance costs, so as to dig out bitcoins. The standard of deciding whether they will succeed or not is the price of bitcoin.

But what is so overwhelming is that no one can be sure what the established rule of bitcoin price is. Before that, bitcoin prices rose all the way, and even reached 20000 dollars, making all investors crazy. But then all the way down, the lowest price has been less than 7000 U.S. dollars, which has shrunk 2/3 directly, which is much more than that of the stock market. Compared with those who are at a loss, the miners seem to be able to settle down. Though they earn so little, they can still maintain their lives.

How to Defend Yourself Against Pump-and-Dump Crypto Scams,,1523196803,08/04/2018 14:13:23,http://www.b2s.pm/ULOwpi,1
Thank you “ central bank of India”( RBI )- For saving crypto currency: ( long post - please read through),"-incentives matter and ideas have consequences:
 
The centralized exchanges were a big threat to ownership of crypto assets as they gave the government complete access to data of customer holdings through their KYC requirements.

The unintended consequence of banning these exchanges by the central bank has incentivized people to move to decentralized exchanges like Bisq. Profit motive and human ingenuity will iron out whatever little problems exist in trading on such exchanges in time.

In a single stroke of stupidity a beurocrat has moved the government from having full access to crypto asset ownership data to zero knowledge in the future.

Thank you very much RBI for helping us achieve this!",1523197210,08/04/2018 14:20:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aq78o/thank_you_central_bank_of_india_rbi_for_saving/,2

Help please guys..,Ive recently taken the plunge got into Bitcoin. Only been buying small bits. £25/£50 a go. I can't use a card as I never have funds in there long enough. Don't trust PayPal. I normally use my phone bill for things and just pay it off at the end of the month. I'd found one way using Mmoga and then a site called cryptovoucher.io but today I've been unable to buy any whatsoever. I'm struggling to find a way to purchase any amount with sms/phone bills other than this. Coingate keeps coming up but I'm unsure on them. Wanting all my passport info and things and there's little reviews about. Anyone got any ideas where to try? I'm  UK bassed aswell.,1523204272,08/04/2018 16:17:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aqyiz/help_please_guys/,0

Merchants seeking wealthy customers should offer a discount for BTC,"There are thousands of hodlers who are truly wealthy. But they won't spend because there's no incentive to do so.

Offering a discount to fiat would be an incentive. 

Who would bother? A merchant offering luxury goods. Think of a jewelry store, or a high end travel agency, and ask yourself if they would love access to a new class of high net worth customers.

But why would they eat the discount? Because margins on luxury goods are high anyway. They have the leeway to offer it. New sales are what they're after, because there are only so many customers at that level. Access to new high-end customers would be a thing any luxury merchant would strive for.

Same goes for makers of luxury goods. They should absolutely accept BTC from their retailers to purchase inventory. It's the coin of the land.

The Bitcoin community is egalitarian by nature, so we're not accustomed to thinking like this. But the key to adoption lies in incentives and education. Wealthy hodlers have the education. They need an incentive.

Getting coffee shops to accept crypto is a waste of time. Offering the right goods, to the right buyers, in the right currency - that's what will drive adoption.",1523205039,08/04/2018 16:30:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ar1kr/merchants_seeking_wealthy_customers_should_offer/,0

"Expect the unexpected, because the only thing you can know for sure is that you know nothing for sure","We find it hard to imagine that things will ever go wrong when they are going well. That's what happened at the end of last year.

Explain how LN is NOT an alt coin,"I don’t mind being wrong but please explain how this follow sentence is still Bitcoin.

Deposit USD to savings account (address) at the bank (Bitcoin network) to pay a merchant with VISA (Lightning Network) by exchanging USD (Bitcoin) for VISA credits (LN Coin), which creates a debt obligation that will be settled once USD is received (channel closed).

 Bitcoin for me is censorship resistant money not controlled by any group. This, to me, is no longer that. 

The counter argument is “you don’t have to use LN”, but if the cost to transact on layer 1 increases then I am forced to use LN or leave the network.

Thoughts on asic resistance PoW; centralized hashrate,"Monero recent changed its proof of work to be asic resistant, which caused Bitmain's cryptonote miners to stop functioning when mining Monero.

The resultant total hashrate drop (early indications are &gt;70%) makes it appear, until yesterday, Bitmain would have been able to perform a successful 51% attack on the Monero network.

Could BTC be similarly vulnerable at this very moment?


If your primarily interest in crypto is creating sound money, you are likely to favor (rotating) asic-resistant proof-of-work algorithms.

If you are in it to mine for short term profit, you probably favor whatever algorithm you can mine fastest, I guess?",1523232883,09/04/2018 00:14:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aub0s/thoughts_on_asic_resistance_pow_centralized/,2

Remember this little fun fact..,"With big names like Soros, Rockefeller and other large traditional hedge funds now eyeing the crypto market with internal approval to trade.

Remember this little fun fact.

At this price level, if you short the market the maximum gains are capped at 100%, while if you go long the maximum gains are infinite because no one knows how high the crypto market can go. 

Even if the price of BTC went back to $20k thats 250% to 300% return from this point, and everyone knows if we get back to $20k we will go a lot higher.

So after bitcoin has already experienced a 65% decline in price this year it makes absolutely no sense to try and short an extremely limited market when you can go long a potentially unlimited market.

These big names in finance are not looking to short, they are waiting and getting ready to buy in at the bottom then ride this next wave up.

Remember Soros' short trade on the British Pound? He pocketed $1 billion in profit from the Pound crashing. these guys are not here to kill bitcoin and save fiat, they are here to make as much money as possible, and at this point in time they will accomplish that by buying low then driving the bitcoin market to insane heights.

To those who are selling at this point, thats fine, but just realise you will be selling your coveted coins to these big players who will happily take them from you at this level.",1523257353,09/04/2018 07:02:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8awkcd/remember_this_little_fun_fact/,7

"At present, bitcoin fever has dropped 80% compared with last year's peak.","As we all know, no matter how the economic development is, the number of French currency in each country will only increase, but the degree of self-restraint of each national central bank is different. AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions. But the number of bitcoins is permanently fixed, and there will be a loss of private keys that will cause bitcoin never to come back, which is equivalent to reducing the number of bitcoins, so its price is always rising in the long term relative to French currency.

Of course, the rise in the price of different legal currencies is also different, which is directly proportional to the inflation of different legal currencies. The number of dollar prints is much higher than that of dollar denominated bitcoins, and the price of Renminbi is much more than that of RMB denominated bitcoin.

Many people do not understand why bitcoins have risen tens of thousands of times since the birth of 09 years. From a single point of view, the reason is very simple, that is, there are too many French coins in the world. Not bitcoin bubble, but the bubble world currency. Conversely, the world currency bubble more serious, bitcoin bubble is bigger. AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions. It is the currency bubble first, bitcoin bubble after bubble is Fiat determines bitcoin bubble.

For example, in Venezuela, in order to escape the ransacking of heavy inflation, the people have just started to rush to buy gold and US dollars, but they have been hit by the government, and the people turn to buy digital currencies such as bitcoin.

Will Bitcoin be a long-term solution for Venezuela's economy?,"🇻🇪
Venezuela, the country with the highest inflation rate in the world, with a non-existence decentralize currency, has struggled to obtain cash to finance their daily needs leading to starvation of the general population. 
The socialist nation saw a fall in oil prices, throwing the entire economy into disorder. Experts predict that Venezuelan's inflation could go as high as 1,600%.
No wonder the awareness of Venezuelans in the consequences of government-funded and supported banking and financial systems. There's an arguable irresponsible monopoly in charge of their currency where a bright solution comes in a digital form.
Bitcoin has gradually changed the mindset of the global population, and Venezuelans are the ones who could benefit directly with the ability to gain control of their money and obtain financial freedom from their government.
The rising demand and interest in bitcoin in Venezuela also make the possibility of the replacement of national currency with a digital store of value, that's where ""Petro"" came to play.
Petro, here's the Wikipedia definition ""Announced in December 2017, it is claimed to be backed by the country's oil and mineral reserves, and it is intended to supplement Venezuela's plummeting bolívar fuerte currency, purportedly as a means of circumventing U.S. sanctions and accessing international financing.""
(the entire link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_(cryptocurrency)

Petro has been everywhere on state TV and government-run social media, promoting its benefits. There's even a catchy Twitter hashtag #PetroParaVencer, (“Petro to conquer”) which has been regularly used by politicians and government Twitter accounts.

Ok, so what has happened with Petro so far?
Declared as unconstitutional, one of Venezuela's two opposing lawmaking bodies using hard rhetoric has denounced the project as not only a fraud but a threat to potential investors.

What's next for Venezuela? The same body declared: ""This deepens the crisis that we are living in. The PTR is another [example] of corruption, and we will come out of this crisis with measures that we have announced from this Parliament.""

What's your view on Venezuela's faith?",1523265904,09/04/2018 09:25:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ax5b9/will_bitcoin_be_a_longterm_solution_for/,4

-Price in 14 leading fiat (national) currencies (EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY...)

-Market cap in regard to price and supply

-Trading volume in last 24h

-Circulating supply and total supply

And other important info.



**CryptoIndex.co was made because:**

1.We wanted a clean, mobile responsive site where we can find, calculate... all the info we needed.

2.We are large crypto enthusiasts and wanted to contribute to this great movement.

3.We are also more then happy to be able to help the crypto community and new users get all the info they need on one place.

4.We think contribution is important for adoption. (If you help someone understand how cryptocurrencies work, you are helping yourself) ;)


CryptoIndex.co is free to use for everybody who likes it. ( if he/she likes it of course :) )


If the community has any suggestions on how to improve they'r user experience and make CryptoIndex.co better and more useful, please feel free to suggest.

Bag holders are getting desperate. [Focused Discussion],"This is just my opinion on the current market situation. I feel as if everytime btc shows signs of recovery it gets knocked down over and over. The bag holders can only hold out for so long, if this continues we will be in a multi year bear market. Once the bag holders sell along with the manipulative whales we will see a crash like never before. I hope it doesn't come to this but that's the way it is looking right now in my view.

Tinfoil hat theory: Soros is trying to get in before the next stock market crash,"Bitcoin was at least in part something that came out the 2008 crisis.  Crypto has never seen an economic crisis yet but if you've been paying attention to the stock market the past couple months it looks like we might be in for another crash. Crashes almost always happen in 8 year cycles and it's been 10 so we are long over due.

Normally I would presume that this bubble was like all the others and the price will slide down for several years before the next bubble. However a stock crash could be a black swan event for bitcoin causing the true mega bubble and from the ashes of this coming economic shitstorm bitcoin and blockchain will rise.

Given the scandals around elections and companies like Cambridge analytica harnessing user data and using sockpuppets to influence the outcome of elections, I view it as highly likely that powerful people are using the same tools in the cryptosphere to influence the market or will in the near future.

A lot of people I've noticed (including myself) presumed that with the recent Soros news that he must already have bought in otherwise why would he tell everyone and risk exciting the market forcing him to buy higher? Well maybe his firms have used analytics and determined there is a lot of negative sentiment towards him and so it's a false flag, for lack of a better term. He actually hasn't bought in and is genuinely waiting. And this news was an attempt to scare the crypto market down lower because as many redditors have commented ""soros crashed the Bank of England and is going to do the same for bitcoin!"" So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

So Soros(or his firm) are getting itchy fingers because it looks like stocks are going to plummet, given that **the entire crypto market is less than 1% of global GDP**a market that it is going to essentially replace I might add, there is still a ton of room for growth. So moving from stocks into bitcoin right before this crash could be the trade of the century.

Perhaps that could even explain the movements we saw today.",1523289069,09/04/2018 15:51:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8azgjp/tinfoil_hat_theory_soros_is_trying_to_get_in/,3

Extending BTC's value as power,"We all know that btc has value, but what if it had its intrinsic value increased? 

Proposal:
Introduce a smart contract voting record for bitcoin. 1 satoshi=1 vote. The voting power can be delegated (and undelegated) to any other address. Those addresses can further redelegate their votes. 

When a btc is sent to another btc address, all delegated power that the btc is linked to is removed. so, for example you have 100 sat, all delegated between 3 entities in a 2/2/4 balance. You send 21 sat to another address. The remaining sat on your account is redelegated in a 2/2/4 balance with the remainder given to a random delegate. 

So, what can this do? 
Let's say we delegate our voting power to someone we view as trustworthy. For example, we delegate our voting power to vitalik buterin. Vitalik then can sign a statement with our voting power. It gives weight to the signature. We can of course revoke the voting power, but with this system bitcoin's intrinsic value of being a system that is the best monetary system in the world now is extended with a form of political power associated with the simple ownership of bitcoin. 

Now, lets say a government then uses this for polling. They can easily gauge what their citizens think, weighted by how much btc each citizen has. 

Suddenly, btc now gains more intrinsic value because activists need more for votes. Who delegates what becomes a thing. 

Can you see a major news network running headlines like ""president such and such forced to label bitcoin as national currency by delegation power of the bitcoin community"" etc. That is what happens when you extend bitcoin with additional powers that are unlocked through ownership of a bitcoin.",1523291805,09/04/2018 16:36:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aztu7/extending_btcs_value_as_power/,1

Does anyone have a good way of refuting the argument that large nodes means that LN is banking 2.0.",1523300426,09/04/2018 19:00:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b0zqk/large_well_funded_ln_nodes_centralization/,1

What is with the silence here on the biggest issue right now and that is Bitmain and ASICs,"All the major crypto reddits are having a valid discussion on the ASIC miner issue.  Its very evident at this point that Bitmain controls probably close to 70% of hashing in Bitcoin, and has done it in other networks.

The current situation is extremely dangerous for Bitcoin.

I believe this year Bitcoin may need to deal with mining decentralization and if we do not it will be difficult to expect anything positive going forward.

Continuing to build Bitcoin on the back of Bitmain is not a viable strategy and it will not end well.

The Loneliness of the Bitcoin Blogger,"An [often heard criticism](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/blockchain-as-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem/) amongst bitcoin sceptics is bitcoin blockchain is a solution without a problem.

Another often heard claim amongst bitcoiners – or maximalists – is that when they think they understand bitcoin, [they realise they don’t](https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/829421449760866304/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftropyc.co%2Fpages%2Fnews%2Fblockchain-cryptocurrency-paradigm-shift).

I know I’ve experienced this myself. Especially after reading this recent blog submission from the fabulous ‘Juice’; [Why the World Doesn’t Understand Bitcoin Yet](https://medium.com/@rextar4444/what-no-one-in-the-world-understands-about-bitcoin-yet-52cc8df89f3e).

It’s strange: it seems the inevitability of a bitcoin blogger becomes speaking to oneself, regardless of listeners. A proposition where the premise is not explicitly stated.

Soliloquy which becomes enthymeme.

A new language in creation.

Bitcoin Purchases and Withdrawls at Convenience Stores with Lottery Machines and Bitcoin Powerball Type Lottery?,"There are over 120k convenience stores in the United States.  I believe that bitcoin atms are a good idea but they might be too complicated to go mainstream.  

Today if someone wants to play a lottery and pre-pick their numbers they fill out a slip at a store and then a machine reads the details on that slip and automatically prints out their numbers.  With technology like that it might be possible for customers to write in a bitcoin address to make a bitcoin purchase.  The merchant would then put the slip into the machine and it would print out relevant details on their ""ticket"".  

The customer wouldn't nessicarily even have to have a bitcoin address to buy and store bitcoin.  The machine could randomly assign customers an address and the ticket could act as confirmation of how much btc that a customer owns and how to access their address if they choose to do so.  It could also allow them to cash out in fiat for whatever the current value of their bitcoin is in fiat.  If the value of their coin had risen beyond the maximum fiat cashout amount the customer could do a partial sale and then get a new ticket that showed their remaining balance.

I also think that state lotteries could add scratch tickets and drawings that paid bitcoin instead of cash.  ",1523316393,09/04/2018 23:26:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b30tx/bitcoin_purchases_and_withdrawls_at_convenience/,0

Why Croatia is friendly to Bitcoin?,"According to some estimates (for example look here) Croatian crypto-community has reached twenty five thousands users at the beginning of 2018, which constitutes more than 0.6% of country's four million inhabitants. At the same time, some sources indicate that there are now about twenty five million block-chain wallets users globally, which is less than 0.3% of world's population.

With Croatia doubling world's crypto-users average Croatian National Bank (CNB) takes a relatively relax, thoughtful stance on (how CNB calls it) ""E-money"", which contrasts sharply with sometimes frantically hostile approach to this issue demonstrated by many Eastern European financial watchdogs. Still, Croatian Kuna (HRV), which has been devalued against UDS for about 50% since 2008, is the only legal tender in the country. Being technically legal, Bitcoin and other crypto have remained largely outside of the Croatian regulation framework and are now defined as ""virtual currency scheme"", similar to Linden dollars used in the Second Life' avatars commercial interactions.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: moderately friendly;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: EU;
industries to focus: e-commerce, FinTech, entertainment, marketplace, tourism;
major limitations: difficult regulatory environment, small size of internal market;
opportunities: educated workforce, relatively high for Eastern EU country per-capita (almost $12.5 thousands).
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (positive).

I refill from Cash phone app and CoPay wallet. Cash seems to charge about 1.3% on buying BTC, then nothing to withdraw to CoPay. I need to do the CoPay hop to support BIP70. I haven't checked if there's a similar 1.3% loss converting from CoPay to BitPay card balance. I don't think so. The BTC fees are next to nothing and confirmations seem fast.

It feels good to use cryptocurrency for daily purchases. I'll continue for a month or so until I get bored and then try it using a different coin technology.

Bitcoin's Monetary Policy is the cause of price swings,"First to state the obvious: Bitcoin's price volatility prevents widespread adoption by merchants and other risk averse people, with cost to hedge and uncertainty about the near-term value turning people away.

Now for my unpopular opinion: This is built right into Bitcoin's monetary policy (steady, unchanging supply schedule, with a cap on total coins). I don't see how widespread adoption can happen when more stable alternatives already exist (gold / fiat) and it is possible to have an ""economically stable"" monetary policy.

How to create an economically stable monetary policy: Tie the maximum block subsidy to the difficulty level. When difficulty goes up, the subsidy increases commensurately, and decreases when difficulty reduces. If demand for the coin increases, miners see higher profitability and devote more energy to mining the coin, increasing the number of coins on the market and diluting the price. When demand for the coin reduces, the opposite effect occurs and miners produce less coins which supports the price. The key here is to make sure the coins per block goes up or down in line with difficulty (10% increase in difficulty = 10% more coins). As it is tied to a verifiable cost (energy spent), this prevents run-away inflation and keeps to the principle of sound money. We can then conceptualise the blockchain as an accounting system that credits users based on their energy input to the system.

Keeping transaction fees deflationary: The above idea ignores the impact of transaction fees, but we can easily accommodate them by making the block subsidy even more dynamic: reducing the subsidy by a historical average of transaction fees per block. Otherwise transaction fees would be inflationary as they would encourage miners to increase their output and therefore the number of coins on the market.

Apologies for the long post, but I'm fully signed up to the bitcoin idea and see this wild price speculation/ panic as a major hurdle for the eco-system. I know speculation for personal gain is what got everyone interested in the first place, I just think it prevents wider use and is easily (technically, not politically / socially) dealt with by applying some basic economic principles.

Why it is Mathematically Impossible for Bitcoin to be at the end of a Bubble Cycle,"A typical bubble occurs when a group of investors are too invested in an asset class and then decide to flee that asset en-mass with most not returning.  

The recent drop in Bitcoin is deceptive because it has most of the hallmarks of a bubble bursting.  Even the charts look practically identical to a classic bubble in economic theory.

The major difference between bitcoin today and those other bubbles is that the number of wallets and users has not peaked yet.

During the real estate bubble, for instance, almost all available buyers were maxed out into the market.  And even though the real estate bubble was significant by historical standards house prices didn't go to zero.  They have since fully recovered and are actually above their peak levels in the United States.

At the beginning of the downswing in prices Coinbase was opening between 40-100k thousand accounts per day.  Although we don't have the exact numbers those numbers are definitely still increasing.

LocalBitcoins for instance is still doing 80 million dollars per week in bitcoin sales.  During the peak in December the number was about 130 million.

If Coinbase by itself at 15 percent of the market is adding say 300k users per month presently, it wouldn't be crazy to conclude that the entire world is adding 700k-1mil users per month at exchanges etc.

Bitcoin by nature is a limited resource.  Every day more and more people are trying to buy that limited resource.  Even if they eventually sell, the first natural action of a new Coinbase user is to buy Bitcoin.  In order to sell Bitcoin they have to have bought it first unless they already had it.

My point is that I too thought that we were in a catastrophic bubble where prices would go to 100 dollars per coin.  But after looking at the growth in the number of people involved it became obvious that the reason for the recent market drop was because of how quickly prices had increased.  

People who bought at $300 in 2013 and still had coin would be sort of irrational if they didn't take advantage of the ability to cash out their investment.  

It would be a huge mistake for people to look at the market and give up on Bitcoin.  Price movement is inevitable in situations where people have made millions of dollars quickly.  But as the amount of networks increase that are connected to and that are linked to bitcoin in some way, the more fractional individual ownership of the coins will become and the less influence any one person will be able to have on the market.

Bitcoin is just a way for people to store their money online.    Old people used to hide it under the mattress today they hide it on a piece of paper somewhere.  ",1523336499,10/04/2018 05:01:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b55ev/why_it_is_mathematically_impossible_for_bitcoin/,9

Shower thought,"With this recent US tax nightmare currently underway because crypto to crypto trades are taxed CGT now, leaving a lot of people with taxes due and no cash to pay it. Wouldn't this effectively scare a lot of new potential investors into just sticking with bitcoin during the next run up. 

Like who needs the accounting, recording and documenting headaches along with those potential tax consequences that can occour just from volatile market movements. Mum and pop investors definitely do NOT.

I have a feeling these new tax laws in the US and globally will have the effect of incentivising people to just stick with bitcoin and not mess around at all with alts.

Two hours by 6% bitcoin back below $7000,"Some analysts believe that the decline of bitcoin is related to the US tax deadline this month. Thomas Lee (Thomas Lee), a research director at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said in a research report last week that American families may be in arrears of $25 billion in capital gains taxes because of holding encrypted money. In order to pay tax obligations, investors are selling bitcoin, which means they will sell the encrypted currency sharply before the April deadline for the tax returns next week to change the dollar.

"Quick question about buying over time and tax from the moment you go back to USD, a portion of your total BTC holding","If this is in the wrong place, please let me know and I'll move it(to where).

My question is this:

Say for the sake of a simple example, you have two purchases:

&gt;04-05-2017 0.07 BTC @ $1,134.07 total paid $79.39 $fee $1.29 spent-kept money $78.10

&gt;04-08-2017 0.06 BTC @ $1,196.71 total paid $71.80 fee $0.40 spent-kept money $71.40

Total you have 0.13 BTC average paid $74.75 (based on spent-kept sum and divided by 2 purchases)

Then you later cash out $5.00 worth from your total BTC holding that you bought at different prices. 
At this particular time that you cash out, BTC is worth $1,184.71 -&gt; 0.0042204 BTC

What do I do here?

Average the costs that I bought bitcoin at and compare against that current price eg. $1165.39 vs. $1184.71

edit:

Or maybe I should take the total balance I have at the time in BTC, multiply that with the current value of BTC at the time, and subtract against that what I take out in USD. Ahhh man this is confusing. I think it's a matter of percentage eg. how much you bought at one time for what price, then average it. If one of the two purchases is double in value of the other purchase, and this double in value is more than what you cashed out for, that is a gain but with a 66&gt;33 split (whatever 2/3 is) where 66 is the higher value... ahh",1523343791,10/04/2018 07:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b5pxz/quick_question_about_buying_over_time_and_tax/,1

"LN scenario, question","A has a channel to B
B wants to buy something in a store, and opens a channel to C

A can now use B's channel to C, and empty his part of the channel, making B have to open another channel.

Is the solution here to assume that A will eventually make another route to C, that B can route back to? Or does B have to refund their channel to C? How will this work with high network traffic? Here B has no control over channel states, and would lose utility because of A's use.

How will these problems be solved? Without increasing the blocksize, I don't really see refunding channels all the time as a solution, as fees can get absurdly high, depending on network activity.",1523345129,10/04/2018 07:25:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b5tiy/ln_scenario_question/,0

Advocates hail the tech as the answer to many business problems. And a growing number of organizations are sprinting to embrace the trend and explore a whole plethora of blockchain technology applications. So, if you are not educating yourself on how to use blockchain for business, you may soon find yourself trailing behind your competitors, because they surely are.

Looking to get transaction history of multiple addresses in one place and export to csv?,"Hello, does anyone know of any block explorers where I can list multiple addresses at the same time? I have an HD wallet and have gone through loads of addresses, I'm looking for a complete list of all transactions (including to each other) in one place.

I'd then want to export to csv as well.

I have electrum but their export function does not include the addresses, only the transaction hashes. It would take me ages to manually get the addresses for each hash.

"Indian Police Officers Implicated in Bitcoin Abduction, Extortion Crimes","An Indian Police department has accused 10 of its own policemen for a number of crimes including kidnapping and extortion in a scheme that involved 200 bitcoins, approx. $1.35 million in current prices.

The Crime Investigation Department \(CID\) of the west\-Indian state of Gujarat has filed a preliminary FIR \(First Information Report\) to start proceedings of an investigation against 11 individuals including 10 policemen for allegedly kidnapping and forcing a wealthy civilian businessman, who trades bitcoin, to hand over 200 bitcoins in an extortion scheme.

According to [the Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bitcoin-extortion-by-policemen/article23484620.ece), the police department booked charges after receiving a complaint from Shailesh Bhatt, the victim. In it, Bhatt alleges police inspector Anant Patel and nine of his subordinate constables of using three police vehicles to abduct him, his business partner and his driver to a remote farm, detained and then beaten into transferring 200 bitcoins to the inspector. The trio f victims were released later.

An early investigation has, thus far, not been able to verify if the bitcoins were transferred from the victim to the accused police inspector, according to CID director general Ashish Bhatia, speaking to the [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/money-for-nothing-cops-extortion-for-free/articleshow/63672907.cms). The official also announced the formation of a special investigative unit to look into the case.",1523356588,10/04/2018 10:36:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b6mmf/indian_police_officers_implicated_in_bitcoin/,3

New tool: AI powered crypto calendar. I need your feedback.,"**Hi fellow Redditors!**

**Today** I am launching the beta to a product I've been working on for several months now and put a lot of hours into. I hope it is received well by the community as I realise the only way to grow this product to something successful is with your help! I am looking for all feedback, positive or negative, your opinions really matter to me as this is a long term project that I am eventually hoping to turn in to a business. If you wouldn't use this product, please take a second to tell me why not, or what I could do to improve it enough that would make you more interested.

Eventually I plan to monetise the site with a subscription model with extra features for paying users. For those of you who provide feedback, I will give a month free membership (if you pm me your email address) when the subscription service starts.

www.haystack.news is an AI powered calendar with upcoming news and events related to the crypto industry. Our goal is to help traders maximise profits by helping plan ahead.

There are currently over 400 entries related to the future and I am building on those numbers at a rapid pace.

**Roadmap for the coming months:**

- Auto detection of articles for what coin they may relate to and show icon to quickly show visually what the article is in relation to
- Community driven submissions (not just AI)
- Analytics and interactions on each article such as views, shares and the ability to comment
- Add any article to your personal calendar
- Build up more news sources to find more events. (If you have suggestions for good sources, please let me know)
- Update design / algorithm based on user feedback!

I will answer every question I can, please don't be afraid to ask!",1523365430,10/04/2018 13:03:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b7fyc/new_tool_ai_powered_crypto_calendar_i_need_your/,2

Looking for a crypto exchange that supports my requirements,"I'm looking for a crypto exchange with any of the following capabilities: 

1 It has no requirements for a user account. E.g. shapeshift.io has this capability. Does anyone know of any others?

2 It has an API to create a user account (if possible without submission of scans of ID documents).

3 It has an API to retrieve all the information to perform a fiat deposit. E.g if I initiate a fiat deposit on a regular exchange I receive a code to insert in the transaction description so that the funds will be redirected to your account. I would like to obtain such a code, and the other information required for making a wire transfer (target financial institution etc) via an API.

I've been searching for a while, without much success. If you know of an exchange that supports only a part of these capabilities, please let me know.",1523372214,10/04/2018 14:56:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b853r/looking_for_a_crypto_exchange_that_supports_my/,0

Need help with Multibit Classic wallet files,"Hey all,

Friend is requesting help getting access to some BTC he forgot he had.

He used Multbit Classic wallet back in 2013/2014. All he has are a bunch of .wallet files for some reason, his BTC address and a 50-character password labelled ""Bitcoin wallet"" that he found in his password manager (it's not 64 characters so I assume this can't be the private key so I'm not sure if it was used for Multibit - I never used the wallet myself). Tried downloading the multibit classic wallet but says I need to install a legacy version of Java. Will get around to that later but was wondering if there was anything else I could do in the meantime?

Does Kazakhstan ready to outlaw Bitcoin?,"Kazakh financial authorities have come a long way before reaching a point when they are ready to regulate Bitcoin and its family members out of existence. At the end of March 2018 the chief representative of the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) alluded in one of his public speeches on the upcoming complete ban of crypto-trade in the country.

It's difficult to say, however, that it had been an unexpected surprise for a local crypto-community. Already in October 2017 NBK put forward a proposition to restrict the local use of crypto-currencies. It was also accompanied by a promise to outlaw Bitcoin mining. Even earlier, in 2014, the same bank's officials deemed local financial institutions' use of Bitcoins illegal. After so many belligerent declarations, broadcast by country's top monetary watchdogs, it had already became very difficult to believe into the bright future of crypto in this Central Asian country.

Although those types of strong anti-crypto sentiments have already became one of the leading characteristics of financial gatekeepers populating this particular region of the world, it's, still, very sad to recognize that one of the most technologically advanced Central Asian nation, which had seen the first Bitcoin terminal installed in its capital city Almaty as early as in August 2016 and, prior to that, Kazakh government backed crypto-currency announced in March, is now reverting its steps back to the past.

BTC to hit 15k again? Or nah.,"Ive been a long down holder but id like my current investment to double in price. What are my odds? 

I hear all these hodl calls, but what makes anyone think  it will raise? Other than hope (I feel there is alot of optimism due to people's level of investment)

Banks seem to be cracking down (and maybe controlling the market?), Governments are tightening regulations. General public is losing interest. 
Development has been slow. 

I understand the December bull run was largely due to the media attention gained. Now that all the Nov/Dec/Jan investments have lost half their value, I don't see a media frenzy spiking the charts again in the same way. 

Give a man some hope! 

Edit: 'people' to 'general public' to be more specific

Gresham's Law..,"Greshams law basically states ""bad money drives out good"". Meaning when two types of currency/money are used in circulation together the bad money is naturally spent first and the good money is kept/saved/hoarded.

This is a natural phenomenon that has been happening again and again throughout history. From gold coins vs copper coins in ancient Rome, to the pre 1960s silver penny vs the post 1960s nickel plated penny.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to spend fiat and hoard bitcoin until fiat is no longer in circulation. This is a very natural phenomenon that cannot be avoided. Especially now with banks and countries around the world restricting crypto purchases on a massive scale by way of blockading exchanges or outright banning it. You cannot expect people to spend their crypto in the hopes they can buy it back.

Bitcoin, no matter how good it is at making payments will still continue to be hoarded until fiat is no longer in circulation. Gresham's law in action.

This is where the store of value properties of bitcoin will be derived from.

How would short term gains be taxed in crypto if your income was within the 10% tax bracket $0-$9,325?

If I held crypto long term for over a year and let's say my income that year was $25,000. Could I have a captial gain of $30,000 in crypto and not pay any tax on it?

Let's say my friend bought 1 bitcoin at $6,000 and gives me 1 bitcoin when it is at $8,000 and I sell all of it at $8,000 would I be taxed capital gains?

Noticias de bitcoin,"Creo que este es un movimiento muy bueno para Facebook "", dijo Altucher por correo electrónico, en respuesta a las preguntas de Recode. ""Hay muchas estafas y servicios ilegítimos"".

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  http://www.pittsburghpablog.com/2018/04/future-insurance-currency-bitcion-price.html  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Ese es el mismo sentimiento que Facebook expresó ayer cuando anunció su prohibición de todos los anuncios 

https://www.recode.net/2018/1/31/16954652/james-altucher-facebook-bitcoin-crypto-ban  criptográficos. Y los representantes de Facebook dejaron en claro que la prohibición de anuncios incluía los que Altucher había pagado, en Facebook y en toda la web, con aplicaciones como ""crypto-genius revela el próximo bitcoin"".

Altucher es una industria de autoayuda para un solo hombre que dice que recaudó $ 11 millones en 2016, antes del boom crypto más reciente. Distribuye contenido gratuito en Facebook, podcasts y otros medios, y cobra por suscripciones a servicios que ofrecen selecciones de acciones y otros consejos financieros.

Altucher actualmente está vendiendo un paquete de ""Crypto Trader"" que incluye una ""clase magistral de cifrado de seis videos"" y otros servicios por $ 2,000.

Le pregunté a Altucher cuánto gastó en mercadear sus servicios de criptografía y qué porcentaje de su gasto de mercadotecnia fue para Facebook y cuáles son sus planes ahora. Él no contestó esas preguntas, pero alabó a Facebook por ""tratar de limpiar toda la basura que hay"".

Aquí está el texto de dos correos electrónicos enviados por Altucher en respuesta a mis consultas:

    Creo que este es un movimiento muy bueno para Facebook. Hay muchas estafas y servicios ilegítimos.

    Hace aproximadamente un año tuve la oportunidad de hacer un fondo de cobertura de $ 100mm + en el espacio de cifrado. Lo rechacé para crear un servicio de investigación sólido en el espacio de criptomonedas. Contraté personas, escribí un libro, creé una clase y envié informes cada semana a los suscriptores. Además de mi boletín informativo normal sobre espíritu empresarial, salud / bienestar, y hay algunos artículos cada mes o semana sobre acciones.

    Quería una oportunidad para ayudar a muchas personas en lugar de a unas pocas (he estado allí, he hecho eso en el espacio de fondos de cobertura). Así que agradezco cualquier oportunidad de ayudar a las voces legítimas y sinceras a subir a la cima, como siempre lo hacen.

    Mi esperanza es que se centre mucho más en el espacio cypto en los servicios educativos. Algo así como el 70% de Bitcoins son propiedad de hombres menores de 35 años. Ya es hora de que los anuncios y servicios comiencen a centrarse en la enorme cantidad de personas que simplemente necesitan aprender qué es un Bitcoin IS.

    Y nuevamente, felicitaciones a Facebook por tratar de limpiar toda la basura que hay. Esta es una gran oportunidad pero, como cualquier oportunidad financiera nueva, los intrigantes y los charlatanes corruptos están teniendo un día de campo.

    He trabajado antes con Rob Leathern (el gerente de productos de Facebook que escribió el comunicado de prensa) (yo estaba en la junta directiva de su última compañía, Optimal, que se vendió a Brand Networks por $ 35 millones). Él es un chico de nivel genio en este espacio y sabe lo que está haciendo. En general, este es un movimiento positivo para el espacio de criptomonedas.",1523429301,11/04/2018 06:48:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bf2zk/noticias_de_bitcoin/,0

Bitcoin transaction signature,"Hi guys
I have a question regarding the bitcoin transaction signature
In the TX output locking script we don't deal with the Receiver Public key use actually only the Receiver  Bitcoin address (&lt;pubKeyHash&gt; in the script below - as I understand):

**OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG**

And when the Receiver tries to use the output he must provide the unlocking script:
**&lt;sig&gt; &lt;pub key&gt;**
where &lt;sig&gt; - is a newly created TX signature with the Receiver Private key and &lt;pub key&gt; - is the Receiver public key (derived from the Private key)

But imagine that some bad guy wants to use my UTXO.
This bad guy has
1. His Private Key,
2. His Public key (Derived from the Private key)
3. He knows my Bitcoin address (this is quite public info)

Now the bad guy creates a transaction, signs it with his Private Key and generates an Unlocking script &lt;bad guy TX sig&gt; &lt;Bad guy Public Key&gt;
On the stage of verification we connect the unlocking and unlocking scrips:
 **&lt;bad guy TX sig&gt; &lt;Bad guy Public Key&gt;     OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG**

Of course the script fails on the stage of OP_EQUALVERIFY  because the  Bitcoin address generated from the swindler Public Key is not equal to the &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; of the Receiver (specified in the locking sctipt)
But ... let's imagine(just hypothetically) that this verification passed
and we went to the next step - Transaction verification with OP_CHECKSIG.  **And my main confusion is that I realize that OP_CHECKSIG verification will always pass because what was signed with the bad  Private key will be always verified correctly with his Public key because regardless of the bad guy intentions - his Public - Private key pair is a valid pair.**
So as I see OP_CHECKSIG does not make any sense (it always true) at all and only a Bitcoin address verification assures that the Receivers address derives from his Public key - but it looks too weak
Please explain/correct me where I'm wrong.
Thanks a lot.",1523430151,11/04/2018 07:02:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bf57d/bitcoin_transaction_signature/,0
India prohibits the trade of virtual currency than special currency,"At present, there are about 5 million virtual currency holders in India.

A drop of dozens of percentage points. AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions

People who are not familiar with the risks of virtual currency must never touch it.

3 basic facts that show Bitcoin is the most secure and trustable financial system that the world has ever known.,"No other financial system in the world can boast any single one of these facts, much less all 3 of them.

* Every single transaction is 100% guaranteed to be completed exactly as it is specified. Every transaction. Exactly as specified. Zero exceptions.

* No other person, government, or entity can access your funds. Access is available only to an individual who has the exact and unhackable cryptographic key. 

* The system is available 24/7/365 via thousands of global, decentralized, independent, redundant computer systems. Downtime is impossible.

The vast majority of people are just starting to come to this overall realization. Will be a fun ride as this concept becomes widespread, common, and accepted.

Another Shower thought,"Tesla are creating solar roof tiles to link up with their powerwall battery pack to help take residential homes off the grid and create sustainable clean energy.

How absolutely epic would it be if within that bundle they added a bitcoin miner that automatically uses excess energy as a way for the home owner to get paid.

Probably not gonna happen anytime soon, but this would be a great way to help secure the network with distributed clean energy while helping adoption. I mean who wouldnt want their roof to pay them an income.

Bitcoin will not return to the peak age?,"Market players and participants are still discussing the final value of bitcoin. Has the bubble of bitcoin started to break? Barclays's strategists speculated that the market driven demand pushed the bitcoin value up to a great degree because of the worry of missing the opportunity. 
AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions. More and more people have seen the existence of digital assets, making these digital assets the focus of attention, which also makes some market participants think it will bring pressure to future earnings.

""Combined with our theoretical modeling results, the results show that the latest peak may be the highest, and speculative interest may be reduced here,"" Barclays strategist wrote in a study on Tuesday. AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions. The reduction of such speculative interest has led to a oversupply of the owner of bitcoin, which now determines the price trend rather than the pure supply and demand factor, the strategist said.

Until 2015, demand pushed up prices, followed by supply sell-off. However, since 2015, these variables have emerged one after another, which indicates that speculation is from supply side. AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions

The decrease of speculative buying is also the result of popularity of virtual assets.

This is the home stretch. it will be the hardest time to maintain your belief in bitcoin because the attacks against bitcoin will become worse, but it will also be the most rewarding. 

I have a strong feeling the next halving that will take place in 2020 will be the day we ""win"". It will be the worlds last chance to buy-in before stability is formed and solidified. The next 2 years ahead of us will be challenging but if you have the perseverance it will be beyond rewarding.

Is it possible for a failed transaction to be recovered?,"Sorry, back to the Dream Market issue again. But I just remembered that someone asked for advice a while ago because they had not paid a high enough fee for their bitcoin transaction to be successful, and they were told that eventually the coins would end up back in the original wallet.

Is this true? Could this be the case with the BCH deposits that are failing to show up in Dream Market wallets? All these deposits are just building up more and more confirmations. They can't arrive at the destination wallet. Do they just float around in the blockchain forever or does the transaction eventually get cancelled and the coins appear back in the original wallet?

I don't know much about how the blockchain works as you can probably tell. But I'm desperate for some hope!",1523522222,12/04/2018 08:37:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bonlm/is_it_possible_for_a_failed_transaction_to_be/,1

MARKET STUDY
Online gambling industry has been plagued by inability to tackle high tech cheating and lack of transparency. To name a few, 2008 and 2011 online poker scandals led to online gambling bans in some countries. Though it was off to a shaky start, online gambling is well set to become the gambling industry's fastest-growing sector, and accounts for 11% of the $385B of gambling profits posted in 2016. These numbers are only set to grow as regulations worldwide are loosening their stance toward online betting. The profitability of the online gambling market has been showing a steady growth. H2 Gambling Capital specialists forecast that this market will grow up to USD 47.4 billion in 2017 and will exceed USD 60 billion by 2020, which means a 10% annual growth. The Tavaron Company already has such products as Bingo, Poker and Casino in its product portfolio. The share of such products in the global gaming industry will amount to 38% (USD 22.8 billion) by 2020. Cryptocurrencies are coming through as the new giant in the online gambling market, turning into the most common method of payment on gambling sites. Until recently, cryptocurrencies were not so widely accepted by major gambling sites, but slowly they are marching forward as one of the major accepted means. Most participants and market experts believe that the online gambling market backed by cryptocurrencies will continue to grow in popularity. Such rapid After various studies, researches and analytics, there is one thing that everyone has given their nod to is that the market of online betting will continue to grow steeply in the coming years. There are various reasons that speak for this expected growth. Number of people who have joined the internet in the past few years have grown exponentially and out of those, a fair amount have shown interest in online betting. Be it casino games or sports betting, this industry has managed to attract a lot of people. This trend is expected to remain such in the future. Another very interesting facet that must be looked at is, Many countries of di¬erent demographic philosophies have sought ways to create laws in the favor of this industry. This would gradually appeal to those who previously wanted to try a hand or two but resisted themselves due to some fear. The environment is suitable, the time is correct and most importantly, people are looking at this industry with expectations, and we have decided to turn their expectations into reality. We are here to solve the existing problems, bring innovations and deliver an entertaining and exciting betting system to the people.

How I managed to make a ton of money in crypto and lose almost all of it in 2 short months,"I was up 280% (!!!) on my whole portfolio and then this happened…

It all started in September when I decided to enter the crypto market, I was so passionate about it.. I spent hours reading about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies and how it’s going to change the world, reading about all the influential people and big stock market money flowing in to the market.. 
I’ve been following the cryptocurrency market since July market cap was at 80-100 Billion, I watched carefully as I saw the market cap grow to 140 Billion in September and decided to jump in. I convinced my brother to put in 10k and I put in 20k and off we went.

The dream comes true...
Have you ever felt you are at the right time at the right place?!?! Because this feeling never happened to me before… 
Wow October we were up 50% November an extra 70% by Mid-December I was up 300% on my whole portfolio!!!! Hollyshit… I remember being in a coin called ADA while it flew 400% in 2 days!!!
Honestly I was already dreaming about buying an apartment, putting aside money for my future kids and helping out my parents with their mortgage payments.

The higher you go up the harder you fall..
By the end of December my portfolio was up by 350%..
At this point I was talking to my self mainly “can this be?” should I take out some of the funds I put in? shold I take out my initial investment?
Sure it’s easy to look back and make decisions… but at the time 1 trillion dollar market cap didn’t look like a problem.. I spoke to my Brother and even though we talked about liquidating some of our investments we never did…
January came by and all the hope and dreams came down crashing.. it started with a small downtrend and became one of the worst bear markets the crypto market has even seen… people are running around screaming in the streets.. blood all over.. JK that was in my head but I sure did see a change in sentiment, suddenly positive news became negative and everywhere I could just see noobies like my self panicking.



Conclusions and why I am optimistic about the future 
Yes it sucks, yes I was up 350% and now I am down almost 50% on my entire portfolio, but honestly what was I thinking? This isn’t a get rich scheme.. this is the future of technology and exchange of value as we know it… the biggest companies and countries in the world are just at the beginning of adopting Blockchain and using cryptocurrencies. 
1 thing is for sure, I’ve learned my lesson. When you’re up by a substantial amount of % on your portfolio you always ALWAYS take out at least your initial investment or a third of what you invest. This experience made me a better investor and better trader.

My recent findings
Since February when my portfolio was bleeding to death, I was looking for some sort of Mentor I can follow, someone real that gives real advice.. bot these fake twitter influencers or telegram signal accounts but someone I can ask questions and get real answers from a real trader or investor with experience.
So first off I like watching Tone vays, a real trader and expert analysis that keeps the bull shit out and gives you real technical analysis.
and then I stumbled upon this 60+ yo with 30 years of trading experience and a young 32 yo doctor who post a lot on Reddit, at first I was skeptical but as I followed I started to feel these people were honest people that want to help other new traders like my self… I contacted them and wow… amazing human beings.. Remi (the doctor) spent an hour and a half on giving me fundamental tools to look at and went over my portfolio to help me recover, while I am currently learning TA from Mack a true expert in TA.
This is not a promotion for them nor am I affiliated with them just thought I would share what I found and let other traders like me know, there are good people out there that want to help…",1523532859,12/04/2018 11:34:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bpg6w/how_i_managed_to_make_a_ton_of_money_in_crypto/,18

The real power of Bitcoin - Proof of HUMAN work,"""*It's all open source so where's the advantage for Bticoin? Anyone can take it and use it on their coin?!?!*""

If you find yourself caught up in FUD or panicing because this or that technology can work on every coin keep this in mind. 

The pyramids in Egypt have been standing for thousands of years, studied and explored since they were built. At this point you can say the pyramids design is ""open source"". So why does no one build new pyramids, then???

#Proof-of-work. Proof of HUMAN work.

It would take A LOT of HUMAN work to build pyramids of the same size and impact, and that's not easy. Can it be done, in principle? Sure. Can it be done in practice? Most likely not.

&amp;nbsp;

Yes, the LN can be ported to any coin. It's open source, after all. But all that requires HUMAN DEV WORK! And if you didn't fix malleability, you'll need to do that FIRST. Can you port SegWit to other coins? Sure, it's there for everyone to grab. But it needs *countless* hours to do. And the same logic applies to every other innovation that was/will be released on Bitcoin. Can it be ported to other coins? Yes, but not for free - It will need time and effort.

What you need is a huge community of devs, volunteering free time to improve your coin. Or those ""free, open source"" enhancements ain't gonna happen on your favourite coin.

And whilst others will be busy porting Bitcoin's tech to other coins what will Bitcoin do? Push development even further, making harder and harder for anyone to catch up. 

And yes, even if you contribute a Bitcoin icon for MacOS you are contributing to the ecosystem. Other coins don't have it. Thank you. 


&amp;nbsp;

Bitcoin is not the MySpace of cryptos. Bitcoin is the MySpace + Facebook + Reddit + Twitter + Insta + 4chan + WhateverIsYetToCome. Because it has the largest community of devs doing real human work every day. Not easy to replace.

How the price manipulation works,"I recently caught up with a friend who is deeply into whale circles and he told me all this crap, he is reliable but I do admit it sounds far-fetched.                  





                                




So apparently there are two collectives of investors trying to manipulate the prices. On one hand, a group of Asian investors nicknamed the ""Beijing Boys"" and another group of investors consisting of British and Wall Street traders, without a fancy nickname.








The Asian boys are pumping up bitcoin by buying it off exchanges selling it offline and using the money to buy it off the exchanges again. They were very successful in 2017, but are now suffering because of capital restrictions and local regulations.                                               







The other group consists of Wall Street traders using a similar tactic, but reversed, they established net shorting positions around November, then got hammered in December and now they're up again. They regularly close shorts to buy bitcoin offline, to dump it online.








The Bejing Boys were able to keep up the price for a very long time until they were hit by Asian governments, they closed their long positions and their holdings were frozen.     







Some of these funds were unfrozen last week and the investigations (money laundering) will likely be resolved out of court.                                   







No one knows if the Beijing Boys will get back to trading, or if the stipulations of potential agreements will permit them to do so, but some sharks have decided to dump their shorts.                          







The assumption is that they won't be able to trade crypto again, which could crash the cryptos back to 4-6k. There are other Beijing Boys coming up, a few smaller groups have attempted similar tactics in South America and the Eastern European/ Russian region.                         








However, no one is able to match the degree of coordination the Bejing Boys were capable of. They were well-funded and very well organized. Other groups generally lack trust, some members selling before reaching a goal, forcing collective panic sells, or they lack the funds to effectively and consistently keep the price under control.",1523554553,12/04/2018 17:35:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bs1cj/how_the_price_manipulation_works/,0

But here is the thing. A few years later, on his way to Merica,  he sent two wireless messages  and received one on the ship, he wrote: 

&gt;The wireless telegraphy is one of the most wonderful inventions the world has ever seen. I think it will be of great commercial use some day and as I have seen it demonstrated on the ship in which I have just arrived I can say that it is very marvelous indeed.

Now that's being intellectually honest. Thats the difference between people like Kelvin, and people like Schiff, and a few other things. lol

"Transaction capacity per block now, with Segwit/Batching vs last year without either.","I'm trying to see if visually there are more transactions possible per block with these two scaling initiatives. 

If you check the mempool carefully you can see at what number of transactions it takes before 1sat/byte fees are no longer confirmed in each time period. This is obviously the point where fees increase because of full blocks.

Looking at the start of 2017 (earliest I could check on Johoe's site) vs now how much difference would you estimate there is?

From what I can tell we fit about 2300 transactions per block generally right now. Obviously this can vary slightly depending on the size of the transactions.

I think at the start of the year it seems roughly 800 transactions could fit per block generally as a rough comparison.

Does anyone have any comments on this? Or are we able to say that right now we are genuinely fitting roughly 2.8 times more transactions per block?

This would indicate that if the market was stalled by the fees in the last run that theoretically we could reach over 40,000USD before getting similar complaints in the next run? This also assuming that Lightning does not take on a small role and remove at least a small percentage somewhere along the line.

of course I wait 12hrs editing my interview of the doc who said publish before 6am,"###Popular NYC physician reveals the presence of possible “Crypto Cartel”.  
##Alerts a significant rally in pricing may be imminent…


In an early morning press conference, Dr. Remi Soltys, a well-known NYC physician and the founder of a popular online cryptocurrency trading community, confirmed that the rumors of a cartel like influence in the sector appear to be accurate. 


Dr. Soltys noted that a careful analysis of BitCoin short sales in the months since its $20,000 high last December, reveals the footprint of what appears to be a single, very large actor working to suppress BTC pricing. Some in the sector have come to call this mysterious group the “Crypto Cartel”. 


While the wider BitCoin community has been unable to resist the multi-billion dollar pressure exerted by the “Cartel"", new institutional scale investors in the sector seem to be coming to the rescue. 


In what Dr. Soltys has described as a ""Battle for the heart of cryptocurrency"", a rapidly increasing number of large investors with billion dollar capital reach have contributed a much needed boost in Long Orders for BTC. This, counterbalancing the effects of the Cartel’s carefully orchestrated efforts at moving BTC’s price lower. 


As this new threat to their plans became evident on Tuesday of this week, the Cartel began fighting back with a campaign of short orders so massive, the trading day’s Short Order total exceeded Long Orders for the first time since October of last year. The effect of this large scale increase in short selling would normally have been continued downward motion of price. Instead, as of the time of this release, BTC's price continues to rise. A very large scale sea change in this important sector may be imminent, says Dr. Soltys. 


Analysts working with Dr. Soltys and his team predict that **when the effect of the current short trading Cartel is nullified, a sudden, and significant increase in the price of this currency will result**. Current developments in the BTC chart signal that this multi-billion dollar reversal may already be underway. 


Dr. Soltys is a resident of NYC and is readily available for discussions and interviews. Dr. Soltys set aside his career as a popular NYC Internal Medicine physician to pursue a passionate involvement in cryptocurrency, and supporting block chain technologies. 

For more information Dr. Soltys has provided an email address for contact, DrRemiSoltys(at)Gmail.",1523560157,12/04/2018 19:09:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bsrgk/of_course_i_wait_12hrs_editing_my_interview_of/,7

Has Anyone Ever Gotten Taxed From Using a Bitcoin VCC or Debit Card?,"Hello all,

I have a bit of Bitcoin in a separate online wallet, and I was considering using with one of the Bitcoin Debit Cards or VCC services, such as maybe BitPay. However, if the service verifies your identity, and you use a hefty amount through the service, would I be taxed for it next tax season? I'm asking so I can consider putting the amount aside ahead of time in case they do.

This is probably a question geared more toward people who have used the services for more than a year, and have ran a few thousand dollars worth of BTC through it, rather than someone who just bought a few dollars worth of toothpaste for the lols.",1523560621,12/04/2018 19:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bstk3/has_anyone_ever_gotten_taxed_from_using_a_bitcoin/,0

"Bitcoin, negative proofs of moneyness, value progress","Hi all. Longtime /r/bitcoiner.

A lot of the qualities of bitcoin that prove it is money are unfortunately negative. For example, people steal it. People don't risk criminal prosecution to steal things that aren't valuable. People also use bitcoin to buy illegal drugs. I don't think that one is bad, only a political media football..but again, what do you buy drugs with? Money. No one risks selling illegal products for worthless garbage.

The bitcoin debate and the associated different atmosphere of all bitcoin forums has been a difficult transition for all bitcoiners. I used to take a break from the rising tensions in 2015-16 by visiting /r/monero, which at the time was a lot like /r/bitcoin in early 2013 (no controversial debates, friendly techies responding immediately to arcane node questions, etc).

With monero's hard fork, their subreddit is now becoming a lot like the various bitcoin subreddits in 2015-2016 (for example, more political posts espousing support for individuals regarded as leaders over broader tech, political posts attacking chinese miners). Stakes are rising. People compete. It gets emotional and political. 

I'm not saying this is a bad thing, even though it's lamentable and uncomfortable. This is just another negative proof of money. People don't get emotional, defensive, and offensive about things that are worthless.

Whatever your thoughts on moderation etc, know that many of the criticisms lobbed at bitcoin would not exist if bitcoin was not valuable. The more value it gets, the higher the perceived ROI of such criticisms. 

We're seeing this now in other communities, but bitcoin, as ever, has the most empirical history in moving through the headwinds.",1523564763,12/04/2018 20:26:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8btczz/bitcoin_negative_proofs_of_moneyness_value/,0

In response to the meme about not HODLing,"The biggest reason why crypto isn’t moving is because it is too difficult to buy. Yes, the value goes up when it is exchanged as a currency, but businesses need to accept crypto for that to work.... And for that to work it needs to be more easily exchangeable for fiat. There’s nothing wrong with saving your money, if fiat and bitcoin were on the same level it wouldn’t matter how much you HODL because if you bought something with bitcoin you could just transfer some fiat and you wouldn’t lose anything. 

Until bitcoin is more accepted as a payment option for products and services, it isn’t a currency.",1523567033,12/04/2018 21:03:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8btnk1/in_response_to_the_meme_about_not_hodling/,0
Bitcoin with friends,"Hi, /r/bitcoin

I have a question:

What's the easiest, most user friendly way to transfer bitcoin between friends using our phones? 

Imagine my friend pays for a 20$ pizza we are going to share and I want to pay him half of it. How would you do that? 

I want an app where you add friends, and addresses to them, and you can just send anyone X amount of bitcoins. It'd be even better if you could  send the equivalent to an amount of USD/EUR.

It's hard to find anything in a market with so many (shitty) apps. I feel thus is a use case that bitcoin should be perfect for, right?

Technically Dubai does not tax capital gain but I read that it classifies Bitcoin as a commodity so I might have to pay VAT on them.

The only other way I could think of is for global governments to coordinate and agree to shut down all crypto exchanges so no new fiat can be converted to BTC, and ban anyone from accepting BTC as a method of payment. This wouldn't drive the value to zero but it would severely reduce it.

Why do Saudi Arabian regulators still disregard Bitcoins?,"Since the foundation of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom in 1932 Riyal has remained under a direct and stringent control of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), which acts as the country's central bank. That fact alone may explain an extraordinary stability of the SAR's exchange rate, which, during the past three decades, has sensibly deviated from its sacramental value of 3.75 SAR to 1 USD only once. That had happened during 2008 financial crisis, when SAR/USD ratio temporarily hit 3.71 mark.

Naturally, then, that with such phenomenal, almost divine authoritative power concentrated in its hands, SAMA couldn't care less about potential competition from part of crypto. It was again re-confirmed in a period of September - October 2017, when several high positioned government officials expressed their disdain for Bitcoin, stating that, despite recent upsurge in crypto prices, they do not believe in its future. Additionally, they asserted that such an incoherent apparition as the decentralized digital currency, which is not backed by any government, doesn't deserve an attention of important people and must stay outside of the Kingdom's legal realm.

Looks like, however, that such a scornful disregard of Saudi regulators may only enchant local crypto-community, which has been effectively left alone and might now accumulate digital treasures without being immediately harassed by tax and security market watchdogs. Some, nevertheless, may argue that an absence of comprehensive regulations is a serious impediment to the adaption of crypto by local banks, exchanges and retail businesses. Still, it's hard to see how in a country, where almost all state institutions, including religious establishment (as had been expressed by a popular cleric during one of the local TV show in December 2017), do have some serious misgivings about the new form of cryptographically reinforced electronic money, there may be ever adapted any kind of pro-crypto legislations.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: not friendly;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: e-commerce (real-estate), e-services (on-line shopping), e-games;
major limitations: slowing economy (GDP growth rate is below zero), high legal and administrative barriers to SME, shortage of qualified work-force;
stimulus: high-income population (per-capita exceeds $21,000), developed infrastructure (fixed Internet penetration rate at almost 70%), low energy costs;
opportunities: to create a local e-business aiming at young rural users of mobile Internet.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): not regulated (negative).

Tracking trades,"Hi everyone,

With tax around the corner, a lot of traders right now are starting to prepare the necessary trade document(s) for taxation. 

Would anyone here know a really good tool where I could either connect to a tool/service that will then recognise all of my trades and track them afterwards OR where I can just upload a CSV of all of my trades to date and it will put them into one file.

It has to be able to gather information from BTCMarkets, Coinspot and IDEX as well as the major exchanges as well.

block.io help :'(,"First of all, this is my first time doing anything with bitcoin and it's a bad time. I deposited .032 bitcoin into block.io, and I regret it. The site itself is kind of sketchy and inactive, which I should of looked at before actually depositing. I made an account, made a secret key, forgot to save my mnemonic, and deposited the bitcoin. I then tried to withdraw it, and it said the key was wrong. I know it isn't wrong, as I tried literally all combinations of my several passwords. It actually doesn't even say incorrect, it says ""invalid"", but it says incorrect if I put something wrong in there. They say the account isn't recoverable if you forget your secret key but I know I haven't. The twitter hasn't had a message written on it since 2015, and their support hasn't replied since the ticket I put in a couple of days ago. On one of their twitter posts, somebody did post last year that the site was a scam and that their key didn't work and they couldn't withdraw. Fuck, dawg. Any advice?

"Americans, Bitcoin, Income tax (ignorance is not bliss)","http://www.losthorizons.com/BulletinBoard.htm

THERE HAS BEEN A FLURRY OF WORRY and fuss over recent IRS efforts to secure information on bitcoin transactors. The anxiety is misplaced.

Let me say first that there is nothing inherently taxable about using or receiving bitcoin. It's just a medium of exchange like any other. There is no tax on exchanges per se, nor on profits, gains or receipts, per se.

By the same token, however, there is a tax-- measurable by the value of bitcoin received-- for doing taxable things resulting in those receipts. That is, not all things done for which bitcoin might be received are taxable, but the receipt of bitcoin is relevant to the tax when received for doing taxable things.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS that concern about IRS prying into records of bitcoin transactions is misdirected. The concern should be at the prying itself, without regard to the bitcoin element.

Unless it has been previously established that a taxable activity has been conducted, the IRS has no valid interest in any transaction. Thus, a blanket demand for information on all transactions is an offensive, possibly 4th amendment-violating intrusion.

AT THE SAME TIME, anyone and everyone engaging in bitcoin transactions and troubled by these bureaucratic intrusions MUST BECOME CtC-EDUCATED. That and that alone will protect from all the practical ill-effects of such intrusions (which routinely happen in other venues, such as conventional banking, anyway).

Only those ignorant of the hidden truths about the income tax have reason to fear information falling into the hands of the IRS. So, keep on keeping crypto. Just get educated about the tax, too.

PS. The IRS DOES NOT want Americans to #WakeUp, the gravytrain must roll on. The moderators here have censored me and this message in the past, on the IRS' behalf, out of ignorance.
That is this subreddits loss.

"Marketwatch article: ""This is all it would take for bitcoin to become a worthless cryptocurrency"" &amp; My Response (self.Bitcoin)","Hey everyone! You might remember me from some of my other recent cryptocurrency articles, like my responses to certain anti-Bitcoin diatribes posted on Forbes. This time I'm back with something a little different: a response to a common, modern argument against Bitcoin. In this case I've used a recently-published Marketwatch article as a sort of metric, but the guy who wrote this is by no means alone in making this argument. The argument is this: if Bitcoin's price goes down enough, miners will abandon the coin and it will become worthless overnight because no one will be facilitating transactions.

Basically, I got tired of seeing this everywhere, and I thought it would be useful to explore all the technical and social reasons why it's wrong. For what it's worth, I *don't* think the article I'm responding to is clickbait - at least, not egregious clickbait. I just think the guy happens to be wrong.

I'd love to hear what you guys think of my response. Thanks for reading!

Bitcoin Boom: Japan Trades $97 Billion in One Month,,1523603987,13/04/2018 07:19:47,http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-japan-97-billion-one-month/,3
"My take on the whole thing, an analysis over several months","Ever since the downward trend started (around the 18th of Dec) bitcoin never actually went lower than the dip on the 6th of February (6090USD). If you bought on that day right now you're up by about 22%.

6000 USD seems like the point where shorting becomes too hard to maintain and if we look at the latest dip the lowest point was about 6500 USD (1st of April). It seems that shorting becomes more and more difficult to maintain.

The bounceback was less significant for a simple reason: shorters don't want to lose money so they will keep trying.

The resistance point has increased from 6000 to 6500 for a simple reason: Hodlers don't want to lose bitcoin so they're not selling. 

This is one big game of chicken. 

By the way if you want to use it as a currency and not have to deal with any of this volatility just buy as much as you need and then pay for the stuff you want to get.",1523604047,13/04/2018 07:20:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bxcbb/my_take_on_the_whole_thing_an_analysis_over/,0

Best SEPA Bank Account for Non Residents of Europe to Use GDAX,"I live in UAE and its so difficult to buy and sell Bitcoin, i need to do that fast so i have to use GDAX, but unfortunately it doesn't support UAE. 

I have a German bank account as I'm german, but as my luck Gdax unfortunately doesn't support Germany as well :(

Thats why, Is there any other way to use GDAX, maybe by opening an account in another European country ?
Has anybody gone this route and how was their experience like?

Which banks in the SEPA supported region allow EU residents to open an account? Preferably online but don't rule out banks who require a personal visit either; I'm sure the savings would quickly add up considering the costs and delays of wire transfers.

We can set up laws and financial systems and monetary policy and contracts on the blockchain.

Government is nothing but a local warlord that extracts wealth.

"Value of LN and merchant integration vs. a crypto debit card for spending, In addition to personal safety from potential extortion and kidnapping","Hi Reddit,

I’d love to hear your thoughts here.

Obviously LN will have value for the eco system, in addition to other types of merchants/online payment processors adoption BTC and other cryptos.

One thing is a physical shop supporting crypto for payments, but what about the option of just holding a debit card and being able to spend whenever and where ever you please.

A debit card is easier: you don’t need a phone, you don’t need an internet connection, you don’t need to worry about where you can spend your currencies. 

Personally I’ve almost never bought anything for my crypto. I’ve traded a bit, sold some and holding the rest. I’m a BTC bull and believe in it as a store of value and a competitor to gold.

I might decide to spend more in the future, and then I’m thinking that a debit card is the way to go. Easier, less hassle and more anonymous.

In regards of the comment of it being anonymous. Imagine traveling the world on crypto, from an opsec perspective a debit card would be safer. The alternative is constantly letting people know you have crypto, something that could turn to a hostage situation in theory. The average crypto traveler will most likely be carrying a trezor or such to manage funds also.

Yes I know, dramatic - but am I not right? If you travel through South America, do you want everyone to know your a crypto guy or would you rather not? Criminals are not just stupid people and the extortion and kidnapping stories will just continue, as you hopefully have seen there are several examples of this already.",1523623880,13/04/2018 12:51:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bywr5/value_of_ln_and_merchant_integration_vs_a_crypto/,0

"Update: Hi /r/Bitcoin! I quit my job to start Cointaxes. Here to answer questions about taxes and digital currencies! I published a YouTube series on top questions, launched crypto tax tools and would love your input on ANY other topics or questions! :)","Hi /r/Bitcoin! Thank you for reading! 

In the last two months since I posted here, my team and I have been hard at work trying to make everyone's lives a bit easier for cryptocurrency and tax. In fact, we will be able to launch some tools this summer that will help optimize your trades from a tax perspective - as you make them. We think there's a chance we could even make it tax advantageous to use crypto vs. fiat... more on that later. For now, we would love to get your feedback on what we're working on.

&gt; The TLDR: [We made Cointaxes so you can estimate your tax liability and whether or not you have FINCEN obligations for free on our site](https://www.cointaxes.com). It was important to make this summary information free because our mission is create confidence and certainty around cryptocurrencies. 


Please let me know if you have any questions or comments (I'll probably respond to every comment here!)


&gt; [**Watch a Cointaxes' YouTube Series answering the top questions**](https://www.cointaxes.com/guide) How are cryptocurrencies taxed? Why should you pay this year? Am I taxed when I convert into fiat or pull money out of my exchanges? What about mining and airdrops? All this and more is covered!

&gt; **We launched a tool to help measure your FINCEN requirements for FBAR &amp; FATCA**

In my last post, I mentioned a ""fun"" fact around FINCEN requirements. The media is talking about this more [(i.e. CNBC  - ""How cryptocurrency investors could find themselves behind bars"")](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/how-cryptocurrency-investors-could-find-themselves-behind-bars.html). The good news is it's really simple for the ledger technology we built to check if you cross the $10,000 or $50,000 thresholds. On our [site, Cointaxes,](https://www.Cointaxes.com) you can add your exchanges and then check if you have crossed the threshold. Importantly, we wanted to make this critical information available for free. Particularly because the the deadline is April 15. 

If you fail to file the FBAR, the deadline will be extended to October 15. You can read more about this on official government sites [General FBAR information](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar), [FBAR FAQS (not super helpful IMO)](https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/docs/FBAR_EFILING_FAQ.pdf) and the [online form itself](https://bsaefiling1.fincen.treas.gov/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/htmldefault.html).

&gt; **About Cointaxes** 

Cointaxes was formed and funded with the mission to establish confidence and certainty around cryptocurrency. We have a base tax preparation tool with support for Coinbase, GDAX, Binance, Bittrex, Poloniex, and Kraken.  

[We made Cointaxes so you can estimate your tax liability and whether or not you have FINCEN obligations for free on our site](https://www.cointaxes.com). Your detailed reports or Form 8949 for tax filing is behind a modest paywall compared to what we've seen other tools out there charging.

We see global adoption of digital currencies as an inevitability. The uncertainty lies in how effectively and smoothly this once-in-a-lifetime shift occurs. As a tax preparation service, we have a special seat in the cryptocurrency ecosystem directly related to this uncertainty: it is our job to help both citizens and governments around the world understand how to use and treat digital currencies.


* We will regularly invite regulators, lawyers and tax experts to private discussions and public webinars to ensure you will have a firm understanding with each regulatory shift as the world adopts cryptocurrencies.


* We will conduct proprietary research and publish Cointaxes Guides to answer questions you may have about using your digital currency.


* We will provide [high quality cryptocurrency tax preparation software](http://www.cointaxes.com) for individuals and tax professionals.

&gt; **If our mission excites you** 


* Please know that we are hiring. Contact jobs@cointaxes.com with a resume and cover letter.


* If you're are regulator or a crypto-experienced legal or tax professional, please contact experts@cointaxes.com with some background information and reason for connecting.


* Please consider following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cointaxes) and liking our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/cointaxes/)!

Increasing the standard of living of every human being on the planet,"I think that it is time for the global crypto community to form a world wide political movement centered around the adoption of cryptocurrencies. The mission statement should be ""To improve the standard of living of every human being on the planet"" Global crypto adoption will significantly increase the number of mutually beneficial transactions taking place around the world, hence more wealth for everyone to enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

ECON 101: I have an apple that is worth $2 to me. It is worth $4 to you. I sell it to you for $3, we both are now $1 wealthier. This is the basis for how all wealth is created around the world. The world has far greater wealth than it did in 100 years ago in 1918, it didn't land here from outer space, it was created, and governments certainly didn't create it. People trading, producing and consuming created it. Politicians and people constantly bitch about who has a large accumulation of wealth, and they always ignore talking about how wealth is created LOL

&amp;nbsp;





Government controlled fiat significantly damages people's ability to participate in the above stated process (central banks, inflation, foreign currency crap, banking controls. etc)

Feedback needed on crowd-buying with crypto - Peddler,"Starting today, peddler.com is accepting payment with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and 12 other cryptocurrencies.

We are looking for the crypto community feedback, thats how we built Peddler - with help from communities. We are constantly looking to enhance our platform, and openly discuss feature considerations, and we like to answer your questions. With you guys as the core driver of the platform, we want to know what we are missing or can make better.

With products ranging from the hottest new Parrot drones to Samsung phones or Nike sneakers, we want to give the Ethereum community a place to buy real products they actually want. Within the next month Peddler.com will be the first to offer crowd-buys on cars for crypto throughout the EU.

Why Peddler started accepting Crypto:

“We realised we have a lot of customers who hold bitcoin, eth, litecoin, amongst other crypto currencies but have no place to spend them. So we expanded our crowd buying for cryptocurrency users. After-all we are using smart-contract to match AI driven product demand with merchants. We plan on making Peddler.com the major platform where cryptocurrencies can purchase nearly any product you want, and at the lowest price.""

Using the blockchain and collective purchasing power:

We use AI to aggregate product demand in 1000's of forums, and match this demand with merchants who can provide the product in bulk - we are using smart-contracts to facilitate this. As a crypto consumer you will be able to get offer discounts of 20% to 50% off on products you want. You can even add them your self, simply join the Crypto crowd, and post the product you want.

Peddler.com is creating a global decentralized shopping ecosystem:

“AI enables us to cut out the middle men – big advertisers who are getting our data for nothing – and even start paying users for sharing the things that they want. Our thesis is simple: It's your data and you own it, so you should get paid for it and pay with it. Our ambition is to scale and become decentralised in order provide our AI and crowd buying capability to everyone everywhere -- even cutting out Peddler.com itself.”

Why use Crypto on Peddler?

“Using crypto will allow you to bypass the transaction fees imposed on credit card transactions, and we’ll lock in the fiat value of the product for a period of 15 min (we are working hard to increase to 30 min++) to mitigate the price fluctuations which can occur due to volatile crypto economy” This enables all of our merchant to accept crypto currencies, this is particularly relevant as most merchants still use a legacy supply chain within a cash economy.

Again, any feedback on the platform and your experience buying with cryptos to improve the site is very welcomed, thank you!!",1523630007,13/04/2018 14:33:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bzltr/feedback_needed_on_crowdbuying_with_crypto_peddler/,1

lightning network payment system service for ecommerce,"Hi there,

I currently have a ecommerce site that I have been planning to implement bitcoin payment system. Due to the fact that the value of most purchases are low, using bitcoin was not feasible due to the higher transaction fees. However, now that lightning network is active it is possible to use it in my site. Having frequent customers that are buying low value items seems to be the exact reason for having the lightning network.

I would like to ask how to make this possible. Is there somewhere that I can get a service for setting up the lightning payment system? Or is it possible for an hobbyist programmer like me to set it up with a guide? I would appreciate it if you can direct me to the proper path.",1523637018,13/04/2018 16:30:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c0ia6/lightning_network_payment_system_service_for/,1

"Marketwatch article: ""This is all it would take for bitcoin to become a worthless cryptocurrency"" &amp; My Response","Hey everyone! You might remember me from some of my other recent cryptocurrency articles, like my responses to certain anti-Bitcoin diatribes posted on Forbes. This time I'm back with something a little different: a response to a common, modern argument against Bitcoin. In this case I've used a recently-published Marketwatch article as a sort of metric, but the guy who wrote this is by no means alone in making this argument. The argument is this: if Bitcoin's price goes down enough, miners will abandon the coin and it will become worthless overnight because no one will be facilitating transactions.

Basically, I got tired of seeing this everywhere, and I thought it would be useful to explore all the technical and social reasons why it's wrong. For what it's worth, I *don't* think the article I'm responding to is clickbait - at least, not egregious clickbait. I just think the guy happens to be wrong.

I'd love to hear what you guys think of my response. Thanks for reading!

We are the new world order,"We have a lot of new members in this sub that track Price too often. 

Yesterday an over-shorted Bitcoin caused a Domino effect and $150m of Bitcoin was bought. 

This pumped it by $1000. Immediately the believers came out. We had Draper calling $250k and Pantera calling the bottom. This changed the sentiments dramatically and we supported the new price. Now the alt-run is in place. 

But let's not fall into the same trap. It is 2015 all again. Let's be smart. Build cool Tech. Change the world. 

Don't speculate. You have now all been thru a Satoshi cycle. You are wise in your experience. Teach other people not about your gains and eventual riches, but what it means to displace trust and be decentralised. Be true to the future of a technology that breaks down vertical organisations, dissolves borders and empowers individual. 

Go out and create value. You are the lucky 1%. Change the world for good. Drive value where it is needed. Be bold and courageous. There will be more of this; and there will be a fight.

Who would win: The collective governments of the world or Bitcoin?,"**Who would win: The collective governments of the world or Bitcoin?**

People perceive government as an extremely powerful and effective entity, and this is largely true in many aspects.  Government is able to bring tremendous force against many entities to either compel them into submission or even destroy them completely. 

But in order to accurately understand the situation, you need to look deeper.  Governments are very good at bringing compelling or destructive force against centralized entities.  Corporations, organizations, specific individuals, and other governments are all entities that have reason to fear governments based on past evidence.

But what are some areas government is not so good at, or even areas they are exceptionally weak in?

Governments seem to have a rather big problem attacking things that do not have a centralized point to target.  The illegal drug market is one such example, certain terrorists organizations are another.  Perhaps even the Vietnam War is a display of the difficulties a powerful government has with attacking a distributed or non-centralized entity.

Governments also seem to have great difficulty knowing how to responding to disruptive change preemptively or even in a timely manner **with the appropriate counter response**.  Instead governments seem to respond after a threat becomes clear and does so with a response that is inadequate or even does more damage to itself than doing nothing at all.  The government response to 9/11 is a good example of this, with the creation of the TSA which costs that same government over $7 billion/yr. 

Also, government just seems to operate in a horribly inefficient manner generally.  An entity that creates [sinkholes of bureaucracy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/03/22/sinkhole-of-bureaucracy/) is especially ill equipped to conserve, adjust, and survive when resources are constrained or more generally to execute an effective counter strategy efficiently.

We also know that government gets a great deal of its funding through [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage), which would quickly be cut off as a revenue source if the dollar were to lose value.  If this were to occur, it would put the government in a situation where it's resources are cut off at the very moment they need additional resources to counter attack the monetary threat.

These are all ominous factors for the governments of the world when this inevitable confrontation with Bitcoin finally occurs, but I think there is another perhaps even greater factor that will tilt the scales to the point we can know the outcome of this conflict before it occurs. 

When Ross Ulbricht was arrested in a public library it seemed like a great victory for government and a display of their ability to strike decentralized targets (although this was only possible because of Ross' poor OpSec).  But in the wake of this arrest, I think we see some very worrying signs for the fate of government.  THREE of the agents (Carl Mark Force IV, Shaun Bridges, and a DEA Agent) that were a part of this investigation were charged with criminal activity relating to their efforts to enrich themselves with some of the seized bitcoins.  These agencies are not the local corrupt police force, but rather the FBI, Secret Service, and DEA--why would THREE professional and highly-trained agents switch sides and effectively go from acting on behave their government overloards to rabidly and greedily acting in their own individual interest.  I would suggest this is because of Bitcoin.  When you have a drug bust, generally speaking, most (maybe) of the cash and drugs makes it way through the evidence chain without individual actors siphoning off too much, but with Bitcoin there is no need to launder the cash or sell the drugs, it is just super easy to conceal with much lower risk for the agents getting caught (though not quite low enough for Carl Mark Force IV, it would seem).  In any case, Bitcoin seems to have a mysterious power to pull government actors away by tempting them to act in their own self interest.  In short, [Bitcoin lures government agents into defecting and switching sides to Bitcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoins-shroud-of-subtlety-and-allure/)

**So what do we expect will happen?**

As Bitcoin grows in size governments will eventually move to attack or kill it.  They will take this action too late (it's already too late), their action will be ineffective, and their response will eat up their dwindling resources in a time when their revenue stream is being squeezed by the bitcoin-induced fiat devaluation.  Among those government uses to lead and implement its response, many of those actors will defect and switch sides to Bitcoin perhaps like how King Louis the XVII kept sending waves of soldiers to arrest Napoleon who had escaped Elba until Napoleon sent him word ""please send no more troops, I have enough"".

I see Bitcoin vs Governements of the world as a quintessential David vs Goliath event.  But like David vs Goliath, if you had looked past the surface and understood the situation correctly, you would have known [Goliath was dead the moment David stepped onto the battlefield.](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=243294593)",1523651951,13/04/2018 20:39:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c2fdf/who_would_win_the_collective_governments_of_the/,2

Does Coinbase ever release bitcoins earlier than expected?,I purchased about $1k worth of btc via my checking account. I expected it would take 3-5 days but now its saying my bitcoin will arrive in 7 days. They already debited the money from my bank (on day 2). Is there any chance my btc will arrive earlier than another 5 days? Ive had my account (and verified) for 2-3 years now and have purchased a total of around $4k-5k but always with my debit or credit card.

3 Reasons why Bitcoin is Going Up!,,1523654496,13/04/2018 21:21:36,https://worldofchd.com/2018/04/3-reasons-why-bitcoin-is-going-up/,1
Lightning network is not enough,"Even though the lightning network seems super cool solution to scaling, opening and closing payment channels take up space too. Currently with 1mb blocks the main net can handle maybe 7 transactions per second. If we assume a average person does 3 transactions per day, the main net can support about 200k users.

This is speculative at best but with the lightning network bitcoin can support about 50 million users if we assume that average user opens and closes a payment channel two times a year (220 million transactions per year / 4). This feels optimistic too.. So a block size of maybe 200mb + lightning would support 10 billion, which is ridiculous and from what I understand, increasing it compromises the original idea of decentralisation..

So bitcoin is only at beginning of it's journey and these problems don't exist in near future but are there any projects working on further scaling solutions or any ideas about this? Did I do the math right?

Which is the best country to open a crypto trading exchange?,"Among such countries as USA, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia and Malta I would also mention Finland. 

""Suomen Pankki"" (SP) (Finland's Central Bank) may be considered a hero role model for other EU financial watchdogs to follow. Not only its officials have been closely monitoring crypto-currencies market for years, gradually deepening their understanding of decentralized digital money environment, but also bank's official statements are remarkably different in its measured and thoughtful tonality from wild, almost maniacal crypto-hunt reports issued by some EU financial institutions.

For example, in January 2014, in the wake of anti-crypto-mania SP published on its web-page the following testimony, which was surreptitiously named ""Bitcoin involves risks"". Sure, as any other government backed, coercive, centralized financial gatekeeper, which job is to preserve the stability of the current fractional reserve monetary system, SP is far from being ""pro-Bitcoin"" in it.

Still, when SP's communique says, for instance - ""Use of Bitcoin does, however, involve risks for the user, and its value vis-a-vis official currencies has fluctuated significantly."" and ""The value of a virtual currency is based on supply and demand only. Authorities or other public bodies are not responsible for the purchasing power or stability of Bitcoin, and it can lose its value."" that sound like reasonable, although, negative statements, which, however, do not try to invoke readers' fear or to speculate on public ignorance.

There's no surprise, then, that Finland today possesses one of the most crypto-friendly legal environment on the planet. Even though Finnish tax authorities fully tax all profits derived from crypto-transactions, virtual currencies are exempt from VAT. Additionally, you are not require to obtain a special banking license or to follow KYC rules in order to run a local crypto-broker. As usual, government's friendly approach to crypto-businesses is gratified by the surge of entrepreneurial activity in the country. For example, Finland, among other big technological companies, already harbors World's biggest P2P Bitcoin exchange.

Bitstamp vs Kraken?,"Hey, so both subs for these exchanges are kinda dead.

Have a little TL;DR for why I am looking at changing from Bitstamp.

I've been trading on bitstamp for literally ever.  It hasn't been bad but it hasn't been amazing, and now I'm looking for margin trading.  Kraken has margin trading, however a few months ago (even pre jan fomo) I was hearing tons of complaints about orders not going through and that would be a nightmare.

I have my personal pros and cons list for each, if someone that's been on both for awhile and had experience with larger orders (not huge but not little) add some input?

#Bitstamp

**Pros:**

1. Has been reliable for me

2. Fees are alright.

**Cons:**

1. Fees are a bit higher than kraken.

#Kraken

**Pros:**

1. Margin Trading

2. Lower Fees

3. Way more options

**Cons:**

1. Less volume/liquidity compared to bitstamp in some markets.

2. Have heard complaints in the past.


That's basically my understanding at this point.  I've been on Kraken for a month or two but never made trades over $100.  Was wondering if I could get any input from more experienced traders, thanks!",1523666787,14/04/2018 00:46:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c426b/bitstamp_vs_kraken/,1

I have an idea about starting some crypto-business and would like to hear your opinion on this.,"So it's very simple. I live in Toronto, Canada and I have a budget of $200k+ (USD). My idea is to build a large warehouse specifically for mining operations. I want to build it, provide enough electricity and rent it out to other mining businesses. The warehouse will be located in some deep-ass corner of Ontario to lower electricity bills and having a colder air in winter. 

The idea seemed good to me because in the worst case scenario I can reorganize it and rent out for some other type of business or possibly as a server room of some company. 

So If you have any comments I would like to hear it.",1523678822,14/04/2018 04:07:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c57f6/i_have_an_idea_about_starting_some_cryptobusiness/,1
"Tax day 17 years ago, and now","Exactly 17 years ago,  Friday the 13th 2001,  I remember sitting around discussing with friends that day's trading on Internet stocks on NASDAQ.  I had stopped day trading months prior but still followed stocks on the message boards.  I had actually visualized paper trades in my mind to perfectly take advantage of an anticipated wild move.  Just like now,  the Internet bubble had recently burst close to the end of the year,  and there were some owing taxes they couldn't pay.

Back in 2001 the message board buzz was that since taxes were due Monday the 16th, Friday the 13th was the day everyone would sell (at a loss) to make sure their tax checks would clear.   My mental paper trades were all shorts placed in early April.  My trades fluctuated wildly right up until the 11th , then .......

NOTHING,  nada,  zip , zero action.  My paper trades were essentially flat.

One of those friends that night was caught in a tax trap,  he didn't sell that day.

AUSTRAILIA - Old power plant locks up again - for Bitcoins,"Old power plant locks up again - for Bitcoins
In fact, Singleton's Redbank coal-fired power plant in Australia has been shut down in 2014 due to environmental concerns - identified as the largest CO2 sinner among all Australian power plants in 2007. At the beginning of 2019, however, it will go online again. The reason: investors want to produce cheap electricity for the bitcoin industry.

Blockchain center directly in the power plant
The plan of the two partners: They want to open a ""blockchain center"" in the power plant - in which Blockchain is the decentralized database technology behind the Bitcoin - which is to be supplied with cheap electricity from the power plant, which is expected to go online in early 2019 , Bitcoins could be mined in the center, but other blockchain applications could be run as well.

Competitive - Right now the Bitcoin scene is concentrating on North China, where you also have very cheap electricity from coal power available - you want it to be particularly low electricity prices. When the Redbank power plant back on the grid, they want to sell the electricity produced there - or at least a significant part of it - at wholesale prices, about 20 percent below the usual market price, to blockchain companies.",1523688297,14/04/2018 06:44:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c5x0n/austrailia_old_power_plant_locks_up_again_for/,3

"Where is Bitlicense Now? A Brief Overview of Who is Attacking Bitcoin in the United States, and Viable Alternatives to Bitlicense.","Rather than a wall of text or another article on why I oppose bitlicense, including the variety which Coin Ctr and the ULC have been pumping - I've explained quite thoroughly in the past why their proposals are such a bad idea - this post will just explain the current status of Bitlicense in various states where it has emerged as well as a couple reasonable alternatives which, if pursued, could actually effectively squash most Bitlicense proposals.

(This is still a bit of a wall of text, but only because it takes a bit of text to summarize the various proposals for bitlicense pending in various U.S. states.  If they hadn't proposed all these, this post wouldn't be as long.)

*EDIT:  I am noticing brigading against some of my posts.  Please be civil and stop serially downvoting my posts, you have better things to do with your time.  Mods of r/bitcoin if you notice this please observe those who are engaging in brigading, which is prohibited by reddit.*


As a general observation and summary, Coin Ctr and other pro-bitlicense people saw how hard (and how successfully!) we fought against bitlicense in California, and so they realized eventually they might be more successful at getting bitlicense passed in smaller, less populated states, like Nebraska, Hawaii, or Alaska - in hopes that they would be able to sneak it through without much opposition and then claim a victory of sorts to then use as justification in other states where they are attempting state-level bitlicense.  Unrepentant statists are nothing if not sneaky folk, and attempting to ramrod bitlicense through in smaller states (because they couldn't win in California) is an example of their vile nature in action.

1) New York bitlicense - passed by rulemaking bodies in that unenlightened state, and being challenged in the courts.  Status here: http://www.article78againstnydfs.com/

2) California bitlicense - proposed three times, and under different bills (as AB 1326 (2015-2016) and as AB 1123 (2017-2018)), was repeatedly defeated with the aid of EFF, the Bitcoin Foundation, various other private and public organizations and nonprofits, and literally hundreds of thousands of individuals over multiple years.  Better than that, we also got rid of the bills' primary advocate and ""author,"" Dababneh (see [this post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqo92/some_good_news_in_bitcoin_land_californias_ab/)), and he will not be coming back to the State Legislature in California.  (Unfortunately, the bankers that funded him when he was in office, are still around.)

3) Connecticut -- bitlicense [has been introduced](https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;which_year=2018&amp;bill_num=5496) in a joint effort by the Coin Center and the Uniform Law Commission.  It's right now in a Banking Committee there.  If you live in Connecticut and enjoy any sort of crypto, write your legislators and tell them to put that bill in the trash pile and now.

4) [Hawaii bitlicense introduced](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=2129&amp;year=2018), another one being pushed by Coin Ctr and ULC.  This one the status of it is (for the moment) it didn't make it past committee and was deferred in early February 2018, but it could easily come back later for reconsideration.  If you live in Hawaii, keep the pressure on your legislators to stop any form of this uncouth proposal.  Kill it with fire of the magma of Hawaii.

5) [Nebraska bitlicense introduced](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=34121), another gross blot upon the earth and offense to humankind being pushed on a small state by Coin Ctr and ULC.  It appears to have gone through a first reading and may have gone off to another committee for review, but it hasn't had any action since early February 2018.  Please ensure you contact any friends you have in Nebraska to urge them to oppose LB 987, and if you live in Nebraska, please also oppose LB 987, as it is a most unpleasant insult on people's freedoms everywhere. 

Lest we forget...

6) [Alaska bitlicense](https://legiscan.com/AK/text/HB180/id/1560140), which has been introduced and referred to the Judiciary Committee by that State's legislature, and I suspect, by an effort involving the ULC.  Alaskans have the distinction, like Californians, of having defeated bitlicense before -- and they can do it again.  Please help spread the word about this terrible proposal, which involves and proposes bitcoin users would have to go through the ""Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry"" -- in case you don't know what that is, it's basically a for-profit licensing and registration system run by -- you guessed it - banksters -- here it is: https://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/Pages/default.aspx and here are the group of banksters that are promoting this one: NONE OTHER THAN THE CONFERENCE OF STATE BANK SUPERVISORS. https://www.csbs.org/about  That's right, the banksters want to license Alaskan bitcoiners to death - no doubt, with the full backing of pro-bitlicense people in Coin Ctr and the ULC.

Here's an example of a small state which, because we failed to advocate hard enough for our bitcoiners there (maybe because we weren't paying attention to what was happening in that state), fell prey to just a horrible bitlicense proposal that managed to get passed:  North Carolina's bitlicense, H289 -- which has been in effect since June 2016. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/58e7ms/the_problem_with_north_carolina_bitcoin/

ALTERNATIVES TO DUMB LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS LIKE THOSE ABOVE

1) CryptoCurrency Security Standard.  https://cryptoconsortium.org/standards/CCSS Developed by some of the brightest minds in bitcoin, could be adapted and modified by exchanges to be utilized by them voluntarily.

2) Some other voluntary standard, which could be adopted by major exchanges (and applicable worldwide).  If people adopt their own standards voluntarily that establish more security where most people go to get their coins, it is harder for bitlicense proponents to make the argument that their state-level proposals make any sense.

Thanks for reading!

Edit:  Please [contact EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/contact) and ask them politely to send letters to the State legislatures above to oppose the various bitlicense proposals.",1523688491,14/04/2018 06:48:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c5xhb/where_is_bitlicense_now_a_brief_overview_of_who/,0

I can think of a sample solution where each node keeps a ledger and they all constantly reach consensus between them to verify which one is correct - but I guess that would require a node to talk to ALL other nodes, or at least a majority.

First Surf camp in Portugal to accept Bitcoin - Baleal Surf Camp,"""This makes us the first Surf camp in Portugal to accept Bitcoin and only among few to do so in the whole world.” -  Baleal Surf Camp Founder 

Baleal Surf Camp can be found in Peniche, Portugal and here: http://www.balealsurfcamp.com/
Coinmap.org listing: coinmap.org/venue/13559

More info: https://www.cryptodome.net/bitcoin/peniche-bitcoin-portugal-surf/ 

More words from the founder himself:
""To properly celebrate this and because we surfers are very similar to cypherpunks in spirit, during our current mid-season all our clients that use crypto to pay will receive additional 25% off discount on our packages. That discount is on top of all the current promotions that we have."" - Baleal Surf Camp Founder 

They are celebrating 25 years in business with 25% off.
On top of that using Bitcoin gets you another 25% discount. Using BTC here is the smart thing both for them to implement and for you to use when paying for your dream surf holiday.

As the ones handling their implementation we cannot be more thrilled then to see new clients like Baleal Surf Camp recognising Bitcoin for what it is &gt;&gt; the real future.

Show the Baleal guys some love and support by commenting.

"Announcing my first bitcoin project, Blockhash.WIN","I'm in the last year of a software engineering study. I followed the open innovation minor the study provides, where I can basically choose any subject that I want to learn about, and make something :). For me that subject was blockchain, being in bitcoin for almost 5 years triggered my interest to really learn about the tech behind it. 

When I started with the minor I was a little clueless about what exactly blockchain was good for, hearing mixed things about it online for so long. On one side blockhain promises huge potential for all sorts of usecases but when I started looking in to it I realized that there really aren't that many legit usecases and that money and bitcoin is what the discussion should really be about. BITCOIN IS THE KILLER APP. 

Teachers weren't very exited about my findings in the first place and kept pushing that there must be a lot of other things blockchain is good for, it took me a while to gather the right arguments to convince them that they shouldn't be looking a blockchain but instead focus a bit more(if not completely) on bitcoin. 
Anyway, one idea that stood out and that fitted limited time that I had in the minor was a gambling site, using the block hash as a random source. Not a new concept but I figured it would be a good one to learn about the tech. 
So I created https://www.blockhash.win/ . You can earn 2x your bet amount by guessing the right last digit of the blockhash that includes your transaction. I've spend many hours developing and I've learned a lot. I would recommend any software engineer or student like me to learn about the tech and build somthing.
I learned a lot from the book that I picked up for this minor: Mastering bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (I would really recommend the book if your a software guy or just technical!) 


I'm open for feedback and I'm really curious what you guys think of it, let me know :) 
If you would like to get started developing something bitcoin and don't know where to get started, hit me up!

Warning: Spam attack from 2016 has resumed,"Since about 09:00 UTC, [40 MB of transactions](https://core.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#8h) have been added to the mempool. Vegard from the LND slack pointed out [this transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/388bcd15a6097e9114231f6b3b74619a0f658a354bdd58ce0cca4b1ad7297d42), which certainly *looks* like spam, but perhaps it's legitimate. After all, it did pay a 332 sat/B(!) fee, which is *quite* high right now.

However, if you investigate, you'll notice some other oddities. Look at the [transaction the input references](https://blockchain.info/tx/f9756737261067ecfc54a587d8c65bb6bc7c0d73b83d49b21bf029ea597a70b8). Of those outputs that are spent, most are included with outputs from numerous other addresses, all containing 0.0001 BTC. They all spend to the same address, 1P3rU1Nk1pmc2BiWC8dEy9bZa1ZbMp5jfg and all have an OP_RETURN output. Again, it looks strange but I'm not certain the precise purpose of the OP_RETURN.

What leads me to believe that this is (one of?) the same spammer(s?) from 2016? Look at the [history](https://blockchain.info/address/1HmixPDLTcVSqiyne2JFLj1F1hKVmpC1pU?offset=9550&amp;filter=6) of the primary address 1HmixPDLTcVSqiyne2JFLj1F1hKVmpC1pU. This **exact same behavior** dates back to November 2016. It appears they've been consolidating their outputs (the fan-in part of the 2-stage attack [explained by LaurentMT](https://medium.com/@laurentmt/good-whale-hunting-d3cc3861bd6b)). Now they've begun another round of the fan-out attack.

Beware the ""mempool is full"" FUD that will be arriving, and ensure that you're using a wallet that sanely calculates fees. You can use tools like [Johoe's mempool visualizer](https://core.jochen-hoenicke.de) to manually determine the fee you'll need to *probably* get in the next block or two by looking at the number of bytes above a specific fee level.",1523721819,14/04/2018 16:03:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c8gk6/warning_spam_attack_from_2016_has_resumed/,4

BTCJam the massive scam and fraud that nobody is talking about,"BTC Jam ended up being a massive scam.   At first I thought it was acting a bit weird, then I looked in detail at my account.         

BTCJam closed last year suddenly.   What was alarming, is the amount of defaulted loans I had been awarded, nearly every Bitcoin i lent on the site went unpaid back.  That is fine, I understand that might happen, but then it got greasier.      

I looked into the arbitration notices I was awarded -  Arbitration notices from a ""lawyer firm"" saying the debtor owes the creditor.  Well, that is where they used a fake law firm, a law firm that doesn't exist at all.  It's completely fake and the arbitration notices are completely useless.    

Then I looked back at what I was owed.  The account shows 3 important things - AMOUNT LENT, AMOUNT PAID, REMAINING BALANCE.  A simple equation.  Well to my alarm, the amount lent wouldn't line up with ANY of the remaining balances or the amount paid - BTCJam was spoofing these numbers to say that far more of the loan was paid off then actually was.        

I am not sure what to do but this seems  like a pretty big case of fraud IMO.   I understand the risks of using a Bitcoin lending platform, but it's completely different if a few users are defaulting compared to if the website was created to cheat people out of money with a fraudulent front.  And BTCJam was clearly involved with taking out money.

Why I Decided to Run a BTC Full Node,"""Ask not what Bitcoin can do for you, ask what you can do for Bitcoin.""  –  John F. KenNODEy

I've slowly started to fall down the rabbit hole with Bitcoin.  I bought my first coin in early 2017, and since then, I have slowly poured a decent portion of my discretionary income into it as well as read most of the books on the subject.  I get it – I have a solid understanding of how it all works and how disruptive it will be.

However, I work in finance and would not consider myself great with technology.  I'm not going to learn how to code, I'm never going to be contributing to the open source code, and I'm not quitting my job to work for Coinbase or some crypto fund.  Aside from spreading the good word, I wish I could do something to help accelerate Bitcoin's growth besides laying on my couch refreshing my Blockfolio app 25x a day.

After reading ""Mastering Bitcoin"", I started to look into full nodes and why anybody would even want to run one of these things.  Here is a good article I found on ""6 Reasons to Run Bitcoin Full Node"":  [http://bitcoinist.com/6\-reasons\-run\-bitcoin\-full\-node/](http://bitcoinist.com/6-reasons-run-bitcoin-full-node/).

Here are the cliff notes:

1. Helps strengthen the network
2. You can set up a more trustworthy wallet on it
3. You can vote if a hard fork comes
4. Higher degree of privacy
5. It's not that hard
6. It's not that expensive.

I found the Bitseed 3 through some research:  [https://bitseed.org/product/bitseed\-3/](https://bitseed.org/product/bitseed-3/).  I was looking for a plug\-n\-play model where I could pay some money, plug it in, and be done with it.  It cost $359 in total.  I know most people are able to run a full node at a cheaper cost, but not being tech\-savvy, I needed something easy and ready to go.  I read a few articles and watched some videos and was able to plug it into my AT&amp;T router and open the 8333 port.  This is not a Bitseed commercial, I am sure there are other solid products out there as well.

So far, it's been great, and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I'd add on a few more reasons to run a full node:

7.  Relative to the amount of $ I have invested in Bitcoin, $359 is a small price to do my part to support the network.  For the general population, it is probably one of the best ways we can help.

8.  It will help you better understand Bitcoin.  To really see it happen \(block height, connecting to other nodes, propagating transactions across the network, etc.\), you get a better perspective of how things really work under the hood.

9.  Supposedly, it helps lightning network, as a stronger/bigger infrastructure can help support more/quicker transactions on the lightning layer.

9.  More nodes for BTC sticks it to BCH. \(suck it\)

10.  Its cool to rep the brand.  I put a Bitcoin sticker on the device, and it's a great conversation starter.  I see it like repping your favorite sports team memorabilia in your room.

You to girl at bar: ""Yo, wanna come check out my full node?""

Girl: ""mmmmmyaaaa like sureeeeee""

You:  ""Tight.  I can show you my Bitseed 3, too.""

Bitcoin is the future.  Hopefully everybody can find a way to do his/her part to support its growth.  Peace, love, &amp; BTC. ",1523743426,14/04/2018 22:03:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cauay/why_i_decided_to_run_a_btc_full_node/,5

"Back in 2014, a ""friend"" laundered 10k of cash through my PayPal and gave me a stipend.","Continued from title.

I was naive to his intentions, and just wanted the quick cash. I knew he was in at the ground-floor of bitcoin, but I never thought anything of it. 

Eventually my PayPal got shut down because of the cash laundering and I didn't give him back a 2k balance because I was selling a lot on eBay at the time and it cut down my cash flow immensely.

He was buying large volume of BTC through circle using cash laundered through my PayPal, something you can't do any longer.

He's probably hodling and millionaire right now, probably evading taxes.

This dude pretended to be my friend and ""help me out"" when he made me liable for the laundered money attached. to my PayPal.

Should I rat him out to the IRS? (Form 3949-A)

Am I liable or could I get in trouble myself for not having declared that money in my PayPal to the IRS back in that tax year? I am a good tax monkey, and always pay what I owe, but I'm concerned if I get audited that this could come back to bite me one year.

What 2 do?",1523755168,15/04/2018 01:19:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cc06m/back_in_2014_a_friend_laundered_10k_of_cash/,1
Here’s why bitcoin is here to stay and why crypto will take a grip of the global $90 trillion money supply,"Money supply now is $90 T. Global asset wealth is $280T. Derivatives market is $1.2 quadrillion. 

Even if money supply stays around $100 T, Bitcoin could take all of it theoretically. Crypto as a whole could take all of it over time. 

Let’s say crypto takes $10T. 

It’s less than $400B right now. 

Bitcoin is less than $200B. 

Bitcoin is a safe buy. I’m buying undervalued projects mostly, have owned bitcoin in the past. 

Crypto is Not a bubble. It’s a replacement for fractional reserve banking that even the banks are buying into. 

It’s a replacement fueled by technology elucidating what money is without a system to uphold it: worthless; it’s a replacement fueled by hype, by greed; it’s a replacement fueled by the necessities of security taking into account the advent of quantum computing and AI.

Bitcoin is here to stay. If it isn’t, cryptocurrency as a whole is.

Possible scam with Ledger Manager chrome app?,"The 'Ledger manager' is a Chrome app for the managing of Ledger products. If you go to the Ledger website ledgerwallet.com you will (eventually) find a link leading you to the Chrome App. But if you search for 'Ledger Manager' in the Chrome web store, you will find (only 1) App with that name, and uploaded from a user named ""ovsanzh4"". This seems suspicious, as the Ledger apps are uploaded under user name ""www.ledgerwallet.com"". If you downloaded the Ledger Manager by looking for it in the web store, please be careful. Ideally remove it and follow the link to the app in the official Ledger web site. I don't know how the search functionality in the Chrome shop works, but if that is really a rogue app, Ledger should definetely make sure that users are getting at least the correct result (together maybe with ""scamming"" ones).

How to cause the downfall of the modern financial system and society as we know it.,"Thanks to fractional reserve banking only 10% (roughly) of people own the money in their bank accounts. If everyone, tomorrow, was to go to the bank and take out the money in thier bank accounts, the financial system and society as we know it would collapse.

This is called a bank run. Past bank runs are usually caused by an erosion of trust in a particular bank. Once trust is gone and money starts being pulled out of a bank en masse the loss of faith is actualised and then the bank is declared insolvent.

A mass run on all banks worldwide would shut down the financial sector overnight and society as we know it would collapse.

It boggles the mind to think it could all end by such a simple thing as withdrawing cash.",1523799695,15/04/2018 13:41:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cf6ws/how_to_cause_the_downfall_of_the_modern_financial/,6

"The market experiencing significant issues, the biggest one is You.","We all know how checking a chart can cause pain or provide a lot of happiness right?
The most significant reason causing many unexpectable movements one way or another is: YOU. People were writing celebrations to each other and dreaming about Lambo"", forgetting how couple days ago they talked about the end. Numbers so-called Crypto Guru wrote about ""accurate"" but most likely out of space technical analysis that has nothing to deal with reality and the real world.
Professional traders advising to leave emotions elsewhere but not at work, because fear and emotions will not let you make cold and right decisions even if you think you are acting right, you don't, let me tell you that.

Stop overthinking about whales or other typical excuses you have everytime market makes a move. Every single one of you is making an impact on these movements. Fear and joy you are experiencing, every day is two super different feelings which is the hard thing to deal with.
The good news is it's not your fault if you end up the day with another failure. Thousands of years in Evolution made you feel and use fear,  run before it's not too late.
Remember if you think you're smarter than the ones who posted a signal... You lost before you even got here let me tell you that... Emotions ( sad or happy )  won't help in cryptomarket, it's a slaughterhouse just like it's always been. If that's the first thing you think to invest to?

At what point do banks need to start worrying about a global bank run.,"Buying bitcoin has the same economic effect as storing cash under your mattress.

In the world we live in where fractional reserve banking is the norm, banks only hold 3% to 10% of our deposits as vault cash. The rest is used to generate profits for the bank mainly by lending it out to new borrowers.

Now we all know if a certain percentage of the population in any country withdrew their money out of the banks these banks would have to stop withdrawals to remain solvent.

I have a feeling that one of the big bull runs we have in the future may actually trigger a multi-country bank run simultaneously.

Im sure this is THE reason banks hate on bitcoin so much. Because a mega bull run in bitcoin could literally force them to close their doors, block withdrawals and start asking for bailouts again. It would also expose to the public that their money in their bank account is not really there at all.

So if you ever wondered why banks talk shit about bitcoin and block transfers to exchanges, realise its because they are so fragile one big bitcoin bull run could make them insolvent and unable to operate overnight.

I take give Intel in exchange for a few dollars worth of bitcoin,"I am an intel broker and my job is to provide intel on a specific number of interesting topics, for a small price. I possess a great wealth of information in the form of files on topics like spying, assassination, espionage, explosives, leaks, databases,secret files, survival, crime scene investigation and a number of other similar natured files. This kind of knowledge is possessed by only a limited number of civilians and i personally believe that we all should be armed with it so that we can be prepared to face a time of crisis. Also these are only a few examples of the type of intel i possess and have access to, if need be i can also collect more intel online if the job requires it. For more information either pm me or contact me at my email: spectre01@protonmail.com. It is also to be noted that i take only a few dollars worth of bitcoin for payment and in return will provide a good amount of intel.

Bitcoin.com / Simplex advice needed,"Hey guys. I'm still fairly new to the whole buying btc process. I've purchased several times, never had any hiccups, until today that is.  As im trying to research my problem, my inexperience is really starting to make it all overwhelmingly confusing. So I thought I'd come to you awesome people for advice.

I put in an order for some BTC from bitcoin.com using my MasterCard. It redirected me to a different page (Simplex) to do the transaction. Next page asked me to do a few things for identity verification, (Pic of ID, ect.) No prob at all, I had it to back to them within minutes. Was then redirected back to bitcoin.com, it says transaction is being processed.

Fast forward 4 hours later, and I've got an email from Simplex saying bitcoin.com has canceled my order and no, they can't tell me why. Problem is, I've already been charged. The FAQs &amp; help topics on both named websites are quite vauge and dont really give me a clear starting point. I'm not sure what I should do or even expect. Do I contact Simplex or bitcoin.com? Will I get the money back? How long does this type of thing take? I really needed the funds for something important TODAY, which I think is the main source of my anxiety at the moment.  Please forgive me guys, I dont usually go into full on panic mode like this. But the urgency in my neediing it, and amount has me a nervous wreck. Does anyone have any advice? Suggestions?  Has anyone ever had this problem? Any insight would be very much appreciated. 

tl;dr - I purchased btc througb bitcoin.com using a card.  Was sent to Simplex for the transaction. 4 hour later received email from Simplex that bitcoin.com canceled order, yet I was already charged.  Advice?

I  have been downloading the blockchain at a friends house all weekend, it is 77% complete, but I am getting ready to head home. I have read that it is okay to pause the download and resume it later. Would it be safe to pause the download, and resume it later on a different internet connection? Seems like it would be okay to me, but I am not that smart, and I want to know for sure since it is 77% done already! Thanks for any advice",1523824037,15/04/2018 20:27:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8chyu1/quick_question_about_syncing_the_blockchain_for_a/,3

"BTC exchanging ""methods/strategies?"" (yes I'm newb)","So I was doing some research on the wannacry ransomware that happened about a year ago. This simply out of boredom on a sunday afternoon. Anyway what picked my interests were the 3 BTC addresses to which transactions took place. 

So while trying to learn a bit about blockchain transactions I inspected the BTC received and send. I mean if a criminal receives money on an address and eventually sends it to a different one then it is highly possible that the desire to withdraw the funds is present. Anyway this is not what I am here for.

The transactions from the paying addresses went to a couple of random addresses and this went on for 4-5 times. An example with non factual numbers: thief address received 210BTC from payments from ransomware. He send 190 to address 1. Address 1 send 160 to address 2 and a bunch to various others. Address 2 did the same with a smaller amount to address 3 etc. 

So each of these addresses had eventually the same address that received huge chunks. They had transactions inbetween with other addresses that had transactions with the first main addresses. 

All this confusing address BTC exchanges isn't related but it led me to a particular address that keeps exchanging BTC back and forth with the same address. I am talking about 100s of BTC's. Is this like a method for people to do? Or a strategy? I couldn't find anything about why someone would want to transfer BTC x from A to B to A to B to A to B to infinity. So my first question would be, why do this? Doesn't each exchange cost a small bit of BTC, making the address lose money? 

Looking down on the exchange numbers I scrolled down since I was simply baffled by the amount worth of BTC that was going around in these trades. Like converted... I'd probably never see that amount of money in my entire existence. But then I encountered an even weirder exchange. And I might not understand this fully but this particular address was sending BTC back to his own address as well? Like A sends to A and B to A and B, to A and B. And in between it received from like 100+ addresses a total of 800+ BTC which goes through the same routine AB -&gt; AB -&gt; AB etc. Why would a method like this be used? 

Look I am not looking to gain anything or so, I am simply just curious, going by the irregular timestamps it doesn't seem to be automated either. Isn't this extremely tedious? 

The crazy A -&gt; AB -&gt; AB address in question is https://blockchain.info/address/1EEqRvnS7XqMoXDcaGL7bLS3hzZi1qUZm1
The other address that was linked to my research is https://blockchain.info/en/address/3JjPf13Rd8g6WAyvg8yiPnrsdjJt1NP4FC?offset=150&amp;filter=6

I am not interested in my research, but simply in their behaviour. The research part was simply a backstory as of how stumbled accross this. 
I am a weird person to find enjoyment in this. Don't judge me. Also I am fairly new to blockchain itself so please if you explain something try to act like I am your old grandma (no offence). 

I would give you a cookie if I could since you read my wall. But ehh... have a virtual one! ;-) Either way, thanks in advance!

Probabilities &amp; expected value of BTC price,"As many of you know the renowned Tim Draper has predicted that BTC’s price will be $250k by 2022.

Let’s assume there is only a 10% chance that Draper’s prediction is will come true and a 90% chance that price will be in the same spot in 4 years.

Expected value = EV

$250,00 – 10% chance=, EV = $25,000 $8300 – 90% chance , EV = $7,470

Total expect value on holding 4 years from today = $32,470 That makes for a compound annual growth rate of =($32,740/$8,300)1/4 = 97.80%

If we make all of the above assumptions, and also assuming a generous historical stock market growth rate of 7.5%, BTC’s total return will be 13 times that of what the stock market will yield over the next 4 years . It's a fucking great time to be alive ladies and gents!

Rise in Bitcoin Price: ‘April 17 Decides the future of Bitcoin’-Expert Reveals,"The recent rise in Bitcoin has attracted a lot of concern from many experts as one ofthem claimed that the price of the currency could surge even higher in few days.

On Thursday, Bitcoin price surged from $6,786 on Thursday morning to a high of $8,011 effort night of the same day, which was more than 17 percent in an unusual spike.

One of the bitcoin expert, identified as Brian Kelly, the CEO of BKCM, revealed that the price of Bitcoin could rise further this month, as the US Tax Day looms.

In a statement with CNBC, Kelly, said;

“We’re early stage tech in this - this is like the internet in the 1980s.

“After the last couple of months talking to folks, I think we’re more like the 1980s.

“I think this technology is going to work, it is going to be game-changing.It is very early days so we can have this mass of volatility.”

Mr Kelly further said;

“I think this is for real, so we’ll know presumably after April 17 if we can hold these gains.We will know how much that was selling impacted.”

Now on 17th of April is acknowledged in the US as “Tax Day”- it is the deadline for those in America to file their 2017 federal tax returns.

In reaction to this, Mr Kelly said;

“We probably have 500 to 600 billion dollars come off the market for tax purposes and we have had that since December.

“It looks like we have bottomed here and there definitely seems to be a change in the sentiment around it so I think this is the real thing.This is an open source software so you can’t think of it as a company and that is where people make the mistake.”

Reports have it that for the last 10 weeks the correlation between stock markets and Bitcoin has indicated the cryptocurrency is still being perceived as a risk asset as opposed to a safe haven asset like gold.This is due to the volatile nature of the market and because it is still largely unregulated.

History of the blockchain in the description.,"Maxnetlabs
Published by Maxnet Labs · 1 hr · 
History of Blockchain:

The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks as described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several documents to be collected into one block.

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. It was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network. Through the use of a blockchain, bitcoin became the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without requiring a trusted authority and has been the inspiration for many additional applications.

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes). In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.

Former App Store director just mentioned the story of crypto users shooting their phones at a conference,"I'm at an iOS conference in Switzerland, and the opening talk was from a former Senior Director of App Store at Apple. He was telling various stories of what apps were getting rejected for, and he mentioned when cryptocurrency wallets were not allowed, when a large exchange's app was removed for including a wallet (Coinbase I guess?), and then some angry crypto fans started recording videos of shooting or otherwise destroying their iPhones.

The conclusion? ""From the moment we saw that viral video to when we started approving cryptocurrency apps, it took 12 hours. Apple always listens when people threaten to stop buying their phones"" :)

We are a small fintech company looking to bring cryptocurrency payment to the mainstream. To get to know the playing field better, we decided to conduct a humble survey on crypto usage habits: 

## **How often do token holders use crypto? How much do they HODL? What are the main obstacles for wider payment adaptation?**

With more than a hundred respondents, coming mainly from the US, EU and Asia, here’s what we found. When it comes to demographics, the **typical cryptocurrency user is**:

- male, between the ages 25 and 34, and holds a bachelor’s degree.
- he can be **profiled as a cryptocurrency investor**, investing in various ICOs and tokens.
- he **HODLs between $1,000 and $10,000** worth of tokens.
- he has never used cryptocurrency for payment of goods and services (*Yes, 56% of respondents never-ever used crypto as a currency. How crazy is that.*).

Furthermore, when it comes to **widespread crypto adaptation**:

- The typical cryptocurrency user sees a complex set of limitations for using crypto more for payments, including wanting to hold onto investments (HODL), the volatility of crypto assets and the lack of payment acceptance points.
- However, there is real intent of using crypto more, depending on whether any of these limitations are being solved.

The study also takes a look at usage habits and behaviour:

- Crypto investors (token owners) prefer not to use their assets in real life as much as business owners (startups with ICOs, token issuers), freelancers (those who get paid in crypto) or service providers (those who accept crypto as payment).

HODL On: In Defense of Bitcoin's Best Investment Strategy,"https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-in-defense-of-hodlers/

Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.

In 1987's Black Monday stock market crash, Sam Walton, the world's richest man, lost more than half a billion dollars in a few hours.

When reached for comment, Walton said, ""It's paper anyway. As far as I'm concerned we're focusing totally on the company doing well and taking care of our customers.""

He didn't care about dollars; he cared about his asset Wal-Mart, and he still owned that.

History of the #HODL
In bitcoin's volatile and roller coaster past, ""HODL"" was the meme that bound the cryptocurrency community together. It stood for the proposition that we all believe in the future of bitcoin. It's both funny and insightful.

Here is the original post by GameKyuubi on a Bitcoin Talk forum (spelling errors and profanity included):

I AM HODLING

I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying ""OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD"" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

so i've had some whiskey

actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

w/e

sue me

(But only if it's payable in BTC)

It was not about bitcoin versus bitcoin cash or 1,000 other cryptocurrencies. It was bitcoin vs. the world and we ALL embraced it.

It only took 11 minutes for this post to become a meme that became the rallying cry for the entire crypto world. We were all on the same rollercoaster ride and GameKyuubi, in the depths of his frustration, had (sort of) elegantly articulated both what it feels like and the best trading strategy for an asset this volatile.

Buy and HODL.

The good traders
GameKyuubi was wrong about only one thing: There aren't any good traders.

There are lots of us who believe we are good traders. But we aren't. Of course, some of the loudest voices on Reddit regularly remind us about how well they time the market. Except when they don't time the market well.

A paper published last October by the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley entitled ""Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?"" used nearly 15 years of stock market day trading data to conclude that all day traders are irrational, the vast majority of day traders lose money, and even when day traders are successful, they ""irrationally attribute success disproportionately to their ability rather than luck.""

This sounds exactly like the crypto trader. Any post you see mocking HODL is likely someone who thinks they are really smart because they made money by trading crypto last year.

Of course, their success was due to their unique trading ability and not the fact that the entire market rose like a rocket.

HODLing works
Still, empirically, even in volatile assets like bitcoin, carefully choosing an asset and holding long-term positions has proven to offer the best return.

Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of modern times, has often said that he only invests in what he knows. His preferred holding period: forever. With that model, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has averaged a 19 percent annual return since 1965 which means it has risen more than 1 million percent.

Theoretical models that assume participants know when markets will move against them can offer better returns but, in practice, market movements cannot be reliably predicted so even when people like Bernie Madoff try to make us think that they've figured it out, they haven't.

Long-term investment in quality assets remains the only reliable investment strategy.

Simply put, HODLing works.

More possibilities
For those not interested in limiting their activity to HODLing, there are two new and useful ideas that have begun bouncing around that really do advance cryptocurrencies: #BUIDL and #SPEDN.

BUIDL has been used to help remind us that, in the words of a CypherPunk's Manifesto, ""Cypherpunks write code."" In order for the blockchain to really be useful and valuable, we need to build stuff on it. Watching the price go up and down either as a trader or a HODLer does nothing to make bitcoin work better.

We need to create some of the promised applications that can really change the world. To date, the blockchain community has fallen short in this regard outside of the areas of payments but there are some real wins.

Just this weekend, Voatz, a Medici Ventures portfolio company is running party county convention voting in Utah, state convention voting in Michigan and state primary voting for overseas and military voters in West Virginia, all on a blockchain platform.

Blockchain voting is a simple application, but it is one that can bring a much-needed security and transparency to elections. And we are doing it now.

SPEDN is a nod to the many of us who realize that, for bitcoin to be useful, we need to be able to spend it to buy things. And I mean everything. It really doesn't matter whether it is through second-layer solutions like lightning or forks like bitcoin cash; we need more ways to use cryptocurrencies in real-world transactions.

A focus here, rather than complaining about HODLers would be helpful. We need many more merchants to accept cryptocurrency before it becomes useful. Options to spend bitcoin remain severely limited in most areas and this will ultimately limit bitcoin's value.

As for me, I will HODL until I can buy useful stuff and SPEDN.

HODL on
This year has seen intense regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies and its time we stop pretending that HODL was stupid. It isn't and it wasn't. Anyone who doesn't like the HODL mentality needs to give HODLers something else they can do with their bitcoins.

Trading is no solution for intelligent people. What we need are new ways to use cryptocurrency.

We need BUIDLers and merchants who will let us be SPEDNers.",1523869564,16/04/2018 09:06:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cm6qe/hodl_on_in_defense_of_bitcoins_best_investment/,3

Bitcoin rose to $8000 again. The turnover is increasing rapidly.,"Bitcoin continued its rise as last trading day on April, 13, and broke through $8000. [Bitcoin value](https://www.coindesk.com/bitmain-gets-go-ahead-us-bitcoin-mining-operation/) has been going up continuously recently, which makes the market of cryptocurrency alive again. The data showed that the turnover of Bitcoin achieved 10 billion dollars this week, while the average turnover per week was 5 billion dollars in the past. 


Although Bitcoin is recovering, industry sources predict that [Bitcoin price](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin) will go up continuously. The CEO of CoinShare, Danny Masters claimed that the market of cryptocurrency will recover, because more and more blockchain technique will be commercial, which increases the investors’ confidence. 


In a few months, the price of Bitcoin declined by 65% compared with the end of 2017. Many factors lead to underselling, and the time for revenue is one of the reasons. Because the capital gains taxes of taxpayers are more than the predicted number, Bitcoin owners found that they have to sell more property to pay the taxes.

The barriers towards the acceptance of cryptocurrencies within most European economies r/CryptoCurrency,"I am a Master student, focusing on the macroeconomic barriers that cryptocurrencies currently face to reach mass adoption within the german economy.  My research on the topic has identified 3 main pillars (see below) that demonstrate to have negatively impacted the adoption of cryptocurrencies within the German economy. 


1.Intrinsic aspects of cryptocurrencies: This pillar mostly entitles the perceptions of the users. Cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, have unique characteristics due to their distributed ledger technology (blockchain) and decentralization, which, according to my findings perceivably creates an unsecure, unfamiliar and unregulatable (criminal) playfield for most of its users. 

2.Functions of Money: Whereas most cryptocurrencies provide a strong potential to act as a better medium of exchange than any other form of money, it’s limited supply and un-regulatory characteristics make most cryptocurrencies a less valuable unit of account and store of value, due to high price fluctuations that are sorely affected by the demand of its users.

3.External forces: Government regulations and negative sentiment of national media has communicated Bitcoin as being a risky financial asset (investment) and highlighted its limited usage to act as a currency. According to my research, German citizens have a strong saving culture and high trust in the Euro, and foremostly neglect risky financial investments. A further lack of retailers, who accept cryptocurrencies as payment, has dispirited a potential network effect, which is a fundamental requirement towards a successful adoption of new technology. 

For my empirical research, I am looking for experts (who are active in the field of cryptocurrencies and/or economics) who can support me on this. 

Through a 20-minute exploratory expert interview, I would like to discuss 3 barriers in detail with you. These are listed below:
1. Bitcoin (or similar cryptocurrencies) and their function as a money (medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account)
2. Intrinsic aspects of cryptocurrencies (technology, perception of citizens, user-friendliness, hacks, crime, etc.)
3. The influence of external factors (regulations, press reports and the banking system)

The 20-minute interview will take place by phone or via Skype. The interviewee remains anonymous throughout the procedure. Directly identifiable personal information (name, profession, etc.) will be anonymized in published material, but indirect information (occupational field) relevant to the analysis may be published.

If you are interested, please send me a direct message so that I can already send you the focal points / questions of the research so that you have a better overview. Furthermore, as a thank you for your time you will be rewarded in Bitcoins (of course) with a value of 5 euros. If you are not available for an interview, you can also send the answers back to me in writing. The interview can be done in german or english.

Smearing Bitcoin owners. Tax cheats.,"Over the past year, a repeating trend within the news articles that I see, is that the IRS claims that only a very small fraction of Bitcoin owners have been reporting their earnings. The claim is due to repeat itself this year as far as I can tell.

I just saw an article making reporting that out of 250,000 people who did their taxes through credit karma, only a small handful of people reported Bitcoin earnings. From this, an illrepresened figure of 20 people, overall, are said to have claimed Bitcoin on their taxes this year so far, to the IRS. 20. 20!? Out of the entire USA population?! This number is obviously bs. When claiming Bitcoin earnings as a piece of property, there are multiple ways to report it, in the form of naming the piece of property (BTC, Bitcoin, crypto, digital currency, etc...), And I suspect that the figures they've given us VASTLY underreport how many people pay their taxes. It's easy to narrow your field of view on searching for the asset to just one keyword, and not see the rest. To give you an idea of what I'm talking about, if I had sold my classic corvetter for profit, this same spot on the fltax form is where I'd report that. If I had sold some jewelry for profit, same spot. This form is used for all types of property. Until there's a separate form for crypto currency, their numbers will always be wrong.

This is just another way to try and defeat Bitcoin. Nobody likes a tax cheats. Convince the country that BTC holders don't pay their taxes, and before you know it, you have large numbers of people against them. 

I personally pay my taxes on BTC. It's not an anonymous currency, and one day, (irs can look back 7 years) you may get caught. If regulation forces exchanges to hand over all of their customer data, everyone who didn't pay will be in for a wild ride. 

The point of this post isn't to convince you to pay your taxes, it's just to point out that the media wants to paint us as mostly tax cheats. I just don't think that's true at all. 

I wish they would give us the same type of figures on people who sell their antique gold jewelry, or gold bullion that they've held onto for years for a handsome profit. Or maybe those gambling winnings that don't hit the reporting threshold at casinos in Vegas. 

Or how about the hundreds of thousands of garage sales that happen every weekend where millions of dollars change hands. 

In summary, alot of people are paying their taxes. We are to believe that is not the case, but don't fuel the fire. Don't spread this form of FUD.",1523878626,16/04/2018 11:37:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cmuyg/smearing_bitcoin_owners_tax_cheats/,7

Confusion regarding taxing of Bitcoin earnings,"Hi,

"I’m Hoarding Bitcoins, and No You Can’t Have Any Daniel Krawisz February 12, 2014","http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/im-hoarding-bitcoins-and-no-you-cant-have-any/#selection-7.6-17.23

Those nasty hoarders! You know the ones. They won’t use bitcoins because they think they’ll be worth so much more later. But how can we convince businesses to accept bitcoins if no one will spend them? We need to guilt those hoarders into spending their bitcoins to support the merchants! This article is about why this line of reasoning is exactly wrong.

If You Sell Bitcoins, You Aren’t “Selling” Bitcoins
I’m sure you’ve heard a story like this. “I’ve been going to all the local stores and telling them how awesome Bitcoin is! But none of them wants to take payments in Bitcoin! Why don’t they like it?”

Let’s think about that for a minute. You are essentially telling the merchant, “Hey look at this totally awesome thing that I want to get rid of! You should trade me some stuff for it!” Not actually much of a sales pitch, is it? Why would the merchant want something that you, apparently, don’t want? If you really want him to start accepting bitcoins himself, ask him, “Do you take worthless paper money at this store? Good, because you’re not getting a satoshi from me!” That will convince him that you think they’re valuable.

How about this instead? Tell your local merchants that you want to be able to spend cash in their stores and get the change in bitcoins. That’s the kind of store I’d like to shop at. And then when the merchant later says “I’m not going to do that anymore. I want you to pay me in bitcoins!” you know he’s become a true hoarder.

Hoarders Give Bitcoin Value

The initial price of bitcoin was caused by people who wanted to hold it, not people who wanted to spend it. Furthermore, each subsequent step in Bitcoin’s advance must begin with more holders, not more spenders. The business that bitcoins can absorb is limited by its market cap. At a market cap of two or three billion dollars, Bitcoin can absorb many small businesses but it cannot be used for international oil trade. It would have to be dozens of times more expensive for that, and it can only achieve that if the peoples’ desire to hold bitcoins continues to increase faster than their desire to spend them. Thus, one who wants Bitcoin to become mainstream should never want its price to be lower. He should want an ever-increasing supply of hoarders.

It is true that Bitcoin’s price can occasionally and temporarily outpace the growth in its real prospects, but this is merely a byproduct of Bitcoin’s phenomenal success. A commodity which increases in price as quickly as bitcoins can be expected to experience shocks and manias on its way up because it would be difficult to tell the difference between a sustainable price increase and short-term speculation. However, does it make really sense to prefer an alternative history for Bitcoin in which its price has increased slowly enough that it never developed any manias? I do not see how that could possibly be preferable. The faster Bitcoin grows, the more complete and decisive will be its victories, and the more difficult it will be for its natural enemies to react to it.

Who Needs Merchants Anyway?
One of the most annoying things about Bitcoin is that it’s so convenient to make payments with it that sometimes it is extremely tempting to spend it and avoid the hassle of using dollars. One of the ways to help deal with the temptation to spend is to demand a Bitcoin discount at any store that accepts Bitcoin. This is perfectly reasonable because not only is the store lowering its own costs by using Bitcoin, but it is asking me to give up an inherently superior commodity.

Hoarders are more important than merchants. If a restaurant downtown starts accepting bitcoins, this does not necessarily create an incentive for anybody to buy more bitcoins. Why would anyone bother if they can still just use a credit card? If you can convince a merchant to accept bitcoins and stop accepting dollars, then I’ll be impressed.

Unless a merchant is offering something that cannot be bought for dollars, or at least offering a discount, he is only benefiting Bitcoin to the extent that he encourages more hoarding. If he immediately converts the bitcoins he receives as payment into dollars, and if his customers only buy bitcoins so as to spend them at his shop shortly thereafter, then neither has much direct effect on Bitcoin’s demand. The real hero is the hoarder behind the scenes who buys from the merchant and enables him to convert his payments into dollars.

Greed is Your Friend

There can be no spending of bitcoins without the buying of them, and thus all use of bitcoins as a medium of exchange depend on someone who wants to increase his holdings, i.e., a hoarder. Without them there could literally be no Bitcoin trade. Furthermore, it is counterproductive to try to turn hoarders into spenders. There really is no compelling reason that anybody should spend bitcoins any time soon—if everybody is hoarding, that will just make the price go up until finally someone can’t help spending some.

Currencies are unusual in that the greater is its market cap, the more useful they are. This is in contrast to a more ordinary security, such as a stock, because a stock has a better value the cheaper it is in relation to the underlying assets of the company. A more expensive currency is ipso facto more marketable (more liquid), thus making it a superior medium of exchange. The more bitcoin hoarding there is, the better it is as a medium of exchange.

Thus, the success of Bitcoin is, to some extent, a self-fulfilling prophesy. Belief in Bitcoin improves the Bitcoin network, as long as people back-up that belief by the the action of acquiring and holding more. The more greedy people are for Bitcoin, the better are its chances. You should never want people to spend more—you should want everyone to be as greedy as possible.

All Hail the Hoarders
Let out your inner hoarder. Don’t deny your urges. Let him out and come to terms with him. Imagine how he would look if he could sit on your hoard of bitcoins. Doesn’t he look terribly happy? Let him roll in your bitcoins. Doesn’t he look so cute poring over his copy of Atlas Shrugged? Look at how gleeful he is as he buries it in his basement. Now let his avariciousness flow over you. Let it seep under your skin. Let your hands clutch! Let you teeth clench and your mouth contort into a covetous grimace. I want to hear cackles!

Now didn’t that feel good? The Bitcoin economy will thank you in the end!

I conclude with one proviso: it can be very effective to give out small amounts of bitcoins just to help accustom people to having them. However, the reason this is effective is that it helps spread avarice around.",1523882086,16/04/2018 12:34:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cn6ag/im_hoarding_bitcoins_and_no_you_cant_have_any/,3

"Do not underestimate the ability of global markets to ""Price in"" future expectations","Markets (especially global markets) have a tendency to ""price-in"" future events before they materialize.

In the case of bitcoin, the value per coin that represents global adoption will be priced in years before we actually reach full adoption.

This is also how we will reach a level of stability in price before the masses start using it.

For example, if global adoption is expected (majority consensus) to be fulfilled by 2025, then the price of bitcoin will most likely reach that level of valuation by 2022. After 2022 stability in the price will be sustained for 3 years and become considered solid by the general public, enough that they can trust it to maintain value and provide stability.

My point being that anyone saying bitcoin cant be worth x$ because the amount of usage doesnt warrant that price yet. Do not underestimate the ability of global markets to ""price in"" future expectations.",1523892587,16/04/2018 15:29:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8codel/do_not_underestimate_the_ability_of_global/,1

Samourai Wallet doesn't work with BitPay stores because the author has personal issues with the new QR code standard.,"I was trying to pay the bill for a NameCheap domain with bitcoins, but I couldn't get my phone's wallet to work.  It turns out it's because the author of the Samourai Wallet has [personal issues](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/169222582782/bitpay-qr-codes-are-no-longer-valid-important) with the people who proposed the new QR standard that BitPay uses (personal issues which have nothing to do with the technical merits of the standard, although he throws in some vague FUD about that too which doesn't really even make sense).

This behavior by the author of the Samourai Wallet encapsulates everything that is harmful about the divisive and personal politics that too often cause harm to the cryptocurrency community and our chances for wider mass adoption.  Most users who just want to use bitcoin aren't going to want to get dragged into some developer's personal beefs, they just want to see that Bitcoin works and is easy to use to pay for stuff.  

So I'm dropping Samourai.  What's a better Android wallet alternative (preferably one that supports SegWit)?",1523894669,16/04/2018 16:04:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8con0z/samourai_wallet_doesnt_work_with_bitpay_stores/,0

in advance: PLEASE no BCH Bashing.

Seller threatening to get my bank account closed on localbitcoins,"This seller is threatening depositing £5 into my bank account with the reference BITCOIN in order to close my bank account and affect my credit score. 

I have attached screenshots of their messages which were sent on localbitcoins. 

 They are threatening this if I do not change my feedback. And have also unfairly left me negative feedback. I feel that the feedback I left was Fair, they took hours to respond to the sale, then incorrectly marked it as payment made and sent a false statement saying that that my bank does not take payments on Sunday and they would send the payment the next day (This is incorrect, I made a subsequent sale that was received instantly). I therefore requested them to cancel the trade and left feedback accordingly. 

What do you recommend I do, I have reported them to localbitcoins but should I give in and follow their demands?

How to legally separate sibling's coins into their names from mine?,"In mid-2017 my siblings and I wanted to invest $50k into crypto through coinbase, which we did. Problem is we did it in a rush and only through my Coinbase/Gdax account since it was the account with the highest buying limit, because it was the oldest account. When they opened accounts it wouldn't let them buy any decent amount at once, a couple hundred each time, while mine had a several thousand limit (I bought some coins in 2015, plus fiddled in trading a bit in early 2017, so my limit was higher)

My question is, we want to seperate into our own Trezor wallets, but the record for buying these coins is all in my name legally. How do we legally change them to their names without resetting the Capital gains long term short term clock? Is it possible?

I'm afraid the only option may be for me to just sell their portion, and transfer the money to their coinbase accounts, for them to rebuy it in their names. But that would leave them having to wait another year for the capital gains long term rate to kick in if they sell. 

Is this the only sensible option?

I need this to work so bitcoin.tax correctly calculates my taxes each year. Which is why I'm concerned this may be the only option.",1523916909,16/04/2018 22:15:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8crjrc/how_to_legally_separate_siblings_coins_into_their/,1
Using gdax in unsupported country and tax,"Hi all! I registered on gdax from the USA but was wondering if I would be able to trade in Russia and withdraw funds while physically located there. I emailed gdax customer service and this is what they replied:

“Unfortunately Russia is not yet a GDAX-supported country. Users from Coinbase buy/sell-supported countries are currently able to access GDAX (https://www.coinbase.com/global). We keep this list up to date if you’d like to check back in the future as we’re always working hard to expand into new countries.

If you were to attempt to log into your GDAX account from an unsupported country such as Russia, your account would be temporary locked until you were able to verify that you were back in one of the supported countries.

We can only support countries where we have met the necessary regulations to operate. We are working hard to add support for more countries but we don’t have an estimated time for when new countries may be added.

Please keep in mind you can still use your Coinbase account as a hosted digital currency wallet to receive, store, and send funds.”

I’m wondering if I use VPN could I still trade on gdax from Russia without a problem? May be someone has experience in trading on gdax while being in one of the unsupported country? Also if I live in Russia do I still have to pay tax to an American government if I use gdax? I believe they would report any gains to the IRS.

Beginner trying to use bitcoin plz help,"Hey everyone, I am super new to bitcoin and to be honest am not sure what I'm doing.

So now I have sent the money to the address, but the wallet is trying to sync (and its taking forever which apparently is normal) and I'm not even sure my computer has enough space for it all. I read that I should try to transfer it over to Electrum, so I have that downloaded. I tried doing the Sweep Keys thing, but every time I try it, it says ""no inputs found (note that input needs to be confirmed)""

How cool it would be...,"... if Satoshi waited until mass adoption and then distributed his/hers/theirs bitcoins to the poor? I actually haven't thought about how to identify ALL 'the poor people', but clear demographics that live on very bad conditions exist today, so at least they (actually a very big % of the global population) could certainly get a piece. 

I think it would be very beautiful and the most moving culmination for bitcoin's history. 

I have read (haven't really made much digging about it) that Satoshi could own 1 mil BTC. Thats 4% of the total number of bitcoins to ever be mined, so perhaps it won't make THAT much of a difference, but it still would help a lot of people. Perhaps even some/most of the bitcoin whales start sharing their fortunes too...

But we never buy 1 bitcoin and sell 1 bitcoin its 

.1197 bitcoin bought here, sold .023 bitcoin there, and the market was way over there at that point, so what the hell am I supposed to do for a tax form thats built for old style investments? Do I just aggregate them all on the original date and then the date I sold them?

What is a good way to store a lot of bitcoin,"If someone had $300,000 or more of bitcoin and other coins, what would be a good way to store it. Hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger are not an option due to geography. 

If one lived in a 3rd world country, storing coins only offline would be risky due to the risk of being raided by corrupt governments and police and being permanently separated from the wallets.. 

One option  is z-zip encrypted dropbox + google drive+ other accounts . This means I will never be separated  from my coins if I know the password to the encryption, but the downside is having toot keep coins online.

Call for Presentations: CHAIN-IN'18 Blockchain Conference,"CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

******************************************************************************
Chain-in: The International Industrial &amp; Academic Conference on Blockchain Technology
Porto, Portugal — July 9th &amp; 10th, 2018
http://www.chain-in.org/
******************************************************************************
WHY CHAIN-IN?
- It brings both industrial enthusiasts and academics to interact and join forces for a brighter blockchain future.
- It spans a wide spectrum of talks: technical, law, market, economics, etc., that helps attendees and speakers understand the entire blockchains ecosystem.
- It is a platform for easy/fast/recorded dissemination and speaker's exposure without the burden of academic papers.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Chain-in is a unique industrial and academic conference focused on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency technologies. In spite of all the hype behind the technology, the industry and academia are often following different approaches to build tamper-proof distributed ledgers (or databases). Experience shows that there is no pure black and white, and thus it is wise to have both rivals exchange knowledge and join forces. Chain-in aims at bringing researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from academia and industry to sit together on the same table and try converge to the best of the technology.


PRESENTATION MODEL
Given that blockchains hail from industry, Chain-in avoids the academic proceeding-based style, and rather adopts a more ""casual"" model through dedicating the event to presentations and interaction. This is also a great exposure opportunity for enthusiasts, developers, and non-experts to speak at Chain-in. The ultimate goal, and the hope, is to foster interaction and enrich the discussions


TOPICS OF INTEREST
Chain-in gives the opportunity to any interesting talk related to blockchains or cryptocurrencies as long as it serves the above goals. In particular, the subjects covered include—but are not limited to:

- Blockchain Architectures
- Blockchain Protocols (novel or not)
- Blockchain consensus
- Proof of ""Something"" methods
- Byzantine Fault Consensus Protocols
- Byzantine-based distributed ledgers
- Private, Federated, and Public Blockchains
- Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins, and Altcoins

Why do people root for the collapse of our financial system?,"I see this on other places too, but I find it alarming that so many people around crypto genuinely want to see the world burn. A classic example is when people predict (and root for) the collapse of our current financial system. I suppose they look forward to this event as the only opportunity to get rid of greedy bankers and corrupt politicians. However, do they ever stop to consider the catastrophic consequences this would have on the majority of regular citizens? In 2008, it was not bankers or politicians who paid for the crisis. It was normal people, like you and me, who lost everything they had. Why would anyone wish for this to happen again on a much larger scale?

Let me tell you something: if you bought crypto, you are greedy. Like everyone else you want it to appreciate in value and make a profit, and there's nothing wrong with that. Just don't pretend you have a moral high ground because crypto ""is going to change the world"". Besides, what is it exactly that you wish to see changed? Despite the news telling us every day how fucked everything is everywhere, humanity has never been in a better place. These are the most peaceful times in history, and the amount of people that have been lifted out of poverty in the last two decades is absolutely unprecedented. So we must be doing something right.

I hold crypto and want to see it thrive. For my own benefit, obviously, but also hoping that it will have a positive impact in the advancement of technologies that make the world a better place. However, I don't want this to happen at the expense of everyone else. If the US dollar collapses and only those of us holding crypto make it, I would be very sad to see all my family and friends lose everything they have.

Stop the resentment. This is not a war agains banks and governments, and if we keep pretending it is there is no doubt we are going to lose it.",1523930628,17/04/2018 02:03:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ct2cn/why_do_people_root_for_the_collapse_of_our/,4

If you had a time machine,"I remember when a friend told me about BTC back in 2009 and I told him that was bs and its price would never raise to the point that it would be really profitable to invest in such a thing. Today its worth 8k USD and I keep checking the price everyday regretting being the lazy bastard that I am and wishing I had a time machine.

This is purely hypothetical but lets imagine you had a time machine that would only allow you to travel to the past. What would you do exactly? Which time would you pick to travel to and why? Would you buy BTC online or mine it? Perhaps both? And if so which hardware would you use? Also how many BTC would be too much to own?

Would it be profitable to invest to the point you would have say 1 million BTC or would you just get a few thousands and why? How many BTC would sell and how would you sell it? Also what kind of impact do you think it would cause to the market if you sold when the price reached 17k/BTC? I imagine that owning a million BTC by your own would perhaps lead to a future where the price would never reach such values, or would it?",1523932787,17/04/2018 02:39:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cta6k/if_you_had_a_time_machine/,1

"Why Tether is worth nothing even with a 1:1 backing (not FUD, just my thoughts)","I really do not understand how people don't notice this; even if Tether was backed 1:1 by USD it's worth NOTHING. Please read.

Imagine I take 1000 pieces of paper and write USDT on them with a pen. I then tell people to buy these for 1 USD each so that they can use them as a ""currency"" in my electro house music festival to buy drinks. There are only 5 people selling drinks so, as there are a lot of paper USDT's, prices of these drinks rise and rise due to the high demand.

People in the festival buy these papers from other mates for USD, since everyone thinks and believes that these pieces of paper are worth what they were bought for. However, I NEVER said I would change these papers back for USD! I'm keeping the USD I collected for me :D

What does this mean? It means that all those papers are worth nothing since, even though they are backed by the USD in my pocket, I won't accept those pieces of crap again and, once the festival is over, people will find that they can't buy a single thing with them. I will then use the USD I got from selling pieces of paper to buy a private plane and a Ford Fiesta to match it. This is the definition of a scam.

What makes an asset valuable is the fact that it can be traded, and the truth is that Tether's market cap is never going down. Tether trading inside Kraken cannot mask the fact that not a single Tether has actually been destroyed / redeemed for true USD fiat and never will. I hope this whole explanation was clear enough.

So what’s the reason of the rise? Some people guessed that the massive order was paid by a tycoon in the circle of bitcoin, or some large institution. However, it is sure that someone or institution is interested in bitcoin.


The rise of bitcoin was over 1000% last year. According to the data from [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/), as the recover of bitcoin, the position of short sale is reducing. There is no doubt that numerous positions are settling liquidation, because bitcoin price is going up dramatically.

Solving the issue of private keys,"Hey guys,

first at all, sorry for any mistakes that will be made due my lack of English knowledge. Nevertheless, I have a question and hopefully you will be able to answer it.

I guess that the whole crypto cummunity widely agrees on the statement that the success of crypto currencies highly depend on its usecase. First of all, we need crypto currencies in the circulation of our every day life. That means we have to reach a point where we will use crypto currencies for our every day money transactions (e.g. buying a coffee, a snack, clothes ect.).

That being said, we need a method which facilitate the use of crypto currenies as a means of payment. While smaller transactions can be done by so called store-value cards (prepaid cards), those SVCs have relatively low limits. This is due to the fact that the risk of loss or theft is quite high for devices like SVCs.

Same is true for a digital wallet and its private key. In that regard the question occurs which method will be used to store and transfer larger amounts of money in form of crypto currencies? Is there a solution which wont be on the expenses of dezentralization and anonymity? I would be really interested if you already know any solutions to that problem.

So I really want to use breadwallet to carry my bitcoin... but i have a few concerns.,"I'm on iOS. My question is:

How do I know that the open source code that they have published, is the same code that they upload to apples's servers? Meaning, isn't it possible that a bad actor working at BreadApp, could add a bit of code to the update to send all private keys to his private server? What could stop him? Would Bread notice? Would Apple?

I *love* the idea of using a 'hardware' wallet on my phone, but I don't understand why everyone is so comfortable using a closed source solution like Apple for something so important.

Browser tool to ease Bitcoin multisig usage,"IMHO multisig is not used as often as it should be.
I guess it is due to two major reasons:

1. The person sending coins does not actually benefit from the decreased risk compared to traditional escrow.
2. Sending coins to an escrow address is much simpler than getting the required Bitcoin public key.

I decided to create a simple browser based JavaScript tool similar to bitaddress.org with focus on multisig.

* No software installation
* No blockchain download
* No Internet connection
* Completely implemented in JavaScript and based on well known libs.
* The source code is available on GitHub.

Features: 

* Bitcoin Bech32 / SegWit conversion
* Bitcoin 2/3 Multisig
* Random wallet and brain wallet generation 
* Redeem script recovery if only pubkeys and address are known

I will continue to add more features. Feel free to send me your requests!



Please note that the Multisig tools are intended for the person sending the coins to generate required keys and verify the resulting address. 
You can enter all required information together with the resulting address and it will recreate and verify the address.

* Site URL: https://www.cryptocurrencytools.org/ 
* GitHub: https://github.com/cryptocurrencytoolsdotorg/cryptocurrencytools.org


This is how the Bitcoin 2/3 Multisig tool works:

tl;dr: Goto https://www.cryptocurrencytools.org/ select Bitcoin, then Multisig, then click ""Demo"".

Note: You can check out this tool online but if you intend to really use it you should download a copy and run it locally.

* Goto https://www.cryptocurrencytools.org/ select Bitcoin and then Multisig.
* Click Next to generate a new Bitcoin private key.
* Send the Bitcoin public key to your partners and wait for theirs.
* Safe the Bitcoin private key in a secure place. You will need it later to continue.

When you have both Bitcoin public keys from your partners go back to the service.

* Paste your previously generated private key and the two public keys from your partners.
* If you also have the MS address paste it also.
* Click Next to generate the MS addresses and redeem scripts and check the provided MS address.

New use for bitcoin bounties - find the best professionals for gigs,"Just saw this on Product Hunt, and thought it was interesting. I often use gig platforms like upwork to hire developers, and it is nearly impossible to separate legit good professionals from those that just look good but won't deliver. 

Coinvet is a cool concept, using bitcoin bounties to recommenders to help you find the best professionals. This looks like a good practical use of crypto and blockchain that's available right now.

Is bitcoin transaction fees fair.?,"Everyone wanted higher bitcoin price and we achieved this but another problem become transaction fees. When bitcoin's price was low, we had to pay also low fee and now when it rised, we have to pay high fee in bitcoins and plus that high fee is more higher with current price. Is this fair? The higher the price, the more money miners have with bitcoin exchange.
To my mind when price becomes high, we have to pay low fee and when it becomes low, than fee has to be high. To my mind it had to be done like this from the begining.",1523977176,17/04/2018 14:59:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cx5yk/is_bitcoin_transaction_fees_fair/,1

Have been scammed?,"I just came over from the 'Investor Games' subforum (hope I got that right). A guy there said he came across a site asking to double his bitcoin, he paid in $20 and got $40 the following day or so. He then went for a higher plan of $300 hoping to cash out $600 but they asked him to pay in another $300 before cashing out. He got confused and was asking for advice. 

I think I've been there before. Before I became a forum member. I once came across one of those scam sites promising to generate bitcoins. Thought it was real, but when they asked me to pay some transaction fee, I was stuck. I had no money to pay the fee. With the benefit of hindsight, I know I'd have sent them the 'transaction fee' had I had the coins to send them.

Now, what have been your experience with internet scams?

BitBrighton event 28th April,"We have confirmed the schedule for the next BitBrighton conference and workshop tickets will be £4 each and limited to 25 per session.

There will be four Bitcoin workshops throughout the day, two will be Bitcoin basics and two will be Bitcoin storage and security classes. These will be run by Matthew Baldock from Portsmouth Crypto.

We will also have a short presentation and Q&amp;A from Fiona Cooper on 'The Problem with Money', here's some more info on Fiona's background;

""Fiona Cooper is a passionate advocate of blockchain technology. She got interested early on, spurred on by her strong belief that centralised money is badly broken. Like most of us, she wishes she'd put her money where her mouth is earlier and bought into crypto back in 2010 when she first knew about it! Fiona runs Brighton Crypto Women and is a public speaker and communications professional, she spoke at the London Crypto Investor Show in March 2018."" 

We will also be hosting the Bitcoin cinema showing three films throughout the day for free, tickets available now at the links below:",1523988520,17/04/2018 18:08:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cyntb/bitbrighton_event_28th_april/,1

A few questions regarding trading,"Hi, can someone explain what happens to the price when people open longs vs shorts? I've heard that if enough longs are opened then we are prone to go down. Is this always the case?

Also, how does leverage trading really work? If I trade on Bitmex.. who gets all the money when I get liquidated? Do Bitmex get it or someone else?

And for example, what happens when people get a large amount of shorts liquidated? Is that a bearish sign?

Real noob questions I know, but it's stuff that I've always been wondering about but can't find the answers anywhere",1523989544,17/04/2018 18:25:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cysno/a_few_questions_regarding_trading/,1

"Not sure if this is the right sub to post, but I have some questions about the blockchain technology.","My understanding is that full nodes are the central participants that allow for the consensus network to function.  The way to ensure the integrity of the system is when there are enough full nodes on the system to all agree to the transactions on the ledger.  New transactions are broadcasted to all nodes and are accepted when a quorum of nodes agree that it is valid.  It is possible, based on the timing that two transaction reach different nodes, that double-spend transactions would both be accepted by a quorum of nodes.  The transactions are then all placed in a block.  Miner compete to be the first to find a hash to “validate” a block.  That just means that this miner is the first to broadcast the time-stamped block to the rest of the network.  The full nodes then check all of the transactions in the block to decide whether or not to accept the block.   For example, if the nodes detect 2 transactions in the same block both attempting to send the same input to different addresses, the nodes will reject the block and transactions.  The blocks that are accepted become a part of the chain that subsequent blocks are built on.
Is this generally correct?  Also, if the nodes reject a block with conflicting transactions, is the whole block rejected or just those transactions?  And does the miner still receive his reward if the block is rejected by the nodes?",1523993046,17/04/2018 19:24:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cz9hi/not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_sub_to_post_but_i/,0

So we can put an end to those shenanigan but the whole crypto need to get behind the Bitcoin Foundation so they can help with the lawsuit to defeat the Bitlicense.            
                
In 2015, I started a lawsuit on my own after all the bitcoins lawyers laughed me out as being ridiculous and ignorant. They were advising me to play along with the politicians.
            
**The reason I know that?** Because I am part of the same political circles as those people and I know them pretty well *(even if they don't know me.)*             
              
I have been fighting for more than 30 years over the building where I live and I learned how to be shrewd like them.

New York Attorney General Requesting Info from Binance (and 12 other exchanges),"AS was originally reported by WSJ and bizjournals: https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2018/04/17/new-york-ag-puts-cryptocurrency-firms-on-notice.html

Schneiderman’s office sent a letter and questionnaire to companies including New York-based Gemini Trust Co. and itBit Trust Co., as well as Bitstamp USA Inc., Payward Inc., Bittrex Inc., Circle Internet Financial Ltd., **Binance Ltd**., Elite Way Developments LLP, Gate Technology Inc., and Huobi Global Ltd.

The important reason why I am highlighting Binance (and to some lesser extend Huobi) is that Binance is a very large foreign company being probed by US regulators because they have US customers -- in fact Binance's own figures report that 33%+ of their users are US based customers so the NY AG fully believes they have regulatory powers over Binance. You can look at all the full questionaire here: https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/virtual_markets_integrity_initiative_questionnaire.pdf

Binance infographic of user distribution: https://imgur.com/a/rhhkp
Last Binance blog post revealing user distribution: https://medium.com/@binance/binance-weekly-report-e16a42c757d2

Why this is important is because it most likely will end up with Binance banning US customers just as all offshore exchanges in the past that received US regulator notices followed closely by the termination/banning of US customers from using their platforms. Before I get a bunch of angry uneducated responses this isn't mean to be FUD-inducing with a market reaction -- plenty of platforms including OKEX, BFX, BitMEX all banned US customers with little to no impact on the overall markets. Be aware that US customers are a massive and expensive regulatory burden on offshore exchanges so much so that most will chose not to do business with US persons.",1524011871,18/04/2018 00:37:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8d1k81/new_york_attorney_general_requesting_info_from/,2
Samourai Wallet Transactions/Funds Disappeared,"Hey guys, so a few days ago I installed Samourai wallet because I wanted to try it out and I send over some bitcoin and everything was fine. Today I go to try the stealth feature and when I open the app I noticed that my bitcoin and my transactions were no longer appearing. I reinstalled it and put in my recovery phrase and still nothing. I check blockchain explorer to see if my funds were sent to another address but the wallet address still shows that my funds are in the wallet.

Anybody have any advice? Maybe the app is just glitching, I know samourai had a problem like this in the past.

Verification Only Based Forum Concept,"Dear Reddit,

I am a student, and have been a crypto enthusiast for a while. While reddit always has a place in my heart, I was wondering about creating an online forum that is verification/invite only, to allow for more experienced users to engage in only serious conversation.

Almost every single crypto forum is plagued with false information, spammers, and downright manipulation. By creating some sort of verification system (maybe send your bitcoin amount proof, or your previous history, or something) would allow for a much cleaner forum.

As a student with depleted funds, I'd love to do this project in my free time, as this is something that I've always wanted to see.

How to visualize mass adoption?,"If we currently converted the world GDP to bitcoin and had a 1 world currency, bitcoin would be worth approximately $550,000 per coin.

How would bitcoin be worth $550,000 though if USD would no longer exist? 

Would the world gdp prior to btc taking over the world create the value of bitcoin? 

Would we drive through McDonalds and the drive through price would show the “dollar” menu as 0.00000182 btc? Is this how are value would be derived? That many decimal points for so many everyday transactions that happen all the time seems super confusing af. 

How would you shop around for bargains when getting groceries? How do you not confuse coupons? (Save 0.000001 btc with the purchase of 0.00000182 worth of goods.) seems confusing huh?

Unless I’m missing something, everything sure seems like it’ll be confusing. Confusing in the sense that we’re likely talking 100+ years before mass adoption. Am I crazy?

School curriculum will need to be changed with a heavy emphasis on reading decimal places easily. 

Maybe someone could create code that would auto correct bitcoin decimals to USD. Like 0.00000182 ($1) until people got completely used to valuing everything in btc.


Someone please set me straight. I’m a loose thinking cannon tonight.",1524019924,18/04/2018 02:52:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8d2f18/how_to_visualize_mass_adoption/,1

The deadline of tax payment in America is coming. Will the bull market appear again?,"Recently, the reason why bitcoin declines is that the deadline of tax payment in America is coming, so some traders would like to close a position. After [btc price](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price/) rose by 20% last week, many experts think the mid-term adjustment of [bicoins](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/) have finished. A lot of digital currency owners have to pay their taxes by statutory currency because the deadline of tax payment is near. 



Tom Lee, the executive partner of Fundstrat Global Advisors, is the first one realizing the reason. He believes that [bitcoin value](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/) will achieve $25000 in the end of 2018. Although Lee is optimistic about bitcoin, he pointed out that the rise of cryptocurrency cannot only depend on tax exemption.



Besides, Coinbase announced to purchase Earn.com officially. Coinbase claimed that Balaji Srinivasan, the CEO of Earn.com will join in Coinbase as CTO. According to the report of FX678, Earn.com is the hardware producer of bitcoin established in 2013. Then it began to focus on social network and the users can obtain crptocurrency by answering questions or finishing tasks.

Australia - Crypto Tax Planning,"The below is not tax advice, it is purely my interpretation of the law.

As it currently stands according to the ATO, ""Where you exchange one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency, you dispose of one CGT asset and acquire another CGT asset.""

This practice has led to a few stories about the following situation

'Person A' buys 'Crypto A' for $100

'Crypto A' increases from $100 to $1000

'Person A' Trades 'Crypto A' for 'Crypto B' at a rate of 1:1

*'Financial year 1' ends*

'Crypto A' &amp; 'Crypto B' decrease from $1000 to $200

'Person A' Sells 'Crypto B' for $200

'Person A' completes a tax return for 'financial year 1'

'Person A' gets audited for not reporting disposal of CGT asset

'Person A''s amended assessment includes income for $900 capital gain

'Person A' has to pay tax marginal tax rate (for example use 32.5%) on $900 Gain

'Person A' has to pay $292.5 tax on $900 Gain

'Person A' only has $200 from the sale of 'Crypto B'

*Financial year 2 ends* 

'Person A' is entitled to claim a capital loss of $800

Capital Losses are only able to be deducted against capital gains
 
$800 capital loss is carried forward to later capital gains


As ridiculous as the above situation seems, that is the way that the letter of the law currently reads, and I heavily encourage anyone who hasn't already to voice their frustrations here. (before 20/04/2018)
https://lets-talk.ato.gov.au/PAG/news_feed/consultation-substantiating-cryptocurrency-taxation-events

In the meantime, what can you do if you have traded at the peak?

A possible solution is to re-trade at current level prices BEFORE the financial year ends.
this way you are able to use the capital loss to offset the capital gain made during the financial year.

There is a term called ""wash sale"" which in relation to the ASX is selling any shares you currently have a capital loss for and buying back the next day to incur the capital loss which can be used to offset any capital gains you have. 

There is a tax ruling on this matter here: http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?DocID=TPA/TA20087/NAT/ATO/00001

Basically, a summary is that a 'wash sale' is caught in the anti-avoidance rules and therefore any relevant capital loss is disregarded. The main reason behind this is because you have re-acquired the exact same (or similar) CGT asset.

So why would it be different for Crypto?

A: If you refer back to the very first line of this post, ""Where you exchange one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency, you dispose of one CGT asset and acquire another CGT asset."" 

Since the two separate crypto's are seen to be separate CGT assets, a 'wash sale' would not be applicable. In the eyes of the ATO, It would be like trading your BHP shares for Telstra shares, completely different assets.

A few final points

1. The above is not tax advice.
2. If you are unaware, in Australia there is a 50% discount for holding CGT assets for longer than 1 year
3. I am happy to discuss further if anyone wants",1524048450,18/04/2018 10:47:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8d4ov0/australia_crypto_tax_planning/,1

"If you truly want to Understand the Lightning Network, I've just recently published 4 podcast episodes breaking it down and answering all the common FUD...","I used to be really active on this subreddit but haven't been in quite a while. I have since started a podcast reading audio versions of all the best Bitcoin articles in the space.  I can always consume content at about 100x the rate in audio form than in written form.  I started the podcast assuming I am probably not the only who would've benefitted greatly from something like that being available.  With that, I have ventured back to r/bitcoin recently and seen questions and concerns about Lightning network that show how unfamiliar many still are with it. 

The last 4 episodes of my podcast have all been dedicated to painting a picture of the system that makes the Lightning Network both secure and a significant innovation to crypto.  The first 3 break it down at a technical level by reading, summarizing, and commentating on Aaron van Wirdum's (from BitcoinMagazine) excellent explanatory series that was one of my first introductions to it a few years back.  Then the 4th episode is a final summary (repetition is the only way to really get the whole picture) and then I answer a lot of the common complaints and FUD around it that can be easily addressed from a clear technical perspective.

I have done this specifically for new people who want to learn, so I hope somebody can get something out of it.  I have a few friends that have listened to it multiple times trying to get a better understanding (which might be needed).  With that, I'll provide the links and feel free to share it with anyone you think will be interested or who believes something about Lightning that just isn't remotely true.  Hopefully this can shed some light.

Imo Bitcoin is still too complicated for your avarage Joe. When will this change?,"I'm a Swedish 27 y/o guy who's been keeping an eye on bitcoin for several years. I first heard of it from my brother when it was only worth a few dollars and he told me to start mining some. (I didn't and boy do I regret that..)

I've been interested in buying a few times during these years, but never really understood how to get hold of some. It seemed too complicated and I never really tried to be honest, but the last two years that changed.

2016 I started googling and found out you needed a wallet etc. There were so many wallets to choose from that I wasn't sure which ones to trust and I was intimidated. I ended up giving up (again, big regret...).

Beginning of 2017 I thought to myself that it was now or never. This time I actually got as far as getting myself a wallet. The next step was to acquire some coins to put in it. The easiest way after some googling seemed like buying from an exchange. Here is where I ran into a wall this time. To get approved (or whatever is it called) I had to send them pictures of my ID and some recent bills. I was living with my parents at the moment and the bills were in their name, so again I gave up (Regret regret regret).

 Yes, I am very lazy and give up as soon as I run into a tiny bump on the road.. BUT I am a relatively young guy. I have used conputers, played videogames and bought new technology my entire life. If I couldn't figure out how to buy and own bitcoin, how is my mom or dad going to?

I think that when it's as easy to buy bitcoin as it is to buy in-game currency in videogames, then we will really see new money flow in.

Sorry for the wall of text and grammar. Just a Swedish guy that needed to vent. I'm cross-posting this in a few places because it took me a really long time to write and I want it to be seen, hehe.

PS. I ended up buying into an ETF in Sweden that follows the price of bitcoin and one that follows ethereum. In december 2017.....

TL:DR Young guy that's used to new technology thought it was too complicated to buy bitcoin in 2016 and beginning of 2017. Bought in december 2017 instead...",1524061876,18/04/2018 14:31:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8d61nx/imo_bitcoin_is_still_too_complicated_for_your/,1

Is bitcoin a scam or the future? What are the criteria we can use to decide?,"What are the dimensions along which bitcoin, or its competitors, should be evaluated?

Like if I want to know how good a coin is along the SCAM (bad) to FUTURE (good) spectrum what should we be looking at?

Some ideas:

**Level of Decentralization** - how to measure?

* number and share of mining pools
* number of nodes

Crypto Tab- bitcoin mining on chrome. Interesting concept. Will this slow down my computer?,[removed],1524068086,18/04/2018 16:14:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8d6v0x/crypto_tab_bitcoin_mining_on_chrome_interesting/,1
Governmental tax is equivalent to taking small bites out of our portfolio?,"Cryptocurrencies (and trading thereof) are not taxed in my home country - so my knowledge on the way governments are taxing their citizens is very limited. Hopefully this post will allow other people in the crypto community with little or no knowledge relating to tax to understand things better.

-

Let's pretend / assume the following:

* Someone owns 100 BTCs, and just leaves them there sitting in a hardware wallet. No trades whatsoever: no buys, no sells
* The price of 1 BTC is at $10,000, and doubles by the next year's tax settlement
* Governmental Tax on cryptos is 1%
* Savings in fiat is very low

If I'm sitting on 100 BTCs, and after 1 year the value of BTC doubles (from $10,000 to $20,000), then I made a profit of $1,000,000 ($10,000 x 100 BTCs). As far as I understand, some governments see this as a source of taxable income. If so, I now owe the government 1% (assumed rate) of my profits ($1,000,000) = $10,000. 

If I don't have the fiat to pay my debts, I need to sell stuff - one of my options being BTC itself. To pay off my $10,000 debt, I need to sell 0.5 BTCs at the new market price. This means that after hodling 100 BTCs for a year, the government 'took' 0.5 BTCs from me (in fiat - but the government themselves can use money obtained through taxing cryptos to purchase cryptos themselves, taking it away from their citizens and giving it to themselves, leading to centralization of ownership).

I'm pretty sure the math is right - but my understanding of how governments are starting to tax cryptocurrencies probably (and hopefully) isn't. Please tell me that the situation is better?",1524068532,18/04/2018 16:22:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8d6x2q/governmental_tax_is_equivalent_to_taking_small/,0

"I am a Cryptocurrency Dealer, AMA","Hey Reddit!

I'm a cryptocurrency dealer here in Los Angeles. I know it may sound strange, but I work in a specialized industry helping folks who want to buy cryptocurrencies inside of a retirement plan (like an IRA or 401k)....pretty much my job is talking about crypto all day every day with people ranging from “average joe” types up to multi-millionaire  investors, and needless to say....it’s a lot of fun!....So ask me anything!

My Background: I've been in the finance industry for a few years working at one of the top precious metals investment firms in the country. As more of our clients started to ask about crypto, the company decided to launch this new division and of course I jumped on the opportunity. I am very excited to be a part of it, especially because my company is able to offer the MOST competitive service out there simply due to our business structure. I personally love crypto (it is a huge topic in my social-circle), and getting to combine my passion with my career is a blessing. Being that Bitcoin and crypto is so new and not a lot of people know what it is, I feel a personal responsibility to be as informative and as helpful as possible so that my clients can make the best decision for themselves. I do not recommend anyone buy into any investment if they do not fully understand it.

That being said, I am confident that I know my industry inside and out, and am here to help. Ask me anything!

Bitcoin on Research,"Regards /r/Bitcoin!

You might've heard of our mission research and educational organization. It's a debilitating illness usually affecting people who are already victims, like sexual assault survivors who still suffer and are tormented every day since. Not only do they experience traumatic flashbacks, even sleep is no relief thanks to serious nightmares. It is life threatening.

If the test is successful, it can be approved already this year. Charitable Foundation Winston Churchill created a corporation with public benefits, wholly owned by our non-profit organization, which will sell psychedelics after approval. It is a scalable and financially stable structure that can initiate a renaissance in the research of therapeutic applications of many psychedelics.

Let's make medicine a reality and give the gift of a pleasant life to those who suffer from diseases. If you think that psychedelic drugs can have incredible therapeutic potential, then I think that today it is one of the most successful projects.

And let's do it with cryptocurrency.
We are also open to communication with all who may be interested.

Poloniex is the worst exchange ever. Stay Away! Take my loss and frustration as a lesson so you don't have to go through the same.,"Over 3 months i've been waiting for a stellar withdrawal that shows as 'complete:error'. Finally when they got to my ticket, they closed it, without any resolution, and still no sign of my stellar in my Poloniex wallet, or the wallet I sent it to. So finally after waiting 3 months they just close my ticket without even bothering to reply to me? What kind of a sick joke is this?!!!!

Take this as a warning! A joke of an exchange. Don't let losing money be the way you have to learn. Take the lesson from me and learn from my mistake. STAY AWAY FROM POLONIEX!

UPDATE: They keep closing my ticket. They closed my old ticket, so I opened a new one and again they just close without resolving?! What the hell is wrong with Poloniex?! Now everytime someone asks me about what exchange to use, I will most certainly say 'whatever you do, DO NOT use Poloniex'!

On the other hand, crypto is more directly correlated to opinion of holders, and so fluctuates more easily.

How can you securely save a seed for the long term? Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme?,"So my basic idea is this: I want to make sure that if something happens to me my family will be able to gain access to my portfolio. Pretty common.

The issue is, I don't feel comfortable just saving a piece of paper with a mnemonic written on it.

1, what if it gets lost or destroyed? Well, the solution is to put it in a safe place and use something like a cryptosteel or coldti (cryptosteel's younger, less fashionable and cheaper cousin).

Second, what if someone sees/takes it? This is a biggie. Right now, the recommendation seems to be ""put it in a safe, private place"". The thing is, if this is a long term storage solution (like if it's a college fund for a kid or a rainy day fund meant to last years and years) it could always be found, either accidentally (contractors, cleaners, kids) or intentionally (snooping, either for shits and giggles or specifically to find the seed).

So my thought is, encrypt, right? I need a safe way to store 24 words, encrypted, engraved or stamped into a corrosion-resistant metal. The one last requirement is that it should be easy to access for the people who are supposed to access it. This is a biggie. I can't necessarily assume that I'll be around to help decipher the seed.

I've been looking into Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (which is a kind of threshold cryptography, I believe). The idea is, you take your secret (in our case, the seed) and it's split into (for example) 5 ""shares"". Only 3 of the shares are needed to reconstruct the seed. This way I could pass the shares out to family members with instructions on how to use them if I pass away. Even if 1 or 2 of the shares were lost the secret would be recoverable, while anyone finding just 1 or 2 of the shares wouldn't be able to reconstruct the seed.

The trouble is, there's no standard implementation of SSSS - it's a method, not a specific software package. That means that I can't rely on any one implementation to still be around in 10 or 15 years.

/u/iancoleman has [an implementation on his site](https://iancoleman.io/shamir39/) that is frankly genius, but as he says on the page it's not standardized and unfortunately looks like it's not under development anymore.

Satoshilabs has [SLIP-0039 on their github](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md), but it's not clear to me what the status of that project is.

Does anyone have any ideas on how a seed could be stored securely (read: encrypted) but with confidence that the method used will still be accessible in 15-20 years? Seems like this is an important issue.",1524096606,19/04/2018 00:10:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dagv3/how_can_you_securely_save_a_seed_for_the_long/,1

Issues with filing taxes,"Did anyone else run into a similar issue?  I used a service Bitcoin Tax (http://bitcoin.tax),  which was extremely helpful. I entered all the opening lots, all the trading activity, etc,  and the tool, after a few hours of processing, produced results.  I then chose a relief method that best suited my situation (LIFO), and exported the data out as a 2017.txf file and also as 8949 PDF file. 

The problem occurred when I tried to import the 2017.txf file into TurboTax Home &amp; Business 2017 edition.  This is the most expensive version of the tax preparation software that I purchased to help with 2017 tax year.

The error that I got was:

We notice you have more than 3,000 financial transactions to import. TurboTax wasn‘t designed to handle this many transactions. We apologize! Please contact us to request a refund (go to www.turbotax.com and select Support).

This happened because I had over 13,000+ trades.    I am now at a loss as to what to do. Because of the timing, I have decided to file for an extension.   I had sent my estimated tax amt to both FED and STATE, which was also problematic, since both had issues on Tuesday, but I finally managed to do it late Tuesday night...

The question is,  what am I supposed to do now?  Some of the material I see online says you are supposed to e-file your tax and then print out and send the 8949 PDF in paper form to the IRS within 3 business days.   For me, this means roughly 1,650 pages of (little) trades.  Is this the only thing that I can do?   Somewhere else, I read that all I need to do is simply to summarize the trades into categories (Short term gain, Long term gain, etc).   

If anyone has any advice on how to move forward I would greatly appreciate it... Since I filed for an extension (never done this before),  I understand I have until Mid-October 2018 to file, but I just want to be done with this and move forward...

Check out our latest piece: Is Bitcoin Decentralized?,,1524121499,19/04/2018 07:04:59,http://cryptoiscoming.com/is-bitcoin-decentralized/,0
Why isn't there a Bitcoin island?,"Many crypto-community members believe that the Isle of Man may soon became a save-heaven for international startups implementing decentralized money solutions.

I beg to differ.

Isle of Man's regulatory policies towards crypto are as odd-shaped as its famous state symbol - ""triskelion"", formed by three bent armored legs. On the one leg-hand, Isle’s official position is demonstratively pro-crypto. As early as July 2014 the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA) had published on its web-site the brief communique peculiarly named ""Virtual currencies – including Bitcoin"", which said ""Recognising this (Bitcoin) trend, the Isle of Man Government has already stated that it welcomes those who can meet the necessary standards ... ."".

Those, who are familiar with a kind of terminology, which has been widely adapted by world's financial bureaucracy to describe the new form of decentralized digital currency, know too well that the verb ""welcome"" isn't part of the usual bank's official vocabulary. No wonder then, that some part of crypto-community had been inspired by a wonderful opportunity to have an ""unsinkable crypto-carrier"" stationed right at the Mediterranean cost of the European continent. Driven by those optimistic expectations several major crypto-companies have already announced that they plan to move their headquarters to the island.

On the other leg-hand, Isle's financial watch-dogs demonstrated some major sings of double-thoughts. In April 2015 IOMFSA changed Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 as to include Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. It may, of course, sound like common-sense to many crypto-enthusiasts. After all, adding KYC and AML routine to their interfaces has already became a routine for almost all leading crypto-exchanges around the world. Equally, the Act's stipulation to have all transactions exceeding 12,000 EURO reported to authority may also be tolerated by crypto-users as an annoying but necessary form of government's intrusion, presumably aimed at preventing major ""evil-doings"".

However, there's also the third leg-hand to this story. IOMFSA also insisted on drastically reducing this limit to 1,000 EURO. That makes a whole policy of Isle ""open-handedness"" towards crypto-currency internally inconsistent. What Isle's bureaucrats are actually hinting is that they now suspect almost every crypto-users to be a crook. In that case island's authorities shouldn't be so engaging right from the start, which might helped many crypto-entrepreneurs to have a second, more realistic look on Isle's ""real politic"" toward new, decentralized digital economy. Providing the current trend of Isle's crypto-policy tightening is kept intact, Isle of Man may soon be converted into Chateau d'If for crypto-holders.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: relatively friendly;
economic climate: relatively friendly;
regions to focus: EU;
industries to focus: FinTech, e-sports, e-games;
major limitations: hardening EU regulatory climate, high costs (including hiring) of running business, increased competition;
stimulus: low corporate income tax, excellent telecommunication infrastructure;
opportunities: to build a FinTech company orientated on EU market.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (moderately negative).

"Lightning Network flaws, thoughts?","I just saw this post https://www.np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8d759v/ln_fud_debunked_podcast_debunked/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=btc, mentioning several flaws of the Lightning Network. Do they have a substance behind them? Here it goes:

Someone announced on \r\bitcoin a podcast that is supposed to debunk the ""FUD about the LN"". well, it is quite disappointing. For the most part it just repeats the hype that has been put out bu Ln believers since the beginning, and does not address the real problems with the idea.

There are many things wrong with that podcast. Here is a brief recap of some of them:

1. The available software (lnd) is not a ""beta version"" but a ""toy implementation"": a version that cannot be used for real payments, because it lacks essential features and does not scale to the target size.
2. The fact is that there are no ""watchers"" (""watchtowers"") means that users are forced to remain online most of the time, downloading and scanning the blockchain. For that reason, the current version of the lnd does not let mobile users create bidirectional channels, because they would be too insecure.
3. If watchers were available, almost every user would have to notify a watcher promptly of almost every LN payment -- and pay a fee for him to keep watching, and trust that he is indeed watching. So much for ""trustless""...4
4. The fact that a node must be online to receive an LN payment is a big problem, especially for mobile users. Note that PayPal, bank wires, and even raw bitcoin do not have this limitation.5
5. The LN will not be usable until most bitcoin users have adopted it. If only half bitcoin users are on the LN, it may actually increase the on-chain traffic, instead of relieving it.
6. Gurus have predicted fees of $50 or more for on-chain transactions. In that case there would be an upfront, non-refundable $100 fee per channel for joining the LN, and another $50 fee for adding more funding to an existing channel.
7. In the current implementation, most channels will be funded only by the party that opened the channel. Then most users would not be able to receive more than what they have already spent through the LN.
8. Even with channels funded in both directions, nodes would have to be balanced on a scale of months. Alice cannot receive a salary of $5000 through the LN, evey month, if she spends only $2000 every month.
10. If Walmart is forbidden to do business with ISIS, they are forbidden to accept, send, or intermediate multi-hop payments that touch ISIS nodes. Thus users who want to be KYC/AML compliant will have to only deal with LN users whose identities they know, or with mediators who can be trusted to be KYC/AML compliants themselves.
11. I hate bankers as much as anyone else, but the author of the podcast doesn't understand at all what banks do, why they are needed, and why they would continue to exist (and create ""doubly virtual"" money) even if the economy switched 100% to bitcoin.
12. The current toy network was created by LN believers for testing, so it cannot be taken as representative of what the real LN would look like if it were to exist. And anyway it has a remarkable feature: one cannot ever know how it is being used, or even if it is being used at all.
13. While LN payments are private, spooks could in theory detect them by pretending to send payments routed through the channel of interest, and noting when those attempts fail due to insufficient balance in that channel.
14. And, most importantly, the podcasts did not even mention the problem of finding a route in the network, without knowing who is online and how much balance remains in each channel. There is still no solution that would scale to 100 million users better than raw bitcoin.",1524124552,19/04/2018 07:55:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dd03o/lightning_network_flaws_thoughts/,0

RIP PAYPAL / December 1998 - April 2018,"&gt;We’re changing the balance functionality for your PayPal account depending on whether we have been able to verify identifying information that you provide to us. 

&gt;If we have not verified your identifying information, a balance in your PayPal account can generally only be held in your PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card.

&gt;If we have verified your identifying information, a balance in your PayPal account can be held in your PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.

&gt;We’re removing the variable rate pricing for sending money to friends and family members who have PayPal accounts in a country other than the United States when you send money using PayPal balance or your bank account and introducing a new flat fee of $2.99 or $4.99 per transaction depending on the recipient’s country. However, when you send money using your credit card, debit card, or PayPal credit you will be charged the new flat fee per transaction depending on the recipient’s country + 2.9% of the transaction amount + a fixed fee based on the currency.

https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full

&gt;Our updated Privacy Policy will be effective on April 19, 2018 

No more stealth accounts, no more unverified accounts, no more PayPal balance. Basically, you're limited to one account, and one account only. 

Sending money to family members is now [more expensive](https://i.imgur.com/9wAyOaj.png) than using BTC.

Given the new revelation that all crypto to crypto trades are a taxable event, and given that this was only recently advised by the IRS.

Does this apply begining from when they announced it, or from the most recent tax year, or is it considered applicible in retrospect back to when bitcoin was first invented?

Mission accomplished: Tax return accepted with hundreds of crypto trades reported as like-kind exchange!!!,"As the title says, I got my tax return accepted where I reported ~100+ of crypto-to-crypto trades as like-kind exchange!

This was a massive saving (or better deferral) of taxes since some trades generated quite massive ""gains"", like this:

* Nov 2017, BTC @ ~$8,500: Bitcoin -&gt; shitcoin 
* Dec 2017, BTC @ ~$17,000: shitcoin -&gt; Bitcoin

In this trade even if you lose Bitcoin (!!!) you are still selling the shitcoin for massive gains, easily ~100% gains in USD! If you add to this various airdrops (BCash and BTG converted to BTC), all of a sudden you ""made huge profits"" in USD.

My tax bill from all of this would have been pretty hefty, more than $10k. And I have no fucking fiat to show for it!!! (And it really doesn't take all that much trading to rack up this much in tax by trading altcoins in a year when Bitcoin goes parabolic.)

Anyway, all is well now, massive tax bill disaster averted. For now.

And for anyone who cares, I've used LIFO by putting together a giant and ugly spreadsheet which is not even proof of concept since most of the tracking was manual. Have no code to share... and at this point it doesn't even make much sense to code it up, since rule 1031 has been changed.

Bitcoin blocksize discussion,"A year has passed since the peak of block size limit debate. We've got SegWit, we have a beta Lightning Network on mainnet that is growing nicely, seems like Schnorr signatures are around the corner and Bulletproofs somewhere on the horizon - all those allow to use block space more and more efficiently.

However I'd like to revive a *discussion* about block size limit because I think now is the good time to do it. We've parted ways with ""the other sub"" significantly, we're not experiencing extreme transaction fees (whether due to spam attacks or high demand), this is the time when neither emotions nor a sense urgency will affect the conversation (or at least they shouldn't).

I guess my only question is how many of you think that current 1MB limit is *the right* limit and how do we go about figuring out *what* the right limit is and how to *transition* to it?

I highly doubt anybody believes this, fairly arbitrary, number is perfect - probability of that is vanishingly small. I also doubt that there exists such a number at all - surely it must be a function of the blockchain history, akin to the difficulty but maybe with significantly larger update interval.

What are your thoughts?

pinging /u/nullc as the last time i tried asking this question in IRC, the answer i got was quite vague.

The email the developers sent me noted that there would be more challenges and/or contests. I know this reads a lot like an ad, but my honest opinion is that it is a lot of fun. Its difficult enough to be a challenge but not frustratingly so, and it introduces new elements regularly to keep your interest. 

Thanks Cubiscape devs!!

Bitcoin Payments via NFC at Point of Sale Terminals,"So, just sitting around chatting with friends about Bitcoin adoption ideas and started to wonder, does anyone know of a company trying to include Bitcoin payments at point of sale terminals via a NFC reader?

For example:

Currently you can have a cashier punch in a price owed on a cashier.  User taps the NFC reader with their debit/credit card/phone and the amount owed is removed from their account.

What could be added to this system is that the store has a Bitcoin wallet address pre\-programmed into their device.      

1. Cashier punches in the cost in fiat and the reader updates with the price converted to BTC at the current exchange rate based off of whatever exchange they use.  
2. User has a NFC enabled device that contains their wallet address \(card, fob, phone, biometric implant, etc\) which is pre\-loaded with however much they are willing to carry around in that hot wallet which they tap on the store's device to authorize, just like the existing debit/credit NFC payments
3. Transaction takes place and BTC is moved from user wallet to store wallet. 
4. Store either keeps their BTC or auto converts it to fiat at current rate. Some exchanges already offer this capability such as Coinbase and QuadrigaCX.

Some concerns that came up in the discussion were things like:

* Theft.  What if someone steals the user's NFC device and just taps away all their BTC?   \- Sure this could happen however the user would only load as much as they were willing to lose.  This is the same as the current system though!  Your wallet gets stolen, people can tap all your existing NFC cards to make payments on them up to the limits of the tap to pay option plus they get your cash in wallet on top of that.  With this option, you only load what you're willing to carry hot.
* Speed of transaction \- Transaction speeds have been increasing steadily with adoption of technologies improvements like Segwit and Lightning.  As more improvements are made, that will get better and better.
* Fees \- As technology advances improve, fees have been going down.  In addition, with the existing PoS systems, merchants pay fees on transactions as is which could end up being higher than Bitcoin fees as time and tech advances.
* Bitcoin Price Volatility \- Sure, the price of Bitcoin is volatile.  That said, it can go up or down for value whereas fiat pretty much only every goes down in value.  In addition to that, as Bitcoin becomes easier to use as a payment method, more people will use it.  The more people using it, the more that people will buy it.  The more people that buy it, the more likely it is that the price will go up rather than down.

Honestly, after thinking and talking about it with friends I'd be shocked if companies like Visa, Mastercard or Interac aren't trying to implement a system like this into their existing systems in order to be first to market.  If one of them were to roll out this to their offerings and make it an easy option for businesses to adopt then they could jump the rest of the market on it all.  They could tack on their own fees as part of it like they do with credit and debit transactions and take in even more money.

Alternatively, the standalone companies making the point of sale terminals could include it as an automatic conversion item and take fees for it themselves for the service.

Anyways, just an idea to throw out into the wild that may be able to increase mass user adoption and the long term use of Bitcoin!

Anything I Should Know about Paper Wallets,"Hello again! I am a non-technical user who has been holding my Bitcoin on paper wallets for quite some time now. 

My holdings are on multiple paper wallets which were created before Segwit, and all the other updates to Bitcoin. 

Is there anything I should know when I choose to sweep my wallets? I am very ""non-technical"" here. I have swept a wallet many times before, but this was before many of the new updates to Bitcoin and Bitcoin wallets.

If I sweep my non-segwit paper wallet into a Segwit address, will there be any problems? Or will my address remain compatible with something like Mycelium or Coinomi? (Are there better wallets for Android I should use?)

Any interest in a Bitcoin spend-and-replace mobile wallet?,"In considering my next project, I want to make something that solves a problem.  
  
One problem I think worthwhile to solve is the conflicting idea that bitcoin is both a store of value and a currency. Why would you want to spend your bitcoin now when it will be worth more in the future?  

A popular proposed solution is spend and replace. Every time you buy something with bitcoin you replace that spent bitcoin. This is is nice because you get to use your bitcoin, which increases adoption, but you also retain that bitcoin for future growth. It's personally how I do things :).  

However, many claim this is too much of a hassle (ignoring the fees incurred when buying from somewhere like Coinbase). 
  
So I thought what if there was a wallet with a built in feature that ***automatically rebuys whatever bitcoin was spent***, either on a per-transaction or a daily/weekly/monthly basis. I know it's a stretch, but maybe Coinbase or other onboarders would lower their fees for something like this because it helps adoption as well as their bottom line as it  encourages more buying.  
  
I would like this wallet to have another feature (for US tax reporting) but I don't know if it would be beneficial because I'm not an accountant.  
**Can one file capital gains taxes (in the US) on bitcoin using a specific UTXO instead of general LIFO of FIFO accounting method?** If so, I think I can bake a feature into the wallet where when spending bitcoin it uses the most tax efficient UTXOs based on the time they entered the wallet and the current exchange rate.  
  
Either way I would love to hear people's thoughts on this idea, maybe even work together with someone who finds it appealing.  
Thanks",1524165863,19/04/2018 19:24:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dhcql/any_interest_in_a_bitcoin_spendandreplace_mobile/,2

Just saw my first planned Dapp going to use RSK,"This is not an ico promotion or shit. Just surprised to see it.
If you don't know what rsk is a bitcoin sidechain. RSK achieves 100-300 transactions per second on chain and confirms most payments in less than 20 seconds, while leveraging Bitcoin's proof of work security(merged mining).
Rootstock uses the DECOR + GHOST protocol to reduce the block interval to an average of 10 seconds, which is lower than the current Ethereum block with an average block interval of 16 seconds.
With the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP), RSK will be able to process up to 2000 tps on chain! Source: wikipedia 
And more scaling is on the way to RSk.

So what is this dapp platform: 
https://toss.pro/
According to their ""shortpaper""(they have a longer whitepaper) there going to be using rsk:
https://toss.pro/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ShortPaper.pdf

It looks cool but IDK is it safe do your research!!!
I am not going to buy it-study it on your own term. 
I just surprised to see this planned Dapp.
Hope more Dapps are made on rsk soon :)
Also Lapps too but some things can't be made on Lapps so...
Rsk still has a place.

Kraken CEO proves lack of accountability,"Read this:                                                                                                              https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-exchange-kraken-may-have-to-comply-with-new-york-ag-push-for-transparency-2018-04-19
After reading this article I was slightly enraged at the audacity of Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken. He made comments calling the office of AG Eric Schneiderman entitled, disrespectful, hostile and a waste of his time. This aggressive and overly defensive comment comes at an especially interesting time, considering Kraken's terrible customer service, which is openly criticized by thousands of people all over the world wide web. 
I have personally experienced this total disregard for customers and transparency first hand. Kraken seems to operate to a law of their own. From openly being disrespectful to costumer messages, to now denying and not recognizing what would give customers the very security that they are repeatedly asking for. 
Whether or not filling out the questionnaire for the AG is too much to ask or what their intentions are aside, I find it hypocritical of someone in charge of such bad costumer service to criticize anyone.  It is the actions of badly run exchanges that fuel regulators to come in and take heavy-handed actions. 
Just for disclosure: Kraken has been holding my 10k sent to a wrong address after a fork. Costumer service was basically rude, gave me absolutely no timeline on when I would get my money back and this is when they still answered support tickets. I haven't heard from them in months.
Kraken- Sail the high seas of BS.

Poland this Friday 13:00 protest against 1000% tax on btc,"PL gov decided to apply PCC tax (1% of value of each trade) to BTC. This means bot owners could owe more then 100% in tax, they can lose all BTC and be in debt.

According to reports (please correct me if I'm wrong) there are approximately 30 million bitcoin users today. 30 million squared equals 900 trillion. Bitcoins current market cap is 141 billion dollars, so according to metcalfe's law then currently Bitcoins market cap should be 900 trillion dollars. Also according to CCN there will be an estimated 200 million Bitcoin users in the year 2024. 200 million squared is 4.00000000E+16.

How would Bitcoin survive/adapt in case of a permanent internet fragmentation?,"As you might have heard, here in Russia the communications oversight department have spent the last 4 days ~~tilting at windmills~~ trying to block a certain messenger, which resulted in major cloud services being partially or completely blocked.

While this particular quixotic effort is unlikely to effect any change, it does raise an interesting what if.

Governments around the world want stronger and stronger grasp of the internet, and find themselves more and more impotent. Many have been, implicitly or explicitly, effecting some means of censoring and blocking content on the net, which continues to produce more and more decentralised systems.

The endgame of this shell vs armour race can very well be cutting the wires across the borders. It's close to reality in China, a possibility that have been hinted at in Russia, and is not outside of the realm of possibility for several other countries. After all, nationalism and self-sufficiency is vogue right now, and arguments against people being able to cross the borders are in full swing.

So let's say we got to that point, and countries started to disconnect from each other. Instead of a global internet we now have North American net, Chinese net, European net, Russian net and so on.

How would Bitcoin adapt to this scenario? Can it even survive as a single network in that case?",1524198960,20/04/2018 04:36:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dkyxx/how_would_bitcoin_surviveadapt_in_case_of_a/,2

"Doing an essay for uni, struggling to find proper info!","Hi! I'm sure most information is second nature to you and I'm wondering if you could answer some questions and or help me find sources with proper preferably easy to understand information as most is VERY repetetive, obvious or building on the hype that lead to it becoming mainstream.

For example:

* What online currency was used before bitcoin for let's say online black market drug trading, any deep web trades etc?

* How does the correlation between bitcoin and its stocks work? (Sorry if retarded question)

* What are the most important events in its history?

* Can a person see anyones transaction history and amount of bitcoin simply by having their transaction code?

* How long does it take to make a transaction right now and how high is the fee?

* When mining bitcoin do you always earn the same amount of money, lets say 1 hour with 2 identical PC setups = 0.002 bitcoin? Or is there any luck involved or such?

* Any way to see the current total value in bitcoin and how it has increased overtime?



Individual questions to you.

* What do you think are the main threats facing bitcoin?

* What is your reasoning for investing and what do you use it for and such?

Sorry if most of these are too obvious since I can with minimal effort probably find the answers by searching, I'm in a bit of a hurry. If you only want to answer one question that isn't super obvious I'd greatly appreciate it!

Also as English isn't my first language and certain FAQ pages go into great technical detail and such I generally don't understand all of it ",1524204604,20/04/2018 06:10:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dlg4a/doing_an_essay_for_uni_struggling_to_find_proper/,0

"New tool for finding, filtering and tracking your airdrops","Hello everyone, after doing a lot of airdrops and making lists of them for my friends i decided to build up on that. Create a tool that makes it easy to participate in a lot of Airdrops.

I will update the website frequently with new Airdrops and infos about them. Featured Airdrops have 4 states: upcoming-&gt;active-&gt;finished-&gt;paid.

You can also track which ones you have done and then filter through those any many more properties. f.e. show all undone active airdrops. or all paid done ones, etc.

I am in early stage of development, a lot in mind to add, and would like any feedback!

Bitcoin rise to $8300. Experts: bull market is coming.,"The cryptocurrency market shows its trend of rising like the past few days. Now [bitcoin price](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-from-sudden-dip-eyeing-move-to-8400/) is over $8300. 	The continuously rise of Bitcoin in a few days increases the investors’ confidence. Many analysts thinks crytocurrency is entering bull market.



The CEO of Rewardstoken. Io, Todd Rowan stated his opinion, “It may be the new cycle of bull market. Bitcoin becomes the motivation of cryptocurrency. Now, it seems that the underselling period is coming, which is benefit to everyone.”



However, [bitcoin value](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin) has not broken through $8600 yet. The analyst Charlie Chan believed that the break even of bitcoin mining industry doesn’t appear. He said, “The break even point of the pooled mining we estimated is $8600 on condition that the electric power cost is very low($3/KWH).” In other word, before bitcoin rise to $8600, any trade in that industry is losing money.",1524215361,20/04/2018 09:09:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dm7xj/bitcoin_rise_to_8300_experts_bull_market_is_coming/,6

Connecticut.
Hawaii.
Nebraska.
Alaska.
North Carolina.

What do these places have in common?  They are U.S. states where the Coin Center and the ULC have been pushing for bitlicense to be made law.  In New York, where bitlicense was passed as a regulation, the battle against it is being waged in the courts. North Carolina passed its own bitlicense law.  In all the other states above, there are ***right now bitlicense bills that have been introduced which you can help stop.***

Firstly I assume it wont be on chain, as it would require huge blocks to accommodate the volume of gold contacts traded. So the volume would I assume happen on a lightning network. Is that right? settlement would then take place on the bitcoin blockchain? How would this be different to the current gold market?

*Bitcoin Cash also known as BCash is a simple hard fork of Bitcoin. Its shillers have tried to convince people that BCash is the real Bitcoin, but everyone knows that the real Bitcoin is Bitcoin.*

What is the best Virtual Credit Card there is?,"hi, I need to make a purchase online and I actually need to do it with a credit card. 

The thing is though,  I don't have a physical credit card, I don't want to wait for it, but I have some bitcoins.

What I need to do is, convert my BTC into USD in an exchange and get the USD in a virtual card. But I don't know which one to choose. Which virtual credit card provider would you recommend??

I can open 1 or 2 vcc's and experiment with small amounts, but I need ones with the best rates in terms of percentage charged for loading money into your virtual card and overall fees, monthly fees, ATM fees, initial cost (if there's any).

If you've used any virtual credit cards, could you please share your experience. It would be really helpful.

Thank you in advance!

P.S. I am aware there are some physical credit card providers, but many of them do not support countries outside of EEA/SEPA zone.",1524228210,20/04/2018 12:43:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dn9mc/what_is_the_best_virtual_credit_card_there_is/,1

People are not learning the fundementals at all.,BCH yet again is pumping and people have not learned that for a crypto to be successful long term it must be decentralized or it looses its advantage. Huge blocks will invariably be more centralized on the main chain vis a vis nodes allowing for easy take over in the future by centralists and political entities.  I'm not sure what people are thinking but it is discouraging to realize that STUPID MONEY has not been flushed out.  I'm not against alts that provide a niche and have a chance at highly decentralized main chains but BCH does not offer a niche. Who is buying that crap?  I can understand people buying sia and cloak and lots of others even though I'm a 95% purist as they will serve a niche but WTF is it with bcash? They do Nothing better than any other alt coins.

Tracking down BTC transaction.,"Long story short I sent a guy some BTC and he never sent me my mining rig.

Is there any way to see if this transaction hash below went to an a Coinbase account?  If so then I can have the police contact Coinbase to pull any account info based on this transaction.   Any help would be appreciated.

The only requirement was that it had to go live in two weeks and that all profits would be donated to charity. 

I, like many of you here in /r/Bitcoin are super into not only the technology, but also the culture around the crypto community. My goal was to build something that I as a crypto fan would be proud to shop at and sell things I'd actually wear. I hope I did that in https://cryptocrow.co/ 

I'm posting here to get feedback and seek any ideas you'd also want to see offered on the site. There's a long road ahead, but this is all I could build in the time allotted. 

What was funny about the idea is that some coworkers  mentioned they thought this might not work because the crypto community isn't big enough. I hope this project proves that notion wrong.

So check it out and lemme know what ya think!

Does Lightning network almost solve the anonymity problem in Bitcoin?,"Why is this feature of the Lightning network getting so little attention? Am I missing something?

The Lightning network is built using the onion Tor-like routing which essentially means that nodes have just one hop information so transactions are not possible to trace.

And the good news is that if you have two wallets, in wallet ""A"" you have the Bitcoin coming from the exchange where you provided your data so those are associated to you, if you create a wallet ""B"" and transfer the funds through Lightning, when you settle the transaction on the blockchain it is not traceable.

"CNBC gave me $1,000 to start a business in 14 days, so I launched a crypto apparel line","In a strange, one-of-a-kind assignment, I was given $1,000 and told to launch a business -- any business. The only requirement was that it had to go live in two weeks and that all profits would be donated to charity.

I, like many of you here in /r/Bitcoin are super into not only the technology, but also the culture around the crypto community. My goal was to build something that I as a crypto fan would be proud to shop at and sell things I'd actually wear. I hope I did that in https://cryptocrow.co/

I'm posting here to get feedback and seek any ideas you'd also want to see offered on the site. There's a long road ahead, but this is all I could build in the time allotted.

What was funny about the idea is that some coworkers mentioned they thought this might not work because the crypto community isn't big enough. I hope this project proves that notion wrong.

So check it out and lemme know what ya think! Thanks in advance for any thoughts!

Brother had Bitcoin and passed away. How to access?,"Hey folks,

Without delving into the shitstorm of hell that my life became on April 10th, my brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack 10 days ago; he was 49 and this just should not have happened. 

Despite my being knee-deep in grief at the moment, I'm also likely going to be in charge of probating his estate; my dude lived  across the country in Colorado and had a home, a couple vehicles etc. that needs to be dealt with. He also owned a small amount of Bitcoin as well as two alts, all of which he was managing via the Breadwallet iPhone app.

Ideally, I would like to either transfer his BTC/alts to my wallet or (perhaps better for probating the estate) just gain access to his wallet and keep his balance as is. Even though he only had a small amount of cryptos, we were both really into it in recent months and I know for a fact that he would want to HODL rather than cash things out (I wish he was around to see the recent uptick). 

I have his phone, but his 14-word key is very likely hidden in some box at his house out in Colorado. We talked briefly about it when I went out to visit him in February but just changed the subject because again, this was not supposed to happen. I'm assuming my first step is going out there and digging for that, but I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on what the best course of action here would be.

Would you buy a Bitcoin for 8$ ?,"Sorry if i sound irritable or stoopeed, but...

We have a problem with making the mass understand why bitcoin is financially abordable for every individual.

People want to solve it by introducing the BIT or the FINEY or the SATOSHI... but honestly it only introduce more confusion and only talks to people deep into btc.

I remember in the beginnings where you would mine a block and obtain 200 bitcoins...  
It felt real, it felt abundant, it felt like we were rich.

Nowadays, someone owning 0.645381 bitcoin could consider himself one lucky man, and that sounds ridiculous. 

In order to make it sounds richer, we should call it 645 bit... But who does that anyway ?

MY POINT IS... Why dont we change the unit of the bitcoin? Nobody wants to buy 0.645 bitcoin for 5K $...
But DAMN it sounds right to buy 645 bitcoins !!!

Seriously, let’s just assume 1 BTC is 1000 Bitcoin !!! 

Everybody looks rich, 
Newcomer will sounds more interested,
1 Bitcoin would value around 8$ which looks like a really FAIR and COMMERCIAL price !!!

Disclaimer: Honestly, I don’t want to sound like one of the BCH marketing guy who wants to get rich quick, I have engineering background. But hell guys, lets stop to pretend 8K$/BTC is an honest price. It is freaking too expensive. I know some of you wont feel it right, but think about your friend who doesn’t know a but about coding, a bit about blockchain or even a bit about bitcoin. Now assume that guy represent 98% of the damn world population. 

So ask yourself, would you buy a bitcoin for 8$? 
If the answer is yes, we should definitely consider, as a community, to make a change.",1524261827,20/04/2018 22:03:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8drexw/would_you_buy_a_bitcoin_for_8/,0

Japanese tax selling pressure is over! (it had probably much more impact than US one),"Japan has:

- One of the biggest trade volume pair
- Every crypto-to-crypto trade is a taxable event
- Taxes usually 33%+, up to 55% (considered as income tax, not capital gain)
- Highly regulated exchanges, so I expect most people properly pay their taxes

Combined with the december peak, easy to see how many people trading in Japan had huge tax-debts that resulted in a *huge* sell pressure (esp. those hoping price would increase more/again before paying taxes). Looking at the tax rates and current prices, some people might still even be negative.

Now, most people focused on March 15th (Japanese tax filing deadline) but many people choose to pay their taxes with automatic bank transfer, which happens on April 20th.",1524266488,20/04/2018 23:21:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8drx2r/japanese_tax_selling_pressure_is_over_it_had/,4

A friendly reminder about euphoria,"Just a note for all of our noobs and veterans alike. 

Bitcoin goes up. Bitcoin goes down.

 Don't FOMO into Bitcoin (or any altcoins) in this short term upswing if you would be upset with a 30% correction in a week. 

Don't give into FOMO unless you know what you're doing, know what the risks are, or are prepared to hold. 

Bitcoin can go down just as quickly as it goes up. 

Remember how you felt when it hit 6000 and ask yourself if you want to go through that again. ",1524266806,20/04/2018 23:26:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8drya9/a_friendly_reminder_about_euphoria/,0

How hodl BTC tells you how people realy are,"Although I advocate don't tell anyone how much you hodl, when educating others denying that you hodl any is not working either.

But after hodling, and adding, for a year has been very entertaining and informative about the true mindset of a lot of 'friends', colleagues, etc.

The recent, and to be honest even for a believer rather scary, downturn has shown some real remarkable attitudes.
The most revealing goes like this:
When stepping in and discussing BTC the remark was you are nuts what the fu.. is this and and why would you put money in it.

I thought after some discussion I made my points and let it go.
Then the big surge came.
To my surprise some did follow it because they came to me with remarks like wow it is now at value X why don't you take your profits?

Again I tried to do some explaining why I went into BTC and why I did see no reason to convert back to fiat.
While BTC kept rising the discussions turned to some more hostile ones, and I still can remember some who just declared me nuts for not stepping out of a ten time gain.
Only one of the people who new my stace and had been thinking about stepping in himself told me he was regretting not doing so.

Then the downturn came.
Some where actually happy because it was just unfair that something that stupid could rise that much and thus that people stupid enough to 'gamble' could gain so much.
Most reasoned that it had been too easy and no one deserves to make money in such an easy way.

Of course I tried to argue if it was that easy why they didn't join in making such easy money and most will recognize the reply...

Mind you most of the people I talk about are highly educated, Phd and higher.

After baring some months of remarks how stupid I was to not listening to them to get out, the first BTC's I bought have been more than three times their purchasing value even at the low of the downturn, it is getting a bit quiet at the moment.

So now I'm just waiting for the next blowoff top and preparing myself fot the remarks and envy I know is comming.

Most important lesson I can share:
Never tell anyone how much BTC you really hodl.
And if telling people, for the right reasons, you do own BTC it is rather hard to be too low on your reported position because of the enormous moves BTC can make in a few years.

I thought I found love.,"Hi guys.

I just met what I thought was the love of my life. She was all that I hoped for in a woman. Our cryptotalks were so exciting and we often talked about HODLing together, forever. 

She knew that I had some cryptocurrencies stacked away in my wallet, as I didn't think that was something to keep secret. Happiness, love, oh what a fool I am.
I recently found out she had the same relationship with four other guys:(

Could GDPR can protect Bitcoin Users,"&gt;""Pseudonymisation is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).

&gt;Although the GDPR encourages the use of pseudonymisation to ""reduce risks to the data subjects"" (Recital 28), pseudonymised data is still considered personal data (Recital 26) and so remains covered by the GDPR.""

I believe bitcoin addresses can be classified as pseudonymised data. Therefore should be covered under GDPR. This could effect companies like chainanalysis which tries and cluster bitcoin addresses and associated these to individuals - using various data sources ( eg withdrawal addresses from exchanges, api's ect).

Furthermore if an exchange is hacked revealing all withdraw addresses for a user their privacy could be totally compromised, therefore it make sense for exchanges to not store this information beyond what is required by other regulation. (KYC &amp; AML ) eg they can report suspicious transactions however they should delete withdrawal information after one or two years because its no longer relevant. 

Do you think it might be possible to sue ChainAnalysis?",1524308142,21/04/2018 10:55:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dv2bg/could_gdpr_can_protect_bitcoin_users/,0

Can you give me a reason why I should invest in Bitcoin?,"First I thought that bitcoin is a great thing and will certainly be a part of our future, but the use of bitcoin gets destroyed by the big fluctuations due to the fact that the biggest part of bitcoin owners are traders and not people who actually use them.

Bitcoin full node operators - can you help me.,"So I've started running a full node again from behind a standard internet connection in the UK. I found that my node was reachable using the bitnodes website - initially at least. Then after a few days, although I always had a few incoming connections, I was no longer reachable at least according to bitnodes. I noticed that the longer I left the node doing its thing, the more the number of active connections seemed to decrease. Is this down to my isp shaping some of my traffic? If anyone can throw some light on how to run a full node from behind a typical home connection I'd be very grateful. 

Thanks

Question about LN and the viability of Bitcoin in its current state,"The network supports around 500,000 transactions per day. Post-segwit. That's 180 millions transactions per year.

I read that you need 3 transactions to open / close a segwit channel.

So at most we could have 60 millions additional channels per year. There are 6 billions people in this world, excluding businesses, and not all on-chain transactions will be lightning related. Also, people might need more than one channel in practice.

Don't get me wrong, I am sure that LN will allow us to boost the network's capacity but what I am saying is that it might not be enough to transform Bitcoin into a true global currency.",1524311670,21/04/2018 11:54:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dvayq/question_about_ln_and_the_viability_of_bitcoin_in/,2

Bitcoin.org has some really cool links I’ve never heard of until browsing around there,"Some of my favorites I discovered:

[opendime.com](opendime.com) - Pass bitcoin along like cash

[https://bisq.network](https://bisq.network) - A decentralized bitcoin exchange 

[https://spendabit.co](https://spendabit.co) Search across hundreds of stores that accept bitcoin 

[https://foldapp.com](https://foldapp.com) Spend bitcoin in the real world (app coming soon)

Never heard of any of these accept maybe bisq which looks really promising. Has anyone used it? 

Spendabit looks like it’ll really come in handy in the future. Opendime looks REALLY cool, a little expensive though. And foldapp seems like a bitcoin app that you can use to pay with in person at places that don’t accept bitcoin like Starbucks. I can dig that! 

[bitcoin.org](bitcoin.org) also has network status updates. I wonder how fast it gets updated in an emergency though. Overall there is tons of useful stuff there! Seen anything there you didn’t know about until checking it out?

Another day passes and money still not credited in my Kraken account,"Hi there, 

I have been watching the market fluctuate and moving up. 

That made me to quickly deposit amount of Euros from my bank account into my Kraken account. I did the same many previous times as well. This time, however, I received a message from Kraken that apparently I deposited money without my Public Account ID, which is not true at all, since I use the same template for all my payments to Kraken. I have sent them a proof of the payment swift from the Bank, were they clearly saw that my Public Account ID was in the Reference field of the transaction.

I received a response from Kraken team as follows:

""Hello xxx,

We have received your deposit but it takes a little longer to process deposits that don't have the reference on them. You will receive an automated deposit notification email once it hits your account.

Thank you for your patience.""

In the mean time, crypto prices have gone way up from the day that I wanted to make a transfer and purchase some!!!

This is outrageous and totally unacceptable for me. It makes me also reluctant to continue with other deposits and working with Kraken.

I have also tried to accelerate the ticket but with not much luck.

Another day passes by. I hope someone from support is actually listen who can help.

Transaction fees during current bull run,"So out of curiosity I checked what the average transaction fees were during this current run up and compared them to the transactions fees when the price was at a similar level during the bull run of late 2017.  Here's a few data points to compare when the 2017 price  (left columns) roughly matches the 2018 price (right columns):

BTC Price/Date (2017)|Transaction Fee|BTC Price/Date (2018)|Transaction Fee
:--|:--|:--|:--
$4090 - 8/21/17|$3.19|NA|NA
$3901 - 9/21/17|$1.43|NA|NA
$5997 - 10/21/17|$2.31|NA|NA
$6778 - 11/2/17|$4.12|$6848 - 4/5/18|$0.21
$8039 - 11/20/17|$7.02|$7999 - 4/15/18|$0.35
$8206 - 11/21/17|$6.24|$8287 - 4/20/18|$0.41

This is obviously a very limited amount of data, but it's very striking none the less.  The last time transaction fees were this low the price of BTC was around $1000.

A word of warning,"Hey guys, I'd like to share a few of my sentiments on the current rally. My short term outlook is bullish, but the next several months I believe will be bearish. I still think we will see another bubble and a return to 20k sometime either late this year or next year.

Anyhow, I believe that this current rally is being driven by a small group of actors who intentionally cooperate to pump the price whenever it dips or tries to correct. They started the move with a short squeeze, but they are intent on carrying bitcoin higher. I believe their target is above 9000. They may stall at 9400, but they might try to carry the price much higher, as high as 11.5k. The problem with this rally is that it was not backed by genuine buyer sentiment, and it isn't driven by organic trades.  Instead, it is heavily manipulated by trading robots and whales who make coordinated buys across exchanges. It simply isn't natural for the price to rally from 6800 to 9000 without a correction during a bear trend. Last night we tried to correct, but money jumped in around 8600. I don't know if this was organic or not.

(Just fyi: a short position is when you borrow bitcoin from someone, sell it right away, and then try to buy back in lower. So, if you short 1btc at 11k and the price drops to 10k, you buy back 1 btc and make 1000$. Because this trade involves borrowing money, it is a leveraged position and is subject to liquidation. A short squeeze happens when too many people short an asset, which then rises quickly in value. The rising value triggers either stop-losses or liquidation and drives prices higher. That's what happened to btc on April 12)

So, who are they? What do they want? You must realize that bitcoin has a tiny market cap compared to the net worth of some players out there. A few million can add hundreds of millions to the market cap, at times. I've heard that George Soros recently allowed one of his funds to trade bitcoin, which is weird since he used to be anti-bitcoin. I have no idea what they want, but I don't think they want to return the bull market. Public interest in bitcoin has been [waning since the bubble burst](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin), and a lot of money has left the exchanges altogether. Now, if this rally causes a surge of public interest in bitcoin, we might see a return to bubble-era prices. But, I doubt that will happen because most investors got burned from the last bubble and will be wary of losing their shirts again.

So, if you sold below 7k, don't feel bad, as you had no way to expect this manipulated pump. It is most likely safe to buy back in now, but be careful buying as you get higher. If the price gets up to 11k, please don't buy in as it is simply too late and there is strong resistance there. Also don't buy near 9.4k as there is strong resistance there as well. Expect there to be strong support (for now) around 7.9 and 8.1k. A lot of people opened short positions around there (shorting bitcoin is dangerous even in a bear market.) and will try to close them at a small gain or minor loss if the price gets that low again. Closing a short has the same effect as initiating a long, as it drives the price up.

So, long story short... this is a manipulated move. Expect unpredictable spikes either up or down. I don't know how high the manipulator(s) want to drive the price, which means it is very dangerous to trade. I also don't know if they are trying to benevolently ""save"" bitcoin (I doubt that they are benevolent, given that they orchestrated a short squeeze...lol). There is a theory that they are trying to eliminate the money that was buying at 6k. Basically, they will pump btc to 10 or 11k, and then everyone fomo's in, and then they dump. Now, they have all the cash and all the other people have bitcoin. Now, when bitcoin dumps to 6k, there's not as much money waiting. This time, it slips right through which damages market structure and causes panic selling. I know this may sound impossible, but it would be very similar to what we had in 2014.

I'm sorry to sound so bearish. You are more than welcome to disagree with me. Just be aware that this move will probably not play out the way you want it to. Just as the bitcoin shorters got their clocks cleaned, the bitcoin longs will probably get wrecked somewhere between 9.5k and 11.5k. My advice is to buy or trade carefully, and try to set a tight stop loss. It's much better to be safe than sorry. Bitcoin isn't out of this bear market until we get bought aggressively at 12k *and* hold up there for several days in a bullish formation.

Please feel free to comment. It is simply my opinion, but please be respectful in your comments. As a disclaimer, no I did not sell at 7k. I sold around 14k and have been simply watching the market since the crash. I'd like to buy back in at some point, but I want to see price stabilize first.

Thanks for your time.

tl;dr this was a manipulated pump and may be yet another bull trap. be very careful.

I think people think of Bitcoin in the wrong denominations.,"IMHO When people talk of bitcoin, they are using the wrong denomination.

Bitcoins should be thought of as the gold bars (1000g of gold) of crypto currency.  The middle class could/should never own a gold bar, as there are better ways to store wealth (land, stock, etc).

Similarly mBTC's analog would be an ounce of gold.

When thinking about Bitcoin as a currency, bits and satoshi's are the denominations that middle class people will use.

Now, let me hit you with some napkin math on why precisely bits and satoshi's will be what people speak in if/when BTC hits mainstream.

The GDP per capital over the entire world is roughly valued at [$8000USD/year](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/MateNagy.shtml).  This includes the richest of the rich, and poorest of the poor.  By 2030 the worlds population will be 8.5billion people.  Thus we can napkin math and say that the GDP of the world in 2030 might be close to 70trillion dollars. *note: obviously the networth of the entire world is much higher than this, but lets go with GDP per-capita for our maths here*

If Bitcoin becomes the dominant unit of trade by 2030, this means that the 21Million bitcoin will cover the value of that 70trillion USD GDP.  Meaning that a bitcoin would be worth around $3.2M USD.

Obviously, such exchanges are going to be extraordinarily rare.  But what about satoshi's?  A bitcoin worth 3.2M would mean a satoshi is worth 3.2 cents, and thus a bit would be worth 3.2 dollars.

Now THOSE are nice units of value for common trade.  You'll basically be paying 50 satoshi for a candy bar, which isn't an alien value for people to understand.

Of course, it's a huge IF that bitcoin becomes the dominant unit of trade.  Bitcoins will be useless if Quantum computers can crack a private key; Governments will push HARD on cryptocurrency if their fiat (and thus control of the populace) is truly tested; and the current banking system could implement a more trustworthy and cheap method of conducting business **in the eyes of the general population** *(note: I am specifically saying that the banks might trick the normies into believing in a new form of credit card is more trustworthy)*.  I haven't added any of that into my napkin math.",1524337232,21/04/2018 19:00:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dxt2e/i_think_people_think_of_bitcoin_in_the_wrong/,2

How to setup small businesses to accept bitcoin via Lightning network?,"Hello

Several small businesses I frequent only accept payment in cash or cheque because of high transaction fees on credit cards and other forms of payment.  The businesses are totally above board, they charge tax, give receipts etc.  So they aren't cash-only so that they can high income from the government.

This is super annoying to me, because it means I have to withdraw cash from an ATM before I can pay them.  The businesses are rural, so the closest bank/ATM is 10 minutes away.  This means I have to plan on going to the bank before I go to their business.

So as a thought experiment, how could I suggest to them that they start accepting payment in bitcoin via lightning network (raw bitcoin itself would be not acceptable because of transaction fees and because of the 10 minute wait).

What kind of electronics could they set up beside their cash registers to accept payments, and how can they ""plug themselves in"" to the lightning network?  How can they exchange their payment in bitcoin to local currency with minimum effort in order to pay their employees?",1524338280,21/04/2018 19:18:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dxx64/how_to_setup_small_businesses_to_accept_bitcoin/,2

Banking vs. Bitcoin,"Generalisation based on my own experience, your country might vary 

Opening a bank account

1. Ensure you are over the age of 18, or have a legal guardian to sign on your behalf
2. Choose a bank
3. Consider the types of accounts based on your eligibility
4. Ensure you are a resident of the country you are looking to open the account
5. Read and accept any Agreements and Terms and conditions to form a binding contact between you and the bank
6. Provide your full name, email, personal, work, and mobile contact information
7. Provide proof of identify, either passport or government issued identify document
8. Provide proof of residence usually not exceeding more than 3 months (ensure this is kept up to date when you move)
9. Provide proof of income based on the type of account
10. Deposit a minimum opening balance
12. Keep the account open with a minimum balance and administration fee
13. Deposit money into the custodial control of the bank on a regular basis to ensure the operation and status going forward

"Looking to learn all the mechanisms, discussion questions, opinions thoughts etc!","I've been reading now for roughly 12-14 hours as well as videos ETC. I feel like I understand most but there's few things I'm unsure of/inconsistencies. Trying to become one of you/write a research paper. Perhaps even teach others on this subreddit who might not be too sure either :)!

If you would like to take part and help me it'd be greatly appreciated, mainly because I feel like to many of you this is pure second nature and most sources I find are extremely repetetive/too technical/biased or building on hype/too advanced English as a non-native speaker. 

Mainly looking to get a general understanding rather than perfect technical knowledge etc, one or two simple sentences even if it doesn't accurately portray it would be awesome.

Regarding mining:

* Is the reward strictly dependant on how many hashes you try to break? Let's say 5 identical mining at same performance doing 1 trillion attempts per hour. Is there any form of luck/chance factor? Could a block be opened in 1min or 25min instead of the average 9-11?

* Are the people offering higher fee's to get their transactions made faster automatically picked up by miners or intentionally chosen or by chance? Does the paid fee get evenly distributed?

* Is the maximum transactions limit currently 7 per second?

Halving of coins:

* When the amount of coins is halved in 2020 odds are quite a few miners will stop mining as their revenue is cut in half, would that make the 'bitcoin network' less secure or slow down transactions?

Economical/Technical:

* Doesn't increasing the amount of coins daily have an impact on price of bitcoin?

* Isn't the current rather big fee's and wait times for transactions a noteworthy problem? Is it about prioritizing safety?

* Is it necessary to wait for your transaction to go through 6 blocks? Are there security risks only going through 2?

Other:

* Since the entire blockchain is stored and saved, is it possible to easily go through,find all of Satashi Nakamoto's transactions?

* Is Bitcoin Core or other Full nodes necessary to keep the network functioning? Is Bitcoin Core outdated compared to other alternatives? From what I have read the 200gigs, memory usage etc. Are there risks to having too few full node miners? And do full node miners get any more incentives to use full nodes?

* Does any problems come with GPU's being overtaken by ASIC's, much less nodes, profit much more limited to China/India/Iceland ETC

* What has been the key things in the new patches/releases of the mining protocol since its release?

For other's searching Googling etc few words that can be summarized in less than 2 sentences?

Hash, Nodes, Fork (soft/hard), Market cap

Any single answer to anything would be more than greatly appreciated. I will constantly be continuing my research on the questions I asked above as well for the next week+.

Is it true that amazon.com will soon accept bitcoins?,"I received this in an e-mail newsletter from strategictechinvestor.com



Dear Strategic Tech Investor,

In the special report I sent my paid-up members last week, I showed what it would mean for its price if e-commerce giants like Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) start accepting Bitcoin.

In short, Amazon's acceptance of cryptocurrencies would be a bit step toward the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin - and to a price of $100,000.

(I've figured out how Bitcoin could get there. To get my ""math,"" click here.)

While in that report I predicted that Amazon would start accepting Bitcoin ""soon,"" I didn't predict this...

Amazon just received a patent for a ""streaming data marketplace"" that would allow users, including individuals or online retailers, to receive real-time cryptocurrency transaction data.

Now, this doesn't mean that Amazon's 100 million-plus Prime members can start paying for their books and electronics with Bitcoin... yet.

But it does reveal Amazon foresees a day when its customers will use Bitcoin and other cryptos to make fast, cheap, secure payments",1524345747,21/04/2018 21:22:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dypyt/is_it_true_that_amazoncom_will_soon_accept/,0

Anyone else losing faith in bitcoin ever becoming ubiquitous?,"Let me preface this by saying I am a long term crypto enthusiast, I got into bitcoin in 2011 and I've accepted it in my own store since 2012. This is in no way concern trolling or me losing perspective after the most recent crash this winter.

I am simply getting more and more sure that we will never see that utopian world where bitcoin is accepted everywhere and even replaces fiat. I don't think it will die either, but I think it will forever remain niche, reserved for the (relatively few) cases it offers tangible benefits such as being simply unable to pay for something in fiat due to restrictions etc.

There are two main reasons. One is that the main differences of bitcoin which many consider benefits, is actually things that most people either don't care about, or that most people would consider disadvantages. Examples are the non-reversibility, and the total control over your own funds. People want a safety net, they want to be able to chargeback money in case of fraud, and they don't want to be responsible for keeping their own funds safe. With bitcoin, if someone forget a password, or get hacked, they can lose all their money. Most people would never want to use such a system. 

You may say that these problems will disappear over time as more user friendly systems are built on top of bitcoin. But then what is the point? If we have a system that uses bitcoin at the lowest level, but is reversible, and won't allow you to control the funds yourself, and charges fees, then why not just use a normal bank with fiat? You may be okay with such a scenario as long as you have the ability to use your own wallet if you want, but that's my point: I don't think they would allow you to do that. Payment processors would only accept payments through these higher level protocols that may be built on bitcoin but is reversible and requires trust and everything that bitcoin tries to not be. I can't see a way to have the advantages and not the disadvantages too.

The second reason is that even if the system evolves beyond my imagination and becomes ubiquitous in a way that also does allow you to keep all the advantages, society won't allow it. Financial freedom, financial privacy and censorship resistance is something that most people are willing to give up in order to fight crime. Even if you disagree, I think the majority don't, and that's why it will be made law. We're already seeing crackdowns with all exchanges requiring you to give up personal information and some blacklisting customers and blocking transactions for various reasons. If crypto grows in popularity and evidence is uncovered that it is in fact being used to finance f.ex terrorism (like it almost definitely will eventually, if it does grow in popularity), then it will only get worse. Relatively free countries like in the west probably won't outlaw it entirely, but heavy enough restrictions will be put on it to effectively remove its advantages over fiat when it comes to privacy, freedom and censorship resistance.

What do you guys think?",1524347400,21/04/2018 21:50:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dyw5c/anyone_else_losing_faith_in_bitcoin_ever_becoming/,0

Why BTC? (Legitimate Question)," I've been following BTC and the cryptocurrency graphs, markets and news more closely for a couple of months now \- always trying to decide if/when I should buy \- and I'd like to ask a question that I know will probably be unpopular here, but absolutely legitimate.

It is said that BTC will go up a lot more in value as it becomes more widely accepted \(and traditional currencies inflate\) because it is limited in supply. McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \(maybe way more\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \- a couple quite successful among them \- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even ""better"" one \- though ""better"" is relative\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?

So far it seems to me that BTC is \(at least since I started following it \- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\) much more about speculation \(HODL\) than actual usage as payment \- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\+ in value at any moment.

What I'm trying to ask is:

If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?",1524348848,21/04/2018 22:14:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dz1hx/why_btc_legitimate_question/,0

I'm a freelance web designer trying to encourage Bitcoin payments from my clients,"I'm in the process of updating my website and I'm trying to think up ways to 'encourage' Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be used as a method of payment.

I've recently added a ""Bitcoin accepted here"" notice to the nav section of my page for visibility. I haven't accepted any crypto payments yet so I'm trying to plan out how the process will go and make it as smooth and attractive as possible to my clients.

I thought about adding a few of my public wallet addresses onto the page but I think that will look messy and it seems unnecessary as I can provide the address at the time of payment.

I guess what I'm asking is, can anyone with some experience in accepting crypto payments suggest a particularly good way to do so? Or should I just stick with advertising that Bitcoin is accepted and then provide a wallet address at the time of payment?

I understand that there are precautions I can take. Paper dollars, coins, spreading funds and keeping cash out of banks.

None of these options make me feel comfortable enough to risk a substantial portion of my hard earned wealth in an government currency which has proven time and time again to be susceptible to manipulation and theft.

I desperately wanted fiat to work and I am disheartened to submit to bitcoin which essentially makes me a free man to a federal government/reserve bank.

Why I sold all my Beanie Babies,"There is one simple issue with Beanie Babies, and all other stuffed animals for that matter.

My Pitbull.

I can post my cat pics here and there are still protections that will prevent me from losing everything.

I understand that there are precautions I can take. Put the stuffed animals on a high shelf, Yell at him and tell him ""No!"" when he tries to eat them. Spray that bitter apple stuff on everything.

None of these options make me feel comfortable enough to risk a substantial portion of my hard earned wealth on a speculative asset which has proven time and time again to be susceptible to chewing and stuffing extraction.

I desperately wanted Beanie Babies to work and I am disheartened to submit to cat pics which essentially makes me a free man to everyone but the secret evil cat society.

Hi ! Theanythingapp here !,"Hi !
I like to introduce about Theanythingapp project here !
There are few other projects that create bot type company, focusing on business that generate profit and combines multiple features to self-govern these companies. And among those, 
Theanythingapp is decentralized autonomous company with built-in rating system of a company or team members based on their actual work and results.Theanythingapp has own governance and liability fund which is used in case company 's debts or liabilities.
By combining these features we wanted to pave the path for Autonomous Agents (Bots, Robots and AI) to be able to own Theanythingapp or be part of any team and challenge developers to create internal autonomous agents that are sophisticated enough to join company teams and be rated based on their performance rather than have companies using 3rd party subscription services.
This airdrop is one of the most well done I've ever participated to...and even if I know that many users don't consider airdrops as a fundamental part in a project, in my opinion you can still understand how the team is working well even from things like these...and let me say, Theanythingapp is working in a fantastic way! Theanythingapp allows businesses to undergo expansion in a decentralized manner in the ever competitive market, keeping in pace with Good Project !
Theanythingapp is a designed site for customers to earn through their skills and monetize their achievements for every transaction.
It is essential web to target visitors. Potentially specific leads for their product or extend themselves into the community via Theanythingapp .
Theanythingapp is a growing community in crypto currency. It's not a bad idea to invest here. So what are you waiting for, invest now. Theanything 's community is waiting for you.
I like this project more and more! I hope that the project will be interested in large investment funds. Excellence !",1524401560,22/04/2018 12:52:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8e31v2/hi_theanythingapp_here/,0

Can we talk about Blocklimit/weight/size and other hardforks.. again?,"I think it's kind of sad, that the whole debate seems to be non-existent now.

Bitcoin was meant to be a **decentralized cash** system.

Without being **decentralized** it adds no new value compared to existing systems.
Without being **cash** it adds no new value compared to existing systems.

On-chain scaling is not enough to scale, that's why thankfully LN has been brought to BTC.
Off-chain scaling is not enough to scale, that's why BTC will need some sort of on-chain scaling.

So how do we move on from here? I think the NY agreement caused a lot of damage even though it failed. Not only because it has been an political attempt to take over the network, but because it led to the end of the on-chain scaling discussion. The community was against S2x because it has been an attempt to fire the core devs and not because the community was against an blocksize/weight increase per se.

Is there any info on the current stance of core devs, miners, users, businesses? 

Imo, we really should discuss more how future updates can be done.",1524404775,22/04/2018 13:46:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8e3bn7/can_we_talk_about_blocklimitweightsize_and_other/,0

"Old investor know this saying: Buy at the sound of the cannon, sell at the sound of the bell","It’s difficult to go against your instinct and buy when everyone is saying things are doomed, outlook is bad, there is no future etc (the sound of the cannon). 
And it’s difficult to sell when everyone says things are great, it’s going to the moon, outlook is wonderful, TA indicates upswing coming etc (the sound of the bell). 
And that’s why a lot of people lose money, to allow a few people to make A LOT of it. 
This applies to ANY investment, but more so to an investment where sentiment plays a big part of intraday and short term swings.

Is a Raspberry Pi 3 with a pruned node beneficial to the network?,"I have a Raspberry Pi 3 sitting around not doing much and am currently building bitcoin 0.16.0 on it. I started setting up my bitcoin.conf when I learned about the prune option. I also realized that I only have 119G available on my SD card and it looks like the blockchain is currently ~155.2G. Should I continue setting up my node as a pruned node or is it pointless?


I want to run a node to support the community, and not just to benefit myself or to support my own wallet. I stumbled across some forum posts from last year saying a pruned node does not help the network because it does not receive incoming connections like a full node. Is this still true?

Could bitcoin power the stock exchange?,"
I’ve been running some figures and the chatter of $100k bitcoin seems just a little too implausible.

For that to happen it would need to more than double Apple’s current market cap ($841BN) 

I love crypto that to me that just seems a step too far, unless it can be used for something *incredibly* valuable.

It got me thinking..

Ten years down the line does anyone see a possibility that the NYSE could be run entirely on crypto.

Shares traded via lightening / smart contracts with bitcoin as the underlying ‘security’? 

If this were possible and were to come to fruition, I could see every reason why we’d have a market cap many multiples of Apple and the most valuable piece of tech in the world..at 100k to 300k per coin minimum.

Would this ever be possible?",1524415032,22/04/2018 16:37:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8e4dof/could_bitcoin_power_the_stock_exchange/,1

It's over.,"Ok, so I've been keeping an eye on Bitcoin and it seems to me that it's over.

Bitcoin's mission is complete. It has given the world a gift and now the world is evolving it.

Go onto Google Trends and search: ""Bitcoin"" 

You'll see newbies have disappeared. Also, have a look at the daily transaction numbers. Not been operating at such a daily low consistently since 2015. 

I've researched hard, and the best project I can find is called Kin. So, if you're looking to make money, you won't be finding any golden eggs from now on in Bitcoin.

WARNING : A Difficult Question For Bitcoin Hodlers ?,"Proof of Work promotes increased fossil sourced electricity use. Fossil fuel is causing the collapse in the global food chain through climate collapse. No food = human extinction = Bitcoin valuation collapsing. 

On the horizon we will have $trillions of fossil fuel assets stranded, since our protection mechanism against mass starvation should be outlawing fossil fuel usage. Wastage of limited electricity will be frowned on, alongside electricity costs would be expected to spike. 

In this type of scenario, Hodler, how would you defend your longterm position of siding with the best Proof of Work project around over the best potential Proof of Stake project?

Nodes that don't play nicely together,"I got stuck with the task of setting up a node for that 'other coin' on the same server as bitcoin....jeez, what a mess.

Firstly, the binaries have the same name as bitcoin so as anyone doing a copy/paste install will screwup their existing node.

Secondly, it uses the same port numbers as bitcoin so you have to force one to change with some extra config.

Thirdly, it uses the same data directory as bitcoin by default - which is just silly as it can shit on (or access) the existing setup.

These are such basic things &amp; IMHO its deliberate to screw with BTC. I cant consider their node trustworthy, it certainly 'does not play well with others'.

Reason for posting this here - attempting to install the 'other node' will probably kill your btc install, so best if you dont!

Was scammed 48.4 BTC off of OTC Traders itbit,"My Bitcoin address is 1FfkeAPwZDNVdRsURJokK9VmCQH4Y1M4qY
I sent 48.4 BTC to the OTC traders at itbit at 544eaff0d1dd0c1c91c84857d210af47d10b1fac1b5e27635d8ca25ef477ee18
It opened up a site where we chatted and he said he would give me market value at 9,000 USD. I sent it to the address and he told me to wait one confirmation. After the site did not load up and said that Connection Refused and now I cannot get on. 

If someone from itBit is here can you please verify that you are still doing the trade or was I scammed? I am getting lawyers ready right now so it is best you respond.
Authorities will be involved if this is not resolved in 24 hours

What are your political views on Bitcoin?,"I know many of you are libertarians, but I was wondering how other ideologies are dealing with cryptocurrencies.

Personally, I am a left\-wing libertarian that believes that banks and corporations shouldn’t be able to control the economy the way they do now. That’s why I support cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular.

Also, if there is more than one political opinion in the comments \(very likely\), let’s just be respectful! I love a good political debate and I’m sure many of you do too.",1524461376,23/04/2018 05:29:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8e95tn/what_are_your_political_views_on_bitcoin/,1

What If...,"We have all heard of bitcoin as a 'store of value', right? Have you ever pondered the notion of a cosmic or terrestrial event that would render our current digital infrastructure defunct? As a result, our holdings would be valueless, and hoarding physical assets like land and metals would be more popular than ever. I simply opine, however improbable said event may be, to not rely on the digital too much. I mean, we have less than a century's data on what could impact our computer systems most, since we've only had these systems for that long.

Can we get a sticky in this sub that is constantly updated for stores accepting Lightning payments?,"I think this is a really good idea. Stores will be encouraged to begin accepting it early on to be as high up on this list as possible. It also encourages posters to set up their lightning wallets when they have a clear and regularly updated list of places where it can be used.

It also will help dispel the myth once and for all that we as a community do not see Bitcoin as a store of value *and* a future global currency.

Our main focus right now is progressing this technology, we have all the new apps from Blockstream we have the Eclair wallet, the Lightning Network space is fast developing - but the culmination of **all** of this work is the growing number of stores accepting it. Lets give them some exposure and highlight adoption as a priority.

How not to make mistakes during trading!,"Hi Everyone! 
Just wanted to share my experience in trading so far with you, so the newcomers might benefit from it. I started trading since early November, was right in time when btc had its crazy rally. I managed to quadruple my investment , but being a newbie I thought this will go up forever with a slight down movements. As you had all already noticed, we made it back to 6k-6.5k :) I was so desperate to make quick profits in a down market that I decided to play all in game. All based on news, tech analysis (not that often). This were the days , where I was down from my initial investment, and did not know what to do (I invested quite a lot). I would check my portfolio every 10 mins during the day, and few times during the night. I could not sleep, and thought was going crazy about it.
Back to all in game: so I made some all ins, and was successful but the could not exit on time! I mean, I could but I was reentering the same exact coin few times in retracements! Alert: Try no to do that, if you are not a pro!!! This happened coz I thought every time that I could earn more , why sell now .. i was chasing 0.3-0.5 btcs when already made 3-4 btcs; at the end , I ended up with -1 btc. Pretty sad. 

Now I am far from my initial investment, but I managed to calm myself, as I am pretty sure things will get back to its places (I mean my numbers in portfolio :) ). So take precautions, please. Try not to let you emotions overtake you. 

Hope this helps :) ",1524467535,23/04/2018 07:12:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8e9mfw/how_not_to_make_mistakes_during_trading/,4

Does anybody know how we can get a list of lightning network enabled bitcoin wallets listed on the lightning network map website?,"Hi all, 

The website I mean is this one: https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/ 

The two existing wallets that I am aware of are eclair and coinOS.io

I am curious if anybody knows how we can get those wallets and any other lightning enabled bitcoin wallets listed on that website??

The reason I want this to happen is because I think functional and easy to use lightning enabled bitcoin wallets are just as important as more channels and more capacity on the lightning network. This really can't come soon enough. The world is waiting to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange, and not just a store of value. I am very keen on bitcoin as is, but I am even more keen on bitcoin if I can use it to buy things. :)

Thoughts? How can we see the current list of lightning enabled bitcoin wallets in a central place like that map?",1524469351,23/04/2018 07:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8e9r4l/does_anybody_know_how_we_can_get_a_list_of/,4

How to restructure blockchain data?,"Hey I am doing some research and 
I need to restructure the bitcoin blockchain into a graph, such that each address ever registered in the blockchain would be given a point on the graph. Each point/address is   connected to other points by the value of the transactions sent/recieved from other points.

I made a small sketch to explain the idea:
https://imgur.com/gallery/w1MK6zN

So I am worried that searching over the entire blockchain of 500,000ish blocks and then searching for all transactions containing address X is going to need around a prohibitively high amount of time:

searching through
(chain height * avg transactions per chain)
for
(total number of addresses)

Assuming traversing the blockchain takes 5 minutes (Optimistic Number) and there are a million addresses on the blockchain (numbers out of my ass) 
5 min * 1 million = 5 million minutes which is about 9 Years !! 

So do you know of a better way I can query the blockchain for all transactions of each address  ?",1524479108,23/04/2018 10:25:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eaff8/how_to_restructure_blockchain_data/,2

STATE SUPPORTED MINING - 0.04 - 0.055USD/KWh,"Since this year January, we are working on a project in cooperation with the Moldovan government (Transnistrian Autonomous Region) to sell their excess electricity to large scale miners. As some of you guys know (https://eadaily.com/en/news/2018/02/02/transnistria-legalizes-cryptocurrency-and-waiting-for-investors), in Transnistria they passed a law at the end of January, which legalizes and supports blockchain related activities, including setting up exchanges or running mining facilities.

The law lists several incentives for companies in the cryptoindustry:

- tax-free mining operation
- zero import duty on mining-related hardware
- visa free stay for employees
- support to build the appropriate facilities, if needed
- rent-free use of existing buildings for mining operation


Our company, MS-DB Energy (http://wepowercrypto.io/) is a licensed company tasked to sell excess electricity to miners up to 15 GW.

Currently we are finalizing pricing, the legal documents including warranties for miners, the terms&amp;conditions, and uploading power plant images+parameters, and available building images for hosting mining operation.

The project is near to kickstart and feel free to contact us if you are interested or you like to work with us. In the following weeks we plan to start promoting the project via press releases, display ads and present the project to the whole community and of course to the heavy hitters in the mining industry.

We have some docs uploaded, feel free to check it out: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0bnl2d7sgy4jjnp/AABlwkGAIzg3pU3gIvJ3FUcaa?dl=0

"Foreigner in the USA, buying $$$ with bitcoin?","So, I'll be spending a month in the USA, backpacking about and being a tourist (excited!). My home bank accounts are in euros and swiss francs. The banks here charge big fees to use credit and debit cards in the US, both at ATMs and point-of-sale, with poor exchange rates, so over a month I'm going to spend far too much in international tx fees. I'm also doing a camper/road trip thing so don't want to carry a ton of USD in cash.

I'm part funding the trip with bitcoin gainz (woop woop), and it seems crazy to convert that to fiat in order to move it between international banks. Kind of goes against the point of bitcoin, no?

So looking for convenient ways to buy USD with bitcoin as a foreigner in the US. Any advice for an America noob? Selling for cash $ on localbitcoins while I'm there? How about bitcoin ATM's, anyone used them to withdraw US$ for reasonable fees?

I'm determined to do it this way on principle, I've spent a lot of time trading bitcoin and not much spending/using it, so now I'd like to take advantage of it as a decentralised global currency, and not give my bank a slice of every tx I make over there... 

(Lastly, and sorry if this is too close to markets/price talk, just wondering if it's cool to access my legitimately not-American bitmex and bitfinex accounts while in the US, or am I better off staying away from them?)",1524481912,23/04/2018 11:11:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eanfy/foreigner_in_the_usa_buying_with_bitcoin/,4

To BAN or not to BAN,"The government can ban Bitcoin not only because the crypto currency is used for illegal activities and with criminal intentions. The main reason for Bitcoin's ban could be the government's lack of confidence in its own power and the inability to regulate the crypto-currency sphere. Bitcoin is decentralized and is not regulated by the government, so it can become uncontrollable and present a danger to the state. It is for this reason that many governments are considering the option of banning digital money.",1524482472,23/04/2018 11:21:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eap6c/to_ban_or_not_to_ban/,0

Be extra careful when using the Coinomi wallet [x-post from /r/BitcoinPrivate],"I have been using the Coinomi wallet for the last month or so and it has worked great.

The app worked fine earlier in the day and there had been no changes made to my mobile phone via app installs, etc. I kept receiving the following error when trying to open the application: https://imgur.com/cP1U3El

I rebooted the phone, force closed the application, cleared the cache, nothing fixed the issue. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Without the recovery phrase I would have been screwed.

They should be verifyable for all other nodes in the network. So there should be a sender private key, that signs that transaction at every transaction. But at the genesis block and the miner reward transactions, there is no sender at all(from what I know).

PSA : Addressing fraud and misinformation about Bitcoin,"I'm sure everyone is aware of a website and a twitter handle in the name of Bitcoin which is fraudulently shilling a coin owned by the wannabe Chairman Mao of cryptocurrency as 'the real Bitcoin'.

Well, not quite everyone and that's really the problem. It stands to reason that people who're new to Bitcoin may easily fall prey to these shill-mongers.

We can't just turn a blind eye and say let's just worry about Bitcoin because this is about Bitcoin. Imagine Amazon.com or @Amazon being used by an imposter to promote a fake company. How long would that last?

It's also important because this counterfeit would have zero value if it weren't allowed to plagiarize the name of Bitcoin.

Although not in favor of minority forks which take on the Bitcoin name, at least the other minority forks of Bitcoin don't pretend to be Bitcoin.

In the interest of protecting new, uninitiated, vulnerable members of the community, I request that everyone report both the Twitter handle and the website.

Bitcoin Market Prices / SEC Futures / Manipulation,"With all the recent talk about big money starting to trade OTC for bitcoin a lot of thoughts start to come to mind. Specifically when considering that these OTC markets are supposedly set up for high networth individuals as to not influence the normal market (lol). I mean WTF does that even mean? From where I sit it means that big money can load up on bitcoin while leaving the markets that normal networth people use unchanged. This is not a free market IMO!  I mean I'm sure that there are pieces of this puzzle that I'm missing but here's the scenario as I see it today :

Big money finally understands and accepts bitcoin is the future and wants in. They also want to be able to control price as much as possible. In order to do so they create futures products on the CME, CBOE, and soon to be NASDAQ. All of these are regulated by the SEC. Ironically the bitcoin markets themselves are not.  Enter OTC markets. Now, while all of the normal people are using the typical Coinbase, GDAXs, kraken etc , they want to buy and sell in a good old boy network that average people are financially locked out of. Worse yet is that these large block trades that would have originally been forced onto the GDAXs Krakens etc are now completely offline and don't move the prices at all! To top it off they try to sell this to the masses as a good thing!  This is not a good thing IMO. The big money is pouring in billions of dollars and the value of Bitcoin as seen on the exchanges is barely budging. Furthermore now that they have federally regulated futures products there's nothing stopping them from simply placing huge sell orders with these OTC bought coins on the GDAXs of the world and causing a plunge in the price of bitcoin.  I really hope someone can show me how I'm wrong here but I do not think futures or OTC are a good thing at all here.",1524501785,23/04/2018 16:43:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ecvku/bitcoin_market_prices_sec_futures_manipulation/,0

3. Go shopping.
4. Buy something.
5. Take QR\-Photo.
6. Click on send.
7. Payment will be send in 1\-3 seconds. 

Other issues need to be done implicitly. The user cannot create node and do other stuff on his own because it will be to complicated for mainstream.

I want to see marijuana backed by Bitcoin, it's perfect for the climate of impending decriminalization around the world.

BTC rich-list monitoring tool,"Hello everyone, because lately we talk a lot about the manipulation of the price of cryptos, I write to share with you a tool on which I have been working for a while that aims to track the movements (buy/sell) of TOP 200 richest BTC addresses (20%+ of totale BTC share!!!) believing that they can have privileged information unlike us ""poor kittens"".

I started to record what happens on a daily basis for about 2 weeks and it started providing some interesting data, but I don't want to condition your opinion and set up a conversation all together.

The tool can be downloaded at this address: https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6w01p44b9axqpu/BTC%20Monitoring%20Tool%20-%20v14.xlsm?dl=0

Important: you will find 2 buttons to start the macros contained in the worksheet, to update the data in real time press ""Refresh data"" and wait for the completion of the query. Then you can record collected data by pressing ""Add record"".

I hope it can be useful for everybody, comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome",1524509384,23/04/2018 18:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8edw1d/btc_richlist_monitoring_tool/,6

Altcoins are an attack on bitcoin,"And bitcoin DGAF.  

Let's be real.  Altcoins are crap.  They have no use case as they are all centralized.  Only bitcoin is truly decentralized.  

The way the altcoins pump all in unison is not a coincidence.  This is to entice n00bz into investing their energy into these centralized altcoins and to gain their trust that way.  The old world order wants to keep control and they are trying to distort the revolution/evolution of money into centralized altcoins which is just the same as centralized fiat.  Be wary.  

They will talk crap about bitcoin saying it's old and slow and outdated.  This is typical n00b talk I see a lot from altcoiners.  They will comment in droves on this post talking crap even though we're in a bitcoin reddit.  This is a very coordinated attack folks, both by the powers that were, and their unknowning minions.

Bitcoin is going to take us all by surprise!,"Bitcoin is not a company wherein its value goes to the owners or share holders like facebook for example. Everyone who participates gets rewarded as it grows.

We are what give facebook value but we dont see any gains..

What if facebook was more like bitcoin. If you used it early on you got rewarded. The earlier you got in and the more you used it the more reward you obtained. Would that have made it more popular or less popular during its early days??

One thing is for sure if the gains that went to the early investors and Mark Zuckerberg went to the users instead, everyone would have been calling it a financial fraud. ""Free money? Must be a scam"".. Sound familiar?

Im thinking along the lines that if facebook rewarded users, a few people who understood how it worked would have used it and benefited greatly, but most would have avoided it out of fear of consequence of participating in financial fraud, or something otger people thought criminals used etc. However over time once people realised that it was all good and legal they would have flocked to it enmasse!

This is the same as bitcoin. A few early users who understand how it works benefit. Meanwhile everyone else stays away out of fear of consequence, until one day they wake up and realise ""hey this is actually a legit thing that even big financial guys are into. Im gonna get in too."" At at point within a period of 12 months everyone jumps in.

We are not at that point yet but it is coming soon, and when it hits it will happen faster than anyone could have imagined.",1524528604,24/04/2018 00:10:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eg8ev/bitcoin_is_going_to_take_us_all_by_surprise/,9

We have 800k subscriber on this sub and that's enough to get most companies to accept bitcoin, so why aren't we pushing them too?

With prices rising again there will be interest from newcomers. This is a quick guide for the newcomers of how to recognize the social attacks against Bitcoin.,"There is a lot of misinformation being spread to confuse people new to Bitcoin and take their money.  The chatter about Bitcoin over the past few days has a positive feel and people are getting excited that prices might jump up again.  People that take advantage of the less informed are also ramping up the misinformation to try to confuse people.  The current attacks come from Bitcoin Cash, which is an unpopular fork from Bitcoin.

Be aware that a few people that control Bitcoin Cash have delusions that they can take over the Bitcoin name.  Various websites, twitter accounts and such claim to be Bitcoin when they are really promoting Bitcoin Cash.  If you want to buy Bitcoin, make sure you are buying Bitcoin (ticker BTC) and not Bitcoin Cash (ticker BCH).  If you see someone say Bitcoin Core or BCore, they are certainly trying to confuse you.  Bitcoin Core is software that runs Bitcoin while Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

You might hear things like Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, or scaling is not really a problem, or core developers are being controlled by a corporation, or whatever.  Bitcoin by its very definition is the blockchain with the most proof of work (computing power spent) to secure the chain of transactions that starting in 2009.  Anyone who tells you something different is trying to take your money and/or damage Bitcoin.  Since the Bitcoin Cash fork in August 2017, Bitcoin has added 8-10 times the amount of proof of work compared to Bitcoin Cash.  This means that Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is a long way from being able to catch up.

Please understand that there was a large battle over how Bitcoin would scale to handle millions of users.  Bitcoin chose to not scale for a while to force development of second layer transactions that are ultimately summarized and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.  This was done with the knowledge that Bitcoin would suffer for a short while.  Once second layer transactions are fully working and easy to use by millions, Bitcoin will offer the most distributed, most secure, nearly instant, and also inexpensive form of cryptocurrency payment.  It is critical to note that even after second layer scaling is fully matured on Bitcoin, you can still choose to make the old fashioned Bitcoin transactions if you want.  Second layer scaling is completely optional so I’m not sure why Bitcoin Cash supporters get angered about people choosing to scale this way.

Bitcoin Cash chose to increase the internet bandwidth and storage requirements that are needed to support millions of users on the blockchain.  There is no way around the fact that millions of users on the blockchain will cause centralization.  Governments will be able to control the limited number of people/corporations that can record all transactions from all around the globe.  If this centralization occurred, it breaks the fundamental decentralized part of Bitcoin and Bitcoin will be replaced by another cryptocurrency.  In the event that second layer transactions fail on Bitcoin and Bitcoin is not able to scale, Bitcoin Cash will also fail as it has no way to scale that the crypto world will accept.

Another fundamental of Bitcoin is that miners will behave in a way that is best for them.  Bitmain controls an unhealthy amount of computing power and could attack the Bitcoin blockchain.  This would destroy the trustless part of Bitcoin and users would flee to other cryptocurrencies.  Bitmain knows that this would also kill Bitcoin Cash since it uses the same computing hardware.  Basically, Bitmain would hold millions (billions?) of dollars worth of hardware that would then be useless since users will not put value in cryptocurrencies Bitmain can use its hardware for.  So Bitmain cannot attack Bitcoin without killing themselves also.

I’m a bit disappointed by the latest pump of BCH prices.  They forgot to spam the mempool and slow down transactions.  Maybe they figured out that only makes Bitcoin stronger because the fees go up which then pays miners to mine more Bitcoin.  The pump certainly has the supporters chanting that they are taking over Bitcoin even when the Bitcoin Cash value is one seventh that of Bitcoin.  Time is running out for Bitcoin Cash as second layer scaling is beginning to work on Bitcoin and that will be the final nail in Bitcoin Cash’s coffin.

To anyone posting random celebrities claiming bitcoin will reach 1 billion/2 cents $ value..,"Anyone here thinks Bitcoin (and other cryptos, except scamcoins) are here to stay, and i'm totally one of you.

But i simply do not trust random people making claims without explain why they may or may not be rapresentative of the future.

Anyone here should do their own research.

For example IMO a good prevision of where market is going may be:

Assimung in the next years, Y people, have invested Z$ in cryptos in average, total market cap will be Y*Z$ greater than now.

Assuming bitcoin will still have 40% market cap in cryptos, bitcoin price will be: (current market cap + Y*Z*0.4)/(total number of bitcoins mined to that day)

Obviously this is an estimation, but far more accurate than random people claiming stuff, because this is YOUR prediction.

Severe risks of ignoring framing &amp; social manipulation,"Long time listener, first time caller.

At the time of last year's fork, it was painfully clear what the intention behind naming the contentious chain ""Bitcoin Cash"" were - these intentions were to profit off a well-known name, to gain instant renown without years of struggle. This is a normal corporate behaviour when acquiring companies and changing the products in all but nominal ways.

Where the difference lies, however, from the usual attempt to piggyback on a bigger name, is in the ingenious framing the issue from very get-go: through creating a new label of ""Bitcoin Cash"" and constantly naming the non-contentious chain ""Bitcoin Core"", the ground was set for an ideological framing based on false equivalency. These two names were now slowly pushed to cultivate a narrative of two chains with equal stake to the name ""Bitcoin"". 

""So what"" you might say, ""bcash btrash, everyone can tell.""

Well, no. Not everyone can tell. People are idiots voting power-hungry megalomaniacs into power all the time.

We're now at the point where the next phase of ideological framing is happening:
There is an increasing number of mentions of Bitcoin being called BCore (a mirror of BCash name-calling from last year obviously) and more alarmingly calling Bitcoin Cash, the Bitcoin. Some sites owned by BCH proponents now call BCH Bitcoin, and BTC Bitcoin Core, effectively finalising the long-term plan of first creating an illusion of equivalent right to a name, to then usurp it for good.


Complacency is dangerous. Letting this happen and waving it away by saying anyone outside can see the truth (whatever it is) is ignorant. History is written by victors. The reality of how the events unfolded doesn't matter if the opposite is repeated enough. We've got Holocaust deniers already, and it's only been half a century ago since the deplorable acts caused so much harm.

This is not time for name-calling, for dismissal, for trolling and getting precious time wasted in childish comment battles.
 This is time for constructive action, for not allowing for the social manipulation to go any further, for putting as much effort into perception management as is put into the technology - mass adoption requires that.

TL/DR:
- We started with Bitcoin the original and only vs Bcash the terrible name-grab attempt.
- We then heard of this unicorn, Bitcoin Core vs. brave new Bitcoin Cash maintaining the vision of whoever the deity is
- At last, we now hear more of BCore (BTC) vs. Bitcoin (BCH) - the final stage in usurping the good name.

This shit ain't good. Need to stop it.",1524558327,24/04/2018 08:25:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eivep/severe_risks_of_ignoring_framing_social/,3

What’s your idea about the rise of bitcoin demand?,"[Bitcoin trading](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/) have surpassed 90% of the total trading volume in cryptocurrency exchanges. According to the data from TurtleBC, the demand of bitcoin is more than its supply. Although it began to decline continuously after setting a record of $20000 in December last year, it is never demanded by so many investors.



People’s interest in buying cryptocurrency is reflected on the data, which seems to prove the financial celebrities’ opinion: the market will recover soon. Saxo Bank is always optimistic about bitcoins. Jacob Pouncey, the analyst in the bank predicted that the second quarter of 2018 will be the beginning of bull market. The founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee is also optimistic about bitcoin and forecast that [bitcoin price](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-climbs-40-day-high-9200/) will achieve $25000 before the end of this year. Besides, after analyzing the habit of [bitcoin trading](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/), Unchained Capital found that the rate of selling bitcoin achieves 58%. 



I think the rise of bitcoin demand reflects that bitcoin is developing well. Although we cannot predict the trend absolutely, we can be optimistic about it. What’s your idea?

Lightning Network for-profit question.,"I really like the idea behind Lightning Network but I also have a few problems imagining it.

I know that the idea is to have as many users connected to each other as possible to create a distributed mesh but I believe that it will not happen, I believe that hubs will happen and that it's unavoidable.

The fact is that they hubs need to have a large quantity of Bitcoin if they want to run with a lot of users and that's where my mind breaks.

Why would anyone run such a node with high liquidity since the price of Bitcoin is so volatile, the only reason I could imagine is that they will make money.

If they are going to be making money, how profitable is it then? Because to me, it doesn't seem that profitable since transactions on the Lightning Network are so cheap.

For Lightning network to start scaling (To get more nodes and more users on it) large hubs would need to open.
I imagine companies start to do that and require a monthly fee to keep the channel open. (That's at least what I would do if users were willing to pay)

What are your thoughts about this?",1524575177,24/04/2018 13:06:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ek8qx/lightning_network_forprofit_question/,1

George Soros called cryptocurrencies a bubble in January. Now his $26 billion family office is planning to trade digital assets.

Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at New York\-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade virtual coins in the last few months, though he has yet to make a wager, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman declined to comment.

Soros, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said digital coins cannot function as actual currencies because of their volatility.

What if I told you. That are not the creator of Bitcoin?,"And that you simply just imagining everything. Is there some sort of great data filter as a result of the technology behind Bitcoin that prevents digital consensus? Who knows but if you’re reading this article, then you probably know more about Bitcoin that you could possibly imagine. Yes you my friend, you are not Satoshi Nakamoto. (Even if you are thinking you are) 

And if this post has made any sense to you.  You’ve taken too much drugs obviously but, I suggest you independently take a closer look at the technology and how much trouble it is causing. Your digital livelihoods could be at stake.

QuadrigaCX (Canadian Exchange) experiencing numerous issues with banks in Canada,"I've been waiting for a withdrawal to come through for some time now. Here is the response I received from Quadriga when I submitted a ticket:

&gt;Over the past months, we have faced numerous issues with banks in Canada blocking both internal and external transfers due to their dislike of Bitcoin. We have been working diligently to establish new banking relationships with credit unions and smaller banks to eliminate the issues caused primarily by CIBC and RBC. We are currently limited in the volume that we are permitted to send each day, therefore withdrawal times vary.
Please note the following updates:
All withdrawals marked complete on or prior to March 28th should now be in your account. If they are not, please contact us.
If your withdrawal was marked complete on March 29th, there is a very good chance that it should now have arrived (Of over 3000 payments marked complete on this day, all but 50 should now have arrived), although it may not arrive until Wednesday. If it has not arrived by Wednesday, please contact us regarding it.
If your withdrawal is currently pending, it will be processed as soon as possible and we currently project that it will arrive prior to the end of next week. This however is an estimate that may change based on various factors. If you are in a hurry, you can cancel pending withdrawals at anytime and instantly withdraw crypto.
Over the last 24 hours, we have sent millions of dollars worth of fiat withdrawals that we expect to arrive within the next 48 hrs. We continue to strive to return our Canadian dollar withdrawal timeframes to normal, however with the state of banking in Canada, it is possible that it will become a perpetual challenge. While our main competitors have now raised fees on all fiat withdrawals (eliminating all free options), we continue to be the only exchange in Canada that offers users a free cashout option. We have no plans to change this at this time.
Further to this, we would also like to remind that:
These delays only impact EFT and wire transfers of CAD fiat
Cash withdrawals are not impacted
Crypto withdrawals are not impacted
Crypto Capital withdrawals are not impacted


This is not the first time this has happened in Canada. Both Circle and Coinbase used to allow Canadian deposits and withdrawals, but both had to stop them due to their Canadian counterparts closing down. This is an issue in Canada, and it's absolutely disgusting how the banks operate. I'm not sure what to do, but this just makes me so upset. This has been under the radar for too long. **Contrary to what you might think, Canada is not friendly to crypto.**

Edit: I also suspect, this is why there are so few exchanges in Canada.",1524581580,24/04/2018 14:53:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ekzu4/quadrigacx_canadian_exchange_experiencing/,1

"The ""Bitcoin Foundation"", a supposedly community driven bitcoin advocacy group, has now been taken over by 'Bitcoin Cash' supporters","I just received an email from the 'Bitcoin Foundation' this morning, written by a man named 'Llew Clasen'.

Llew Clasen is Vinny Lingham's business partner at Newtown Ventures. Vinny, of course, supports BCH and thinks Bitcoin is failing. 

The 'Bitcoin Foundation' has a substantial budget and a mandate to promote bitcoin in a positive light and to advocate for it with government regulators.

However, it has now been taken over by bcash supporters.

Roger Ver now controls numerous media outlets and is spending a huge amount of money spreading the lie that bitcoin cash 'is the real bitcoin'.

Meanwhile, bitcoin itself has a PR budget of exactly zero dollars and zero cents.  Other than guys like us posting on social media, that's it. 

The damage being done by this social engineering and media attack is not insignificant.  People who are thought leaders within the community should stop sitting on the sidelines, and make a concerted effort to correct the lies, fraud, and propaganda being spread by Roger Ver and his supporters.

He owns bitcoin.com, the bitcoin twitter account, now the bitcoin foundation, there is no end to his willingness to socially engineer a PR campaign to spread lies and disinformation.

Here is the complete text of the email that was blasted out this morning:

------------------------------------------------------

Dear John,

A warm welcome to our new members. Every month, I send out an operational update to all members and highlight key operational issues arising since the last members’ update.
 
Here are our operational highlights for March 2018:
 
The Foundation’s 2018/19 planning
Much of the Foundation's activities in March revolved around planning for 2018/19. The Executive Director (ED) and Chairman of the Board prepared a financial, marketing and operating plan to commit $5 million to scale up the operations of the Foundation and to take a more prominent role as an advocacy organization in the industry.
 
This plan was presented to potential backers in San Francisco, the board and also to the members of the Foundation during a webinar on April 9. It was well received all around. Thank you to all our members who attended the webinar and so actively engaged in the Q&amp;A session.  

Marketing and Operations plan 2018
Financial reports and projections 2017/2018
Speaking engagement, Bitcoin Cash conference, Satoshi’s Vision
The Foundation’s ED attended the Bitcoin Cash conference, Satoshi’s Vision, in Japan March 23-25. The primary intention was to better understand how this project was evolving, meet with stakeholders and better understand how the Foundation should engage with this project going forward.
 
Our plans for 2018 and meetings at Satoshi’s Vision suggest that the Foundation has an opportunity to continue to represent the interests of an industry under siege even if there is disagreement on approach between projects.
 
Lobbying
The Foundation continues to engage with lawmakers in New York state and Washington DC to influence both state and federal legislation in a way that is fundamentally positive for the industry. We expect to be able to make a few announcements on progress shortly.
 
BlockShow Europe 2018, Berlin, Germany (May 28-29)
BlockShow Europe 2018 is an event that brings together the global Blockchain community. The Foundation’s ED will be speaking and we look forward to participating. We have a special promotional offer of 25% off for our members. Use code: 25BITCOINFOUNDATION when buying tickets.
 
WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018, Vienna, Austria (May 16-18)
WeAreDevelopers brings together developers from across the world to share their knowledge and experience. Dubbed “The Woodstock of Developers” this year’s event focuses on current tech trends including Blockchain. We have a special offer of 25% off for our members. Use code: BITCOIN-FOUNDATION25 when buying tickets.  
 
Member Telegram group
If you haven’t already,  join the Foundation and fellow members in our new Telegram group.  
 
The Foundation's financial position 
March’s revenue included membership contributions of $2,001. There were 13 new members. Operating expenses for the period were $7,588 which is higher than usual. Some of the larger expenses this month included flights for the Foundations ED to San Francisco to meet with the chairman of the board to discuss plans for 2018 and meeting with potential funders ($2,455) and professional fees for marketing and accounting services, especially 2018 planning ($2,829). The net operating deficit for the period was $6,192.
 
March’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) high was $11,480 with a low of $6,844. Total cash assets including BTC and USD were $5,467 at 03/31/18.
 
The Foundation's income statement and balance sheet are available to members for download.

We appreciate your continued support. 

Yours in the service of Bitcoin,

"It's taken me 8 months, but I finally own 1 Bitcoin!","My foray into Bitcoin began back in August of 2017. 
By September, I had a little over .43 Bitcoin but I sold it at a slight loss because of the China ban FUD. I used that money for projects on the house instead of buying back in. 
(I thought 4.7k was the top and that Bitcoin would just get cheaper)

My next purchase was at the end of October when I FOMOed back in. I continued to DCA and buy Bitcoin periodically each month all the way up and down. 

Like most folks, I was up significantly in Dec/ early Jan and watched as my unrealized profits melted away. (You won't fool me again! I've already learned from the first time I sold!) 

Yeah, but I'm a dumbass. On Feb 5th, I was home sick from work when I saw the price in free fall. Losing ""profits"" is a whole hell of a lot different than when you start ""losing"" your hard earned money. 

@ $6,600 I sold what I had, thinking I would be able to buy more at a lower price. I was right, but I underestimated the time it would take to recover. I took a nap and I didn't put in any buy orders. By the time I woke up we were over 7k. I finally FOMOed back in 2 days later and lost .1 BTC in the process.

But! Today I'm happy to announce that I finally own 1 whole Bitcoin. I'm in the 21 Million club! 

I believe Bitcoin

* Is a good storage of value not controlled by banks or Government
* Has the potential to become revolutionary to how we view and exchange money
* Is a good hedge bet against the current monetary system

But I can't tell folks I know so I may as well tell a bunch of strangers who would never do anything to try and steal it from me or harm me in any way, right?",1524586824,24/04/2018 16:20:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eloil/its_taken_me_8_months_but_i_finally_own_1_bitcoin/,8

I want to start mining bitcoin.,"Context:
I'm a 14 year old guy from the UK, at the moment im a bit broke and I'm looking for a way to make extra cash.
I have a low spec laptop so I dont really know if I can.

But anyway, what program should I use? How do I now redeem the bitcoins and transfer the money to my paypal? Do I have to sell the actual bitcoins?

I would let my laptop run when I'm at school so I can earn up some cash.

I also heard that there will be hardware degradation happening, how bad is this? And how much money could I make by letting my laptop run for 6 hours? I can post my specs if you want to.

Sorry for all the questions I'm just really new.

"WARNING: Zebpay holding funds hostage, threatens to ruin an already difficult bitcoin ease of use and disrupt adoption","tl;dr Zebpay doesn't want to return BCH erroneously sent to a Bitcoin wallet even though they can and should. They think they are untouchable.

I'll keep this rant short as I can.

I pay my employees in crypto. Some of my employees live in India and use the terrible service Zebpay as an exchange for converting crypto to fiat.

I made the mistake of sending BCH to a BTC address of one of my employees. Easy fix, no big deal right? WRONG!

Zebpay, in their smug arrogance, refuses to return the funds. I am making good on my promise to their customer service department to out them for being thieves.

Anyone who has accidentally made this mistake knows it is an easy fix. Zebpay admits they can make the fix but refuse to do so for less than a certain amount of money. At the moment the funds in question are over $300 yet they refuse to return it and are acting like major shady assholes.

I am skeptical they will do the right thing as they are showing their true colors. The joke of course is on them. You better believe no more of my employees are customers will be using zebpay. Nor should any of you. Boycott the shitty services than threaten to ruin the crypto user experience for their own.... what? laziness? Greed? Unclear but what is clear is Zebpay needs to have a reality check.

Enjoy the .2 BCH you morons at Zebpay. I promise you will lose more money than you can hope to have saved from just having done your god damn jobs.",1524592194,24/04/2018 17:49:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8emej3/warning_zebpay_holding_funds_hostage_threatens_to/,2

This might be very random but I thought maybe you guys can help. 
So I've just been accepted in an internship in a company that wants to work on digital marketing to encourage tourism to a certain country. And me being a crypto enthusiast and investor I thought there must be a way to implement blockchain technology to do that in a way. Does anyone have an idea how to implement that ? If there's a way in the first place.

my terrible experience trying to use a coinsourse atm,"I'm in denver, and there are a couple of different bitcoin atms to choose from...

so I started my day off deciding I was going to try to use a bitcoin atm...

I found one, arrived at a coinsourse atm....

first off, there is no instructions on how to use it, or video tutorial at the atm...

secondly it asks for your phone number...

I entered it, then it sends you a confirmation code via text..

I entered the code...

then it says you must set up an account first...

go to their home page to do so on my phone...

they want your name, first and last, phone number....

then they want you to scan your id, front and back, and then take a selfie...

after you scan your id, and send in your selfie, it is supposed to set up an account...

there is no phone number to call for help... only a text number, and an email...

I sent a text at 10:56 am... inquiring about their registration requirements.... I still have not received a response it's now 4:32pm...

I sent them an email, and within a couple of minutes, about 5 mins, they respond.

so here is the frustrating part... 
I was in front of the atm for over two hours trying to meet there requirements to set up an account...

I sent pictures of my id front and back, all of them are clear, legible photos...

none of them were accepted. I kept getting texts saying your account has been set up for id verification...

during the sending pictures, i got logged off multiple times, and had to keep reentering the same info over, and over again... each time having to get a new text code...

in email communication, the person told me they could not scan my barcode on my id.. to keep re taking pictures, and resubmit till I got a verification text, or an accept text.

after five f@cking hours of trying to get my photos accepted, I gave up.

in email, they told me to keep trying, to use a scanner instead of my phone... I used my phone, I took pictures with my friends phone, and I even scanned my id.

I sent in all, of the pictures, over and over again... emailed back and forth multiple times...each time they tell me it's my fault...keep resubmitting till I got an acceptance text...

well I never got an acceptance text...

in email, they said that I should keep trying, thanks for my patience, and they would waive my first fees...when it is sucessfully set up.

I emailed them back and told them they get one star... and I will be giving a bad review on reddit.

this is why they suck!!!!

there is no phone number to talk to a human.

they never texted back.

when technology failed, they should have had someone manually set up an account and verify my id.

they also take 8% per transaction.

f@ck coinsourse for wasting half of my day...

I told them they lost a customer...

tomorrow I will be attempting to buy bitcoin using their competitor in town.

Should governments account for bitcoin in their money supply or will they in the future?,"The immediate answer to the question feels like it should be a resounding ""no"" but I was thinking that if bitcoin continues to be used more and more, then would that not also increase the wealth and value being exchanged within an economy?

Warning: IRS Giving Hell!! Over Bitcoin,"If you have not yet filed your taxes or are thinking about filing in the future: beware reporting bitcoin!

First off, I was prepared for this, but my modest bitcoin gains negated any refund I had for all of 2017

Not only that but I’m now being treated like a criminal by the IRS.  I’m having to provide documentation of all my income for the last 2 years and present it in person 60 miles away.

I wish I would have not reported my bitcoin gains and dealt with the repurcussions later.  I didn’t even gain that much (maybe $4000) and it negated a $3500 refund AND is holding everything up while people act like Dwight with me on the phone.

Ugh thanks for letting me vent

What is the probability of governments across the world declaring Bitcoin as illegal?,"Looks like that is not the plan. What’s really coming is called in China 凌遲 (Lingchi) or the slow torture “by a thousand cuts”.

Here how it works in practice on the example of Malta.

Malta is often regarded by many decentralized economy enthusiasts as a safe-heaven for crypto-businesses. However, this image is mostly based upon the fact that local bureaucrats have occasionally expressed their admiration with block-chain technologies, even promising to implement them in local land or health registries. Alas, there's a notable absence of facts-checking behind this PR exercises.

Officially, digital currencies are not regulated on Malta. At the same time, the general direction, in which local financial watchdogs are aiming with crypto-regulation, is not inspiring at all. Malta's Financial Services Authority (MFSA) asks for a license from crypto-business qualified as financial institutions or payment service providers. Besides, MFSA does not allow anybody, who is not in a possession of disposable assets exceeding 750,000 EURO, to invest into cryptocurrency-based funds.

On a surface it appears that such regulations leave a lot of breathing space for small crypto-companies and regular users. Notwithstanding, Maltese banks ""in mass"" have already refused to work with firms and individuals involved with digital money. It's hard to blame them, providing that under the current European legislation all token issuers may be treated as ""payment service providers"". Not to mention that the EU monetary authorities continue to look at crypto-currencies nearly as at an exquisite form of fraud.

In February 2018, trying to skip over those controversies, Maltese office-holders put forward an ingenious scheme, which provides the newly created ""Malta Digital Innovation Authority"" with a magic power to ""certify"" crypto-platforms and ""verify"" all transactions. Nonetheless, that vividly reminds us some infamous East-European ""crypto-zone"", where block-chain inventors supposed to be thriving under the watchful eyes of special security agents.

If this shadow politic of gradually tightening a dog collar on a neck of fledgling new technological industry continues Malta is risking to joint the glorious list of technologically retarded countries, where another world famous island from Caribbean seas already occupies a leading position.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: moderately friendly;
economic climate: moderately friendly;
regions to focus: locally, EU;
industries to focus: FinTech, gaming, e-services (tourism);
major limitations: population is less than halve-a-million, high costs of running business, relative geographical isolation, growing competition;
stimulus: GDP growth rate exceeds 6%, developed infrastructure (fixed Internet penetration rate nears 80%), availability of seed and VC financing, qualified workforce, per-capita is around $25,000;
opportunities: to build FinTech and e-gaming businesses aimed at the European market.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (relatively negative).

&amp;nbsp;

* Total fee is just adding all fees together. Adjusted fee is calculating what you'd actually pay if paid in steps (left to right).

* I am usually assuming withdrawal to QuadrigaCX since they offer free bank transfer and coin deposits but a trading fee of 0.5% applies. It's usually the best value. 

* I am including premium prices in the BUY fee.

* Flexepin's assuming $250 cards. This offers the lowest Flexepin fee.


&amp;nbsp;

**CoinMama:** Does NOT offer ability to SELL. YOU HAVE to withdrawal.

**CEX.IO:** Withdrawals to visa $3.80, Mastercard is 1.2%

**Coinsquare:** Initial deposits will withhold your crypto for 3-7 days (No withdrawing to other exchanges)

**Coinsquare:** Initial max deposit of $1000. Withdrawal fee is currently about 3% (0.0025 BTC)

**CanadianBitcoins:** Premiums will vary based on market conditions. Premium on both BUY and SELL (Meaning you get money back when selling).

**localbitcoins:** Will fluctuate heavily depending on user offer. Can be as low as 0% premium/buy fee.

**Bitit:** Bitit - RISKY! = Using third party TrustPay, may not be trustworthy.

**EZBTC:** Added 1.5% to BUY fee as the order books are extremely thin. Current premium is &gt; 1.5%. Also assuming withdrawal from QuadrigaCX because again, EZBTC order book would be costing you &gt;3% to sell. Be careful here, you can easily pay extra premiums if you are buying large amounts.

Bitcoin Volatility and Capital Gains Tax,"Easy example. Let's say a person pulls out a million dollars USD from their crypto gains in the summer and stashes it in a bank \(only nibbling on it here and there\). Let's say by December it goes down to 800K after they bought a house or something. Now, instead of paying a hefty capital gains tax, they can reinvest it before the year is over in order to avoid paying the tax on that 800K. Let's say a bunch of people do this and we see a surge in cryptos late in the year. 

How much volatility, if any, is due to people reinvesting gains they had pulled out in order to skirt capital gains tax? Asking for a friend. ",1524620979,25/04/2018 01:49:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8epxax/bitcoin_volatility_and_capital_gains_tax/,1

Theres not enough Gold???,"A lot of people (economists) make the argument gold cannot work as a form of money because there is not enough of it.

This is correct for 2 reasons:

1) is prevents central banks from printing more money out of thin air.

2) for the USD as the world reserve currency, they needed to go off of the gold standard because they had created more paper money than they had gold to back it up, and when countries started repatriating their gold holdings they had to go off the gold standard to keep the dollar as the global reserve currency.

So gold cant work because it is limitied in supply, ONLY if you want a infinate amount of money to be created at will.

If you ever hear this argument understand this point that gold is good for citizens just bad for those who want to create money out of nothing.

A limited supply monetary system is only bad if you want to corrupt, manipulate and centrally plan the monetary system.

A truely decentralized monetary system,"Hey guys,
I know a lot of people are in crypto for the money but there are also those who strongly believe that crypto currencies could be in fact an alternative to our current centralized monetary system which works through central banks.
My personal challenge is that I am not able to find any serious proposal how this would actually work. Without a doubt you cannot replace the central banks just like that with - let´s say Bitcoin or any other crypto currency. There need to be mechanisms in place to guaruntee such things like price stability and so on. Because people would never accept a solution which will lead them towards decades of instability until the market clears itself. 
That being said, can you link me to any sources that offer a serious proposal in which they not just speak bad on central banks and that crypto currency will be more justice and fair, but actually offer serious explanations for how that would actually work? In that sense, research papers would be awesome, but I am also open for any other type of source as long as the author really knows how our economy works and offers a solution, and not just critism.

That would be very helpful. Thank you guys!",1524625376,25/04/2018 03:02:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eqdmv/a_truely_decentralized_monetary_system/,1

What is Bitcoin? Intro to Bitcoin and NYC.,"WHAT IS BITCOIN?

Bitcoin is decentralized digital currency of the internet. Digital money on your smartphone. We all carry numerous plastic cards, folds of paper money and heavy, bulky coins to pay for our daily needs. Bitcoin is currency using only your smartphone.

No central authority, no banking institution. Bitcoin is open-source code whose transactions are ""confirmed"" by millions of peer-to-peer computers decentralized all around the world.

Bitcoin open-source code was published in 2009 and at that time was valued at a small fraction of one cent each. Just a couple of years later each Bitcoin was trading for a couple of hundred dollars a piece. All the while, the price of Bitcoin fluctuated wildly. A single Bitcoin now costs over $9,500 each due to its continued rising demand as more and more people begin to understand it.

Bitcoin is purchased online through ""exchanges"". And users can access their ""wallets"" by simply using their smartphone.

Bitcoin is money of the people. For the people. And by the people. Bitcoin offers banking to the world's unbanked. All that is needed to use Bitcoin is access to a smartphone and an internet connection. Bitcoin offers anonymity as well. A financial renaissance of sorts.

**Bitcoin is the future of money. And NewYorkCoin is the future of Bitcoin.**

WHAT IS NEWYORKCOIN?

NewYorkCoin is an improved version of Bitcoin. It's faster, cheaper and consumes far less resources.

NYC is open-source code published in 2014. NYC is not regional, as it's name may suggest. NYC is worldwide digital currency exactly like Bitcoin, in fact - NewYorkCoin is an actual fork of the Bitcoin code. With a proven 4 year blockchain.

NewYorkCoin (NYC) offers 3 major improvements to usability and scalability. NYC offers users no network fees. This feature in the code enables free worldwide money transfer. And NYC is lightning-fast. NewYorkCoin confirms transactions every 30-seconds. Compared to 10 minutes for Bitcoin. NYC also has low difficulty mining programmed into its code which enables basic computer equipment to ""mine"" (verify transactions on the network) using much less electricity than Bitcoin mining.",1524627410,25/04/2018 03:36:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8eql39/what_is_bitcoin_intro_to_bitcoin_and_nyc/,0

Why I Am So Passionate About Trading,"After 20 minutes or so of sitting here trying to figure out how to open this up, and coming back with nothing; figure I will just cut to brass tacks:  I am now roughly 4 months into this crypto journey and my head has YET to stop spinning.  I don't even know where to start trying to tell the story!!!  But this journey began years and years before bitcoin was even created, so we must start there.  
       
Little background on me, I first got interested into financial markets way back in 2001 (showing my age here!) and from my very first introduction into stocks, I was utterly and helplessly hooked. There is nothing else quite like it in the world. There is beauty in its simplicity, that at its most basic; financial markets are simply a place where buyers and sellers can come together to swap their 'goods' for a 'fair price' that they determine amongst themselves.   As our world and lives grow increasingly complex, that very basic process of buyers and sellers meeting and bartering remains intact.  There is also beauty in its complexity and its seemingly infinite ways one can approach financial markets.  There is nothing else like it in the world.  There is no other arena where the level of success is entirely dependent on how good you are at what you do.  For example, you could be the greatest salesperson in the world, but there are still certain limitations in place, such as the number of goods you have to sell, the number of customers you have to sell them to, and so on. There will always be certain limitations that are placed on you by forces greater than yourself, so to a certain degree, your level of success is not 100% merit based.  There are always variables outside of your control.     
   
Financial markets/investing/trading is the one 'job' in the world where none of those restrictions apply.  Your level of success IS 100% merit based.  How good you are, how much effort you put into 'mastering your craft', is how much you will get out of it.  Now, that is somewhat of a simplistic view, as one could argue a thousand different technical restrictions (such as when the markets are open, how many of that stock/coin/whatever people are willing to sell, how much capital you have) but when you invest in something, there is no 'max price', there is no 'cap' on your potential profits.  If you are willing and able to put the time and effort into figuring out some formula that works for you to consistently taking profits from the markets, there are quite literally no limitations on the upside.  There is no point at which the markets will say 'nope..you have made enough. You have maxed out'.  It is entirely up to you!!!!!  
   
There is such beauty in that! Such...fairness.  It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor.  It doesn't matter if you are an Ivy League grad, or a high school dropout.  None of those classifications and categories that society as a whole like to label you with, apply in the markets.  And as you now think to yourself, “But wait! It DOES matter if you are rich or poor”, I would argue that, while the 'rich' have certain advantages and quite possibly an easier path forward; the 'poor' has every opportunity to equalize any of those initial disadvantages through their own efforts.  By studying, by learning, by figuring out a 'magical' formula that works for you that allows you to consistently, and without limit, profit from any given market.     
   
I have always been so attracted to that idea.  That I can truly get out of this, what I put into it.  Something where I can take credit for my own successes. But also, to where I cannot place blame for any failures either, on anyone but myself.  Failures to which I have the complete ability to correct.     
   
I liken it to a giant jigsaw puzzle. One that you will never complete.  You will never truly master the markets. You will never know everything there is to know.  But each day, since 2001, I have been gathering puzzle pieces.  I will continue gathering pieces of this puzzle for the rest of my life.  Each piece I collect, I try to figure out where it fits with all the others, and eventually the image becomes more and more clear.   There is a certain freedom in the opportunities found in the markets that you simply cannot find anywhere else.  I know that if I want my own 'magic formula' to create my own success, the ability lies within myself, and myself only to make that happen.     
   
THAT is why I am so passionate about trading, and why I devote myself to gathering those puzzle pieces.  Because I control my level of success!  
   
Happy Trading and until next time,

Anyone else using Square's CashApp?,"I've been using the Cash app for a little while now (even got a sweet engraved card...lol) and it's been super easy, but then I saw they allowed buying and selling BTC through them. Originally, you could only buy it and sell it back at mid-market prices, but I've recently gained the ability to move it to an external wallet. (Apparently, it was soft rolled out by region or something, so not everyone had the ability yet. I understand this is old news to some..) I bought 100 dollars worth before and now I moved a little to my external wallet successfully.

Is there any reason why I shouldn't purchase Bitcoin through this app and move it to my wallet? It's seems too simple and if I want to trade with my Btc, I can just deposit what I want on Kraken. I bought the $100 worth and have only had about $88 to $95 since then, but it's been on a dip until now.. They claim no fees, but I haven't seen 100 since I bought it.. I plan to mostly HODL, so would this be an effective way to buy during dips to move to my wallet or am I missing something vital here?

Any help appreciated. Any sarcastic comments will only be appreciated if they are funny. 😉",1524645878,25/04/2018 08:44:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8es23p/anyone_else_using_squares_cashapp/,1

Advice Buying Bitcoin in the UK?,"Hello all. So I've been out of the Bitcoin game for several years and now I have some funds I wish to reinvest in Bitcoin for a long term hold.

I realise there's been controversies regarding unrealiable exchanges etc. The question is where should I buy my Bitcoin, and how do you recommend I hold onto them securely?

Previously I used to use Escrow and download the entire Blockchain locally but these days I assume it would take a good month. Should I use an online wallet? Is there a good source to simply but Bitcoin here in the UK?

Although I could search online I would prefer some recommendations.

"A thought on ""digital gold""","Theres lots of gold bugs out there saying bitcoin is a waste of time because it has ""no intrinsic value"". Somehow insinuating that for something to have value it needs to have physical use not just digital use. Obviously in a digital world this is just a stupid argument, but I digress...

I was thinking about good old Peter Schiff who hates bitcoin yet is trying to get the world to use goldmoney.com, which is basically a centralised digital currency backed by gold. The idea is you buy gold which is stored with them and issue you digital currency which is used on their platform. You can in theory then use that to undertake in commerce.

There is a lot wrong with this, from the fact you need to trust the company holding the gold, and trust the companies payment platform (hacked/downtime/goverment mandated shut down etc..). But I digress again.

My point is, they want to create a gold backed digital currency yet the only reason to back it with gold would be to instill trust in the form of scarcity, so that you can use the digital currency in confidence.

What Peter Schiff fails to see is that bitcoin achieves digital scarcity, and in a way where no one needs to trust in the company holding the gold or the platforms downtime or central servers getting hacked or government shutdowns. Not to mention bitcoin is global by default.

Bitcoin is orders of magnitude better than a centralised gold backed payment platform. If someone cant see that they either dont understand how bitcoin securely achieves digital scarcity or they are purposfully trying to push their own agenda for financial gain.

Buying goods using Bitcoin when price keeps fluctuating.,"I am looking to buy some goods using Bitcoin, and I deposited the exact cost of the goods into my coinbase wallet, but the price of bitcoin is fluctuating quite often (minute to minute). It's dropped enough to the point where I don't have enough in my wallet to buy the goods.

Whats the common practice you all take when looking to buy goods in the middle of tons of drops in price? Is there a time of day where the price is more stable? I don't want to load my wallet with too much extra as I don't buy goods using bitcoin often.


Thank you!

Silly question about Ledger Nano S,"Hello guys.

I have a simple, and probably silly, question about ledger nano s. I have 2,1 bitcoins and decided to move them to a hardware wallet to keep them safe.

The inquiry is: For receiving BTC do I need to have the wallet connected to the network? Or I can give the address to anyone and the transaction will be confirmed the next time the wallet is online?

I have seen some tutorials but all of them do the transfer with the wallet connected to the PC, this is why I have this doubt.

Apparently back in 2013 I was playing with bitcoins. I don't think I bought any but is there a program I can install to make sure I'm not destroying something I want to keep?  Assuming I can even remember any required credentials.

Live node wallet logic question. Need to get clarity.,"
Hi everyone! 

So we know the only way to get an actual blockchain balance of your wallet is using the getbalance command via cli.

Lets assume we need to set-up a deposit address and associate it to a user. We create our first address.

Then we have that user deposit something like 5 BTC to that address. So then if we run getbalance we now see the 5 BTC.

We then create a 2nd BTC address for another user.  That user goes ahead and deposits his own 2 BTC. We run the getbalance cli command and now it shows a total of 7 BTC.

So assuming now we dump the private key from the first address and open the address / New wallet using the private key on a completely virgin node. How many BTC will we have access to and why??

Your help and clarification is well appreciated.

Cryptseed dot info: has anyone used these guys?,"I'm not here to spread FUD, but I saw a post about this software on Twitter and went to investigate.  

While I think the idea is kind of novel, I got some wierd vibs while chatting with them (transcript below) and wanted to know if anyone here knew them and/or could vouch for the software.  Them not knowing about ledger passphrase support kind of blew my mind.  If I'm supposed to be trusting their software to encrypt my seed I would think they would know about their competition and the pros and cons of their service vs that competition, but maybe I'm being too harsh.   cryptseed dot info is the website if you want to check it out yourself.  

Bottom line, is this a real service or a sophisticated seed phishing attempt?

[19:41]	CryptSeed: Hello , new to cryptseed?

[19:41]	V1524685224637438: yup

[19:41]	V1524685224637438: just seeing what yall are about

[19:41]	V1524685224637438: and how it works

[19:46]	CryptSeed: Just an advance way of securing your seed codes from been compromised

[19:47]	CryptSeed: Our software encrypts your seed and makes it inaccessible or vulnerable to third parties

[19:48]	V1524685224637438: what does it use to encrypt? standard pw? how is that different from a 25th word?

[19:48]	CryptSeed: It encrypts your crypto currency seeds

[19:48]	CryptSeed: Are you new to bitcoin?

[19:48]	V1524685224637438: no

[19:48]	CryptSeed: You know what a 12 phrase is?

[19:49]	V1524685224637438: how is this different than a passphrase/25th word?

[19:49]	CryptSeed: Ledgerwallet is great but it’s not full security if you still have to write your 12 phrase down

[19:50]	V1524685224637438: thats why you have the passphrase, like the link I sent

[19:50]	CryptSeed: Let me explain , do you have a bitcoin wallet account??

[19:50]	V1524685224637438: yes

[19:50]	V1524685224637438: I have been in bitcoin for quite some time

[19:50]	CryptSeed: Can you login in now?

[19:51]	V1524685224637438: huh... login?

[19:51]	CryptSeed: Are you on phone or Laptop?

[19:51]	V1524685224637438: laptop

[19:51]	V1524685224637438: how do you login to your bitcoin wallet

[19:52]	CryptSeed: Login into your bitcoin account then go to settings to copy your 12 phrase or 25 phrase

[19:52]	V1524685224637438: ok

[19:52]	V1524685224637438: doen

[19:52]	V1524685224637438: done

[19:52]	V1524685224637438: now what?

[19:52]	CryptSeed: Then you download our software to encrypt your 12 phrase

[19:52]	V1524685224637438: ok

[19:53]	CryptSeed: Our software is presently free at the moment cuz we are trying to make publicity for it now

[19:53]	CryptSeed: It will be expensive when our promo time is over

[19:53]	V1524685224637438: ah ok

[19:53]	CryptSeed: So let me put you through this

[19:53]	V1524685224637438: How do I know you wont just copy my phrase and take my Bitcoin?

[19:54]	CryptSeed: You have nothing to worry about

[19:54]	V1524685224637438: do you have a github so people can reveiew the code?

[19:54]	CryptSeed: You are not sending your 12 phrase to us , it’s not visible to us

[19:54]	V1524685224637438: oh ok. Is there a way for me to check that that is not the case?

[19:54]	CryptSeed: You can trust us we are secure on https

[19:55]	V1524685224637438: oh ok

[19:55]	V1524685224637438: that makes sense

[19:56]	CryptSeed: Any question sir??

[19:56]	V1524685224637438: no, I guess thats it. If you aren't open source I don't think too many old bitcoiners are going to be putting there keys into your system

[19:56]	V1524685224637438: just FYI

[19:56]	V1524685224637438: we've seen too much

[19:57]	CryptSeed: You are not putting your phrase in our system ... you operate everything on your laptop ... we don’t have access to your laptop

[19:57]	V1524685224637438: ok.

[19:58]	CryptSeed: A trial might convince you

[19:58]	V1524685224637438: maybe...

[19:58]	CryptSeed: We are registered and 100 % secure with full encryption

[19:58]	V1524685224637438: i still don't know how its any different than 25th word protection that Ledger already offers

[19:58]	CryptSeed: I will explain to you

[19:58]	V1524685224637438: ok

[19:59]	V1524685224637438: https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161725-How-to-setup-a-passphrase-and-an-alternate-PIN-

[19:59]	CryptSeed: Your 12 phrase is majorly the key you need to keep safe ...

[20:00]	CryptSeed: If you get 25 phrase from ledgerwallet ... how do you keep it? You write it on paper right? That’s makes it vulnerable

[20:00]	V1524685224637438: ok... your not getting it, which makes me think you don't know what your talkign about

[20:00]	V1524685224637438: so that makes you very sketchy... just saying

[20:01]	V1524685224637438: I'll let you go

[20:01]	Visitor 'unlike' this conversation

[20:01]	CryptSeed: So we encrypt it for you and turn it to a q code and AES256 encryption code ... it’s unreadable to any third party unless you decode the Q code

[20:02]	V1524685224637438: or if you have your software send every seed thats entered into your database...

[20:02]	CryptSeed: We are a company ... we don’t have your phrase

[20:02]	V1524685224637438: can I verify that in any way?

[20:04]	CryptSeed: We have google verification and https encryption

Attack on cash: Wells Fargo's new policy. Soon all we will have is Cryptocurrency for privacy.,"""Cash deposits will be limited to account owners or authorized signers
What is happening
To help reduce criminal activity and protect your account, we'll be making changes to our policy for cash deposits made at Wells Fargo branches.

Once our policy takes effect in a few weeks, we'll only accept cash deposits into your Wells Fargo Consumer checking or savings accounts if it is coming from an account owner or authorized signer.

What you should know
If a non-account owner needs to deposit money into your account, they can deposit a check, cashier's check or money order, or use a person-to-person payment service like Zelle®.

Automated setup of a lightning node,"Hi! I've spent some evenings creating a script that automatically installs and configures almost everything to run a lightning node(Bitcoin Core + Eclair). It's based on https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit, a toolkit many IT professionals use to automate software installations and configurations in Windows with Powershell. Here it is: ""https://github.com/khaffner/Crypto-Currency-Tools/tree/master/Lightning%20Node"". The important code is in Deploy-Application.ps1, the rest is just the toolkit. Grab the ""Lightning Node"" folder, and run Deploy-Application.exe as administrator. (I know that sounds extremely sketchy, so I fully understand if you do not want to. The .exe just makes sure the .ps1 is run with the right privileges and execution policy, the source code is in the PSAppDeployToolkit repo.)
I wrote this after successfully manually setting up my own node.
I've tested it successfully on a clean Windows 10 1709 x64 virtual machine. Windows 7 and 8.1 (x64) may also work fine if Powershell and dotNET framework is fully updated to the newest version. This assumes your computer does NOT already have Bitcoin Core or Eclair installed. 200GB is currently required. I am new to lightning and do not know if the resulting config is good and secure. Even running it on Windows might be a red flag for some. Please read through the Deploy-Application.ps1 before running the exe. Be careful. Enjoy :)",1524691260,25/04/2018 21:21:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ex7sb/automated_setup_of_a_lightning_node/,4

New required cryptocurrency question when opening bank accounts in the US,"Opened a new checking account at a US bank today.  After going through all the normal identity checks the bank manager said they have two new questions they need to ask all customers that the Federal government is requiring:

1.  Are you involved in the sale or purchase of marijuana and will this account be used for funds related to that purpose?
2.  Are you involved with cryptocurrency and will this account be used funds related for that purpose? 

The manager apologized and said they were new and that she understood the pot issue since they have been dealing with that, but she didn't really know what cryptocurrencies are or why they need to ask about them.  She had to check boxes on the new account paperwork, they are not just verbal.

I briefly explained the situation but told them I will be using a credit union for my crypto transactions.",1524693065,25/04/2018 21:51:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8exg3k/new_required_cryptocurrency_question_when_opening/,6

Merge mined BTC/Rootstock hashrate ~10% of network (and other questions),"I presently observe that the mainnet beta rootstock hashrate capacity has increased to 3EH/s while Bitcoin is running around 30EH/s (bcash around 4 EH/s, similar to RSK). This ratio is sure to increase as the network exits beta. 

I begin to have thoughts revolving around soft forks.

Can RSK force a soft fork in Bitcoin if it obtains a majority hashrate?

Just a friendly reminder about talking money out of your house to buy Bitcoin...,"Not sure if you remember, but it has been 11 months since that guy bought 191 bitcoin by taking money out of his house ($329k.) 

The estimate was ~$1,707 per BTC. 

Right now, at $8,816 (CoinBase), his BTC is worth roughly $1,683,850. 

He said he would sell at $10k each BTC, but if he sold higher (like $20k) he could have turned $329,000 into $3,820,000. 

The point of this post is to remind people that 

1) if you put large money into crypto, expect to go grey quicker than normal and 

2) regardless of the price, there is a change to get rich, just takes time and a large bank roll.

To those of you investing in alt coins because you feel the price of Bitcoin is too high...,"In Stocks people lose a fortune because mentally they would rather own 1000 shares of a company that is not all that successful than owning just 10 shares of a successful powerful company.

The dream goes something like this ""I will start off by investing in that low end company and as I make money off that I will invest it in the big successful company.

That dream has turned into a nightmare for almost all that got involved with it.

I heard the same with crypto, people say, I can barely afford a tenth of a bitcoin, so let me invest in some alt coin, make some money, and then buy btc.

The charts have been consistent too, when Bitcoin rises other cryptos rise, however, as smart money moves into btc, we are seeing less and less of a rise on those alt coins when btc rises. 

Don't be left holding the bag. If your goal is long term, but whatever you can afford in BTC, keep adding as you can afford, and over time it will reward you. 

Look around you, Bitcoin ATM machines, websites mostly adding bitcoin especially as more and more go for product setups like BTCpay, trading sites have the most activity on BTC etc.

Happy Investing

The Ultimate Guide to BTCPay - The free and open-source Bitcoin Payment processor,"This is an updated and revised version of [""The Merchants Guide to BTCPay""](https://redd.it/81h1oy) I posted a few weeks back. After using BTCPay for 2 months in [my store](http://bitcoinshirt.co/)  and actively being involved in the community [on Slack](http://slack.forkbitpay.ninja/), my understanding of its technical aspects and the importance of such project have greatly improved. Due to recent events of payment processors cutting off the stores for no reason [like WikiLeaks](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/987531916055318528) the self-sovereignty of the merchants is becoming critical.

This updated guide assumes you’re a merchant who already understands the benefits and the risks of accepting Bitcoin. It's not technical at all. The goal to explain plainly what is BTCPay, how it works and cover advantages and disadvantages. The idea behind the guide is to inform both merchants and general public about the project and motivate them to try it out and support it. 

The official BTCPay documentation is [available here](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc).

**What is BTCPay?**

&gt; BTCPay Server is an Open Source **payment processor**, written in C#, that conforms to the invoice API of Bitpay. This allows easy migration of your code base to your own, self-hosted payment processor. [source](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver). 

To simplify the definition, BTCPay allows merchants to be their own bank, receive payments in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Doge and plenty other cryptocurrencies without the third party. BTCPay allows merchants to run their own node (or connect to someone else's node by using the hosts) and receive payments directly, P2P, with no fees, no intermediary, no censorship whle providing better privacy over their customers financial and private data. (PayPal shares data [with over 600 companies](https://rebecca-ricks.com/paypal-data/) )

The developer behind the open-source project is Nicolas Dorier, Bitcoin Core contributor. /u/NicolasDorier decided to fork the BitPay processor and create a different solution. His approach is very logical and works just like Bitcoin was supposed to work, peer to peer with no third party. You are your own bank; you control your funds, the payment processor can't just shut you down for political reasons or just because they do not like your business model. The project gathered a decent and very active community. u/codeoverwhelming is also a rock-star contributor to the project.   

**How BTCPay works?**
BTCPay on the back-end work just like any other payment processor. The customer adds item to cart, selects “Pay with Bitcoin”, chooses the cryptocurrency they wish to pay in, or convert (BTCPay currently supports over 40 cryptocurrencies through ShapeShift/Changelly conversion).

The important elements of BTCPay are :

* The server
* The plugin
* The wallet

You’re running your own **server** which runs the full node; the server is called BTCPay. Once installed it will be connected to your website's subdomain. To simplify this even further, you'll have a separate mini site btcpay.yourdomain.com where you will be able to check the invoices, manage your wallet, configure your store and much more. If you wish you can use this mini-website as a payment processor and help other smaller stores accept crypto for free or charge for the support. This does not mean you’ll have to check the invoices on the server, all basic information is available through your Woocommerce store and your order processing routine will not change in any way.

Though there are so many features you can configure, I'd like to mention **the Apps**.The apps will allow merchants at a later point to implement different type of features like : payment forwarders, ifttt integration, etc. The first app released is POS app which allows merchants to use BTCPay as a point of sale terminal and create invoices for their customers.

The **plugin** connects your server to your Woocommerce Store. It is a bridge to your store and your node. In the plugin settings, you can configure important options. A bit more advanced configurations can be adjusted on the server. The plugin helps you manage your store. It will automatically mark your orders as ""processed"" or any other status you've set. It will mark expired invoices as canceled, etc. If you're familiar with Woocommerce, let me tell you that there is no difference between the ease of order management between this and any other payment method in Woo. Our store is configured this way. Buyer selects ""Pay with Bitcoin"" at the checkout. The status of the order is awaiting payment. We set that after 6 confirmations order status changes to processing, at which point we know that the order is fully paid, which you can see in your wallet as well. 

Your receive payments to your **wallet** (it’s possible to configure Ledger Nano S hardware wallet or Electrum  right out of the box). You need to set your derivation path. This is what will generate different public address for your customer to pay. Each new invoice will have a different address, which increases the privacy greatly. At no point will you need to reveal the private keys during the setup..

This means that the buyer, pays directly to you in cryptocurrency and that the payment does not go anywhere else, the IP address is not leaked, the buyer data is not shared with a third party in any way. You will see the payment in your Bitcoin wallet. Electrum OR Ledger Nano S wallet integration to btcpay is needed.

BTCPay is not the only solution to accept cryptocurrency directly, but after months of trying out, I found it the safest, the most active, customizable and the easiest to set up. It just works.

**Difference between BTCPay and third-party payment processors**

Think of BTCPay as a server which allows you to accept bitcoin without intermediaries. You are your own payment processor. The payment processors act as a server as well, but your customer's data, IP addresses go through them. Furthermore, most of the payment processors hold your crypto payments, and you’d have to withdraw it or convert it, similar to what exchanges do. The last but not the least, third-party processors charge fees on your transactions.

**Benefits**

* You are running a full node and helping the network
* You are protecting the privacy of your customers 
* You’re using Bitcoin the way it’s supposed to be used, p2p, directly
* You’re avoiding fees that all payment processors have (monthly subscription/fees per transaction usually 1-5%)
* You can accept payments directly to your wallet, including the hardware wallet (currently integrated with Ledger Nano S well) and you’re the immediate owner of those assets
* You can be a host and help other smaller shops accept payments through their stores
* You can accept other cryptocurrencies through BTCPay directly(Litecoin) and over 40 currencies if you enable the ShapeShift integration
* You can  accept **Lightning Network payments** on the Mainnet easily 
* Multiple merchants can have the same server and host their stores together to save the cost (however only the main admin has access to the integrated lightning node)

**Disadvantages**

* Hosting such server costs around 20-60$ per month (the cost varies depending on the server you’re using, with the Azure, you can cut down the cost to little over $20). My cost for the previous month was 57$.
* It takes a bit more time to setup and configure to fit your store needs, (took 3-4 hours for myself, I’m not particularly tech-savvy).
* You can not convert to fiat currency right away like with some payment processors, though in my personal opinion, the immediate conversion ruins the whole point of accepting bitcoin and does not increase the adoption.  The fiat conversion is coming very soon on BTCPay and merchants will be able to immediately convert the whole amount or partial to their local fiat currency through the exchange.
* Shopify integration is  unavailable (being developed)
* PrestaShop integration is unavailable (being developed)

**Getting Started**

The entire documentation is [available on the Github](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver). There are several videos on YouTube which will help the newbies out which guide you step by step how to set  the BTCPay up.

Important note : 

1. BTCPay is in no way limited to Azure deployment 
2. Azure only provides the newbie-friendly solution with 1 click deployment.

Summary of this step is that you have to register with Microsoft Azure server. Upon registration, you'll get 200$ free credits which will be enough for the first few months of running the server, so basically, there are no upfront costs. **Be aware that BTCPay is free**; it does not cost a dime, you're paying Microsoft here for the server which will keep your node online 24/7. As mentioned, you can use other solutions (Docker).

After you register for  the server, there is a single one-click deploy button you have to click. It will take you to your Azure VM and configure everything for you. There are a few things you have to change yourself. Besides documentation, Nicolas made an easy to follow video for this. 

The next step is to connect your domain and your server, which is again very easy to follow up in the videos and documents.

The third step is to connect your Woocommerce store by installing the Woo plugin (plugin is free). 

The final step is to configure your (hardware) wallet and set the derivation path. I was amazed that Ledger configuration took only a few seconds. Nicolas did a great job with this one.

When you set up your store, it is highly recommended to test it out. Post any issues that you might find on the Github and if you have any questions, feel free to ask on Slack.

It's highly recommended that you first watch the following YouTube videos which will help you visualise the process much easier.

**FAQ**

Before I answer some of the questions I got from merchants, I'd like to tell that if you're a merchant and have any question, feel free to ask it here. If you're having trouble setting up your BTCPay server, [join the community on Slack](http://slack.forkbitpay.ninja) . There are developers and merchants there ready to help you.

&gt;Q: Where can I see the example of how BTCPay works and looks?

A: BTCPay website and if you want to see it live you can check the list of stores using it.

[mainnet](https://main2-btc-ltc.forkbitpay.ninja) and [testnet](https://test2-btc-ltc.forkbitpay.ninja) 

&gt; Q: Where can I get help/support?

A: BTCPay is an open-source project. The best way to ask questions is through the Slack group.

&gt; Q: Can the costs of running BTCPay be cheaper?

A: Yes they can. Currently, the one-click deployment requires Azure Virtual Machine, but if you’re a programmer or understand VM’s you can deploy one on a different VM. 
UPDATE: It's now possible to run BTCPay server with 50% decrease [by using this method](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc/blob/master/PennyPinching.md)

&gt; Q: I have a Shopify store, can I use BTCPay?

A: At this moment, no. Shopify is a closed system a company opposed to an open-source project like WordPress, so it’s harder to communicate to them and create a solution. Luckily there are developers in BTCPay community working on it. While I can’t give you precise information, I assume it will eventually be possible.

&gt; Q: Can I have more stores connected to my BTCPay server.

A: Absolutely, you can host multiple stores on the same server. The stores can operate and configure settings separately and receive payments separately.

&gt; Q: Why use BTCPay vs. just having a BTC address up on your site?

A: The most important reason - the privacy of your customers and your business. BTCPay will generate the new address for each invoice. You just need to select the derivation path for the address (I used Ledger Nano S). The second reason is user-experience. BTCPay integrates as a payment method to your store, so your customers can checkout with a few clicks.

Bitcoin Update April 26,"Bounce coming in at our first zone of support from $8.9-$9.2k

PRICE ACTION LEVELS 
Resistances - Price was promptly rejected at the .382 fib level at $9.75k we had outlined, sending price back below the $9.4k level of support, making this our immediate resistance. Above that we will keep our target on breaking above $9.75-10k and the .382 fib level.

Supports - At the moment we are bouncing from $8.9-9.2k zone of support, in confluence with the .5 fib. Below this level we support at $8.6-8.4k that also lines up with the .618 fib level.

Moving Averages - The ever important 200 MA on the daily chart is now lined up with a zone of resistance we have from $9.8-10k. A break above this would be huge for bullish confidence. We also now see the 200 EMA acting as support as prince pinballs between these two indicators.

Ichimoku Cloud - The 4H cloud has provided perfect bounce support off the kijun. We will see if this holds...

Oscillators - The daily RSI remains above the zone we have highlighted in the past confirming bullish movement. More interesting though is the 4H hidden bullish divergence right at support. Price is making higher lows while the RSI is making lower lows.

Conclusion

Price was rejected with force at $9.75k and the .382 fib. After such an incredible run in the past few days, this is not a big deal. We are surprised we did not see a pullback even sooner than today.
On the higher time frame we have needed to post a higher low after making a higher high above $9.2k. Continued upside still remains probable

Me: Ok, there is a Bitcoin **** (BTC) and there is also a ****** **** (***). First one is like gold, second one is like cash.

Distributed blockchain scaling solution. Example for Bitcoin. [IDEA],"Information disclosed in this post is valid as of the time of writing the post.

The current Bitcoin blockchain size is 194.88GB [1]

If we only count the blockchain headers the size of the blockchain is only 41.6MB [2]

There are 10511 nodes running. [3]

Currently, to have a node running it is required for you to download the whole blockchain.

Instead of each node having the full blockchain, each node stores a fraction of the blockchain.

If the current blockchain were split among all of the running nodes, each node would only need to hold 18.54MB of data (194.88GB / 10511).

Instead of relying on block explorer services an DNS like protocol would be implemented:

1.The client relays a transaction status query to any node.

2.1. (Case 1) The node has the block body which contains the transaction and relays it back to the client.

2.2.1 (Case 2) The node does not have the block body which contains the transaction.

2.2.2. The node relays the same transaction status query to two other nodes.

2.2.3. Repeat the previous step until the block with the transaction is found.

2.2.4. The client receives the block body and checks if it is valid by comparing the Merkle Root of the block header and Merkle Root of the received block body.

There is, however, a big problem with this idea. In reality, each node having a copy of a fraction of the blockchain would be exploitable. Once a node decides to stop being a node, a fraction of the blockchain is lost and transactions cannot be confirmed anymore.

An example solution to that problem is that multiple nodes e.g. 100 nodes store the same blockchain fraction. (Chances of all of the 100 nodes leaving the blockchain at the same time is low) but this increases the previously stated blockchain fraction size for each node from 18.54MB to 1854MB/1.854GB which is a big problem.

The solution to this is to have as many nodes as possible to reduce the size of the fraction, but how?

Nodes should be paid in newly generated Bitcoins for keeping the network running. (The number of nodes running would increase exponentially)

And the final problem with this idea is how to reward nodes for keeping the network running?

[2] The size of a Bitcoin header is 80B [a], the current number of blocks is 520000. 520000 * 80B is 41600000B which is 41.6MB

Must read - Economic freedom is NOT freedom to rob. Libertarianism is NOT immunity from legal consequences,"Threat of legal consequences seems to have the Bcash crooks, shills and sock puppets outraged.

*'How dare they take legal action?'*, thus spins the Bcash propaganda machine..

*'Once again Core supporters threaten with lawsuits and government intervention to try to get their way. This is just pathetic and not the foundations of what Bitcoin was built on. These are not bitcoiners.'*, writes a Bcash Mod.

I mean decentralization means lawless anarchy, right? Anyone can do whatever they like without any fear of consequence, right?

Since they're too dumb to understand decentralization - which is expected with their being the most centralized altcoin in the market - does not make them immune from legal consequences, allow me to expound upon some oft. misrepresented notions in cryptocurrency.

Government, economy and the law are altogether different entities. Bitcoin is about decentralizing governance and promoting economic independence and sovereignty. Bitcoin is NOT about lawless knavery.

It's unsurprising that Roger Ver, a jailbird, would misrepresent libertarianism as immunity from the law, or at least he would like for such a world where he can get away with his deleterious indiscretions with impunity. Roger wants a world where he can get his way by any means necessary - disinform, defraud, plagiarize and flout the law without consequence.

The greatest threat to decentralization is centralization. Of all the altcoins, Bitmain coin aka Bitcoin cash is the most centralized PoW coin, in terms of both hashrate and command of full nodes.

Bitcoin Cash renounced all right to be outraged by perceived dereliction of the blockchain credo by virtue of its mere existence.",1524742123,26/04/2018 11:28:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f1wk0/must_read_economic_freedom_is_not_freedom_to_rob/,6

Pinup art commission for Bitcoin and the crypto community,"As much as I love the [""Magic Internet Money"" wizard](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kN-euZQpGTqcvB4O5KhSlw.jpeg) as the ""face"" of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency community in general, I decided to commission some pinup art of ""Math"" and ""Cryptography"" personified to have as a visualization. I've got [a request out](https://np.reddit.com/r/HungryArtists/comments/8eqxpr/hiring_character_creation_for/) at the moment looking for artists, but thought I'd post here as well in case there's more people wanting to get in on this. I've gotten responses from several artists already, though some of them were thinking the 0.045 BTC \(\~$430\) I was offering was a bit too low for doing two quality, full character creations.

I'll keep looking to see if there's other artists that would be a good fit, but the funds for this commission I've moved to `18yYN7jCzLLzgGZpcTcjgTdvmV6P4asXA` now; if you think this is a good project to undertake, and want to add to the pot to increase the payout for the artist, and perhaps attract a higher tier of digital artist, feel free to add more to that address.",1524743536,26/04/2018 11:52:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f213y/pinup_art_commission_for_bitcoin_and_the_crypto/,1

Of course it will be available via amazon and others as well but as we wanted it to be purchasable with crypto we talked to our label and they let us have our own store. 

As we still sell the live merch by ourselves we just use our phones with dedicated wallets. But no one bought with crypto yet. Which doesn’t matter, we just want to raise people’s attention so that they see that you can actually use bitcoin. 

We accept btc, eth, ltc and of course doge:D

"Is there an estimate for the amount of mined BTC that are both *not* in circulation *and* inacessible to their (former) owners? Basically, the value of all lost wallets.","In 2013, I had a few BTC in a paper wallet that I used to make a transaction. There was a little residue (worth around €8 at the time) that I kept but quickly forgot about. I now have no way of accessing that wallet as I moved several times and probably lost the address and pass phrase. 

I’m not crying over spilt milk (I’m sure there are much much worse forgotten fortune stories out there) but in light of 17m BTC being mined recently, I wonder how many of these BTC are in fact lost like mine are.

One way of estimating this would be to look at the sum amount in all wallets without any transactional movement. But since what date - what do we consider an inactive wallet? To confound things even further, one cannot tell if an inactive wallet with no recent transactions is truly lost to its original owner, or the owner has simply been hodling all this time.

Nevertheless, I would be interested to see at least an estimate of these lost coins that will never enter circulation. Is it 10,000 BTC, 100,000 or 1m or more?

Bonus question: do you think that at any time in the next 100 years these lost coins will somehow reenter circulation, either by government intervention or re-mining? Before you answer, please keep in mind 100 years is a very long time!

Fud for thought,"Hey guys,

I'm a bit of a contrarian/devil's advocate type. I know a lot of you are bullish on bitcoin on just about all timeframes, but I'd like to warn you of some possible bearish scenarios with bitcoin you may not like.

First, the rally to 9700 got sold off really fast, which is a very bad sign. The last time a rally got sold off this fast was when we rallied to 11600. That eventually brought us down to 8400. This last rally was surred by manipulation and fomo rather than a genuine change in sentiment or the emergence of fundamental factors. Therefore, I don't expect it to last.

If you look at the big picture, you can see that 9700 has gone from being a region of massive support to massive resistance. That is a bad sign. I know a lot of you think that bitcoin will be worth 100k in five years, but a lot can happen in that time. Perhaps a new crypto currency will be developed that is used instead, or perhaps a fundamental flaw or limitation of the lightning network will be discovered. My point is that the permabulls treat certain things as absolute certainties which are only probabilities. If they are right, they will become very rich, but if they are wrong, they will lose a lot of money.

There isn't a whole lot of new money flowing into crypto right now, and google trends interest is flat or declining on just about every timeframe. To me, that's a warning sign that the market could drop significantly if even a few people leave, because there's not many buyers waiting to jump in.

Finally, the stock market is in trouble. A lot of money managers believe the 9-year bull run is due for disaster. Many people could seek to pull money out of stocks if economic difficulty looms ahead. If they pull their money out of stocks, they will probably also pull money out of btc as it is perceived as a high risk asset. If this happens at the wrong time, it could send btc spiraling downward.

For those of you who bought bitcoin when it was under 1000, you probably don't need to worry. What's a measly -30%-50% loss on top of nearly 10x gains? Yet for those of you who bought later, you may wish to sell now and re-invest later. I know many of you probably wish you had sold at 8,800 when the market slid along the bottom at 6.6k.

As a disclaimer, I don't know that anything bad is about to happen. I'm just trying to offer a different perspective than the one offered by the permabulls. It's healthy to have a well-rounded perspective that admits the possibility of scenarios you don't like. Go ahead, downvote this post. I already have enough karma.

On the positive side, the crypto market cap is absolutely tiny compared to all the money in the world. If fundamentals change and bitcoin starts to be used by serious players (i.e. nations and corporations) then we could see a valuation in the 30-50k range. Again, this is a possibility, not a certainty. If you want to hodl, prepare for a rocky road ahead during the next few months.",1524760943,26/04/2018 16:42:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f43qs/fud_for_thought/,2

Spoiler: The biggest bitcoin bull run ever is yet to happen.,"People tend to forget the implications of predictable and limited supply issuance.

Each prior supply halving in bitcoins history has been followed by a massive bull run. The halving is what triggers it, then price begins to rise and eventually explodes because of FOMO. It then settles at a price that warrants the new rate of supply.

The last halving was in mid 2016 which was followed by a small rally up to $1,000 then a FOMO fulled bull run.

This is just the natural process of the free market adjusting to the new rate of reduced supply.

What if we have only ever seen natural supply-halving induced bull runs. What if we have never experienced a true global investment induced bull run. What if the next bull run we see is not triggered by a simple supply halving but caused by global institutional investment.

That would make all previous bull runs look tiny in comparison. There is a big difference between markets reacting to changes in supply and a full blown investment induced bull run.

THE BIGGEST BITCOIN BULL RUN EVER IS YET TO HAPPEN!..

CryptoGO app gives amazing trading indicators!,"Hello Redditors,

I am a programming student and crypto-enthusiast. As a study personal project I created an iOS app named CryptoGO.

The app analyzes markets through an algorithm made of trading indicators (like the RSI and Ichimoku Clouds) and helps traders take positions. CryptoGO has it’s own EtherScan verified ERC20 token called the CGO. App’s users earn token when they are active and they can redeem them to their personal ERC20 wallet to store or trade them. The app also have a crypto-news sources aggregator where you can easily access the latest news and stay updated about the market trend.

I plan on launching an airdrop to reach more people and distribute more tokens!

This project was an amazing way to learn many different skills and add a pretty cool line to my resume, not a commercial thing. I’m just a 20yo guy trying to make things go forward. I know the app is not perfect but I’m sure it will be helpful to many people and I hope you will like it. Promoting CryptoGO is a way to see how far this adventure could go!

You can learn more about the project and download the app from the website https://cryptogo.tech/

Please drop me a line at contact@crypto.tech with any suggestion or remark you might have! Interested Android devs are also more than welcome!

Thanks a lot :) Martin

Duplicate coinbase transaction ID in the blockchain. Can receiver spend them?,"Hi, you might be aware, that there are two coinbase transactions with same id (hash) in these blocks:

https://blockchain.info/block-index/106662
https://blockchain.info/block-index/106692

This was fixed with BIP34. But still, I am wondering, if receiver can spend their outputs. In blockchain transaction input is defined by previous transaction output that is about to be spent, which is a combination of transaction id (hash) and numeric index of the output in this transaction. Logically this would not work in this case, since there are two transaction with same id. So are these funds lost forever or am I missing something and owner is able to spend them?

"Here are a few ways YOU can help remove BitcoinDotCom from the first listing on Google for ""Buy Bitcoin"" searches","[CONTEXT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f11fu/bitcoincom_is_first_result_in_google_for_buy/)

We'd be effective in numbers by: 

* Search ""Buy Bitcoin"" into Google. 
* Then scrolling down to the very bottom. 
* Click ""Send feedback"". 
* Include screenshot, highlighting the buy.bitcoin site. 
* Write a heartfelt message about how you thought you were buying real Bitcoins but the ones you spent money on were fake.
* [Here's a screenshot of my submission](https://imgur.com/a/e5Rf7nR)

Enough people do this, Google takes notice. Some pro-BTC dev decides to do something about it.

After all, Google's #1 priority after profits is User Experience. **If enough of us show them that they are promoting a negative user experience, they WILL act.**

Whatever you do, do NOT click the buy.bitcoin site and linger there because it gives them extra relevance. Instead, click on another legit/reputable site to show Google's algorithms that another site has more beneficial and relevant info (make sure to stay awhile on the other site, click through a few inner pages, at least stay 2-3 minutes)

And/Or you can click on to buy.bitcoin and click your back button IMMEDIATELY. That shows Google that site did not have what you need!

"PSA: There are many signs of the world going into the last phase of this economic cycle. Please be prepared, if you have debt I suggest you decrease it.","As the title say.

I strongly believe the world is entering into over-extension when it comes to debt and economic activity, for this cycle at least.

There are many reasons for this, but most importantly lower unemployment rate, and interests sharply increase! Every time interest rates has increased sharply markets (traditional markets) have tanked. 2001 and 2008 are good examples of this.

I am only writing this here because I believe that after a long while thinking, the best position to enter into when this cycle ends, is LONG Bitcoin. I do no longer believe that gold will be the best safe haven asset.

Therefore I urge all members of our community to handle their debt levels right now, so you don't have to dip into your holdings to alleviate the pain when interest rates go up 3-4%-points.

As for myself I will pull around 80% of the money I got in the stock markets the next couple months. And then watch Bitcoin closely awaiting entry. But who am I? You probably shouldn't take your advice from a 21 year old soon to be Econ undergraduate. So do your own research!


TL;DR: Interest rates are looking up, looking at history that is a sign that the economic cycle is about to turn. handle your debts, so as to not lose any coins in the process.

What is the best offshore destination for Bitcoin trading?,"You might consider Belize as the of still available options.

Belize's main financial regulatory body - the International Financial Services Commission (IFSC) - has appeared in crypto-news feeds a few times in a past couple of years to warn public about unlawful or suspicious activities of several crypto-companies. That, to say the least, is highly unusual for a state's monetary watchdog. We all have been already a little tired to see multiple presumptuous memorandums and nonsensical declarations issued by world's financial regulators, which right from the first page proclaim Bitcoin with the rest of crypto to be the enemy of humanity.

Against this background IFSC looks as a typical Marvel's guardian of the galaxy, endowed with an ugly face, and manners but of a just soul. Figuratively speaking, Belizean ""Groot"" is going after bad guys one by one as opposed to all-knowing ""Ego's"" indiscriminate slaughter. Matter of fact, compare to most world state finance guardians' quick-meal, flash-bang, shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi, IFSC's case-by-case approach to new digital economy participants may be considered as almost civilized.

Of course, at this early stage of crypto-industry's life most of us would prefer to have either nor regulation at all or a self-regulatory body staffed with crypto-professionals instead of clueless politicians and greedy lawyers. Alas, it's not the direction things are aiming for most of us. Belizean crypto-community may feel proud for itself being able to steer clear of any official regulations for so long. Coupled with IFSC's relative civility that may provide crypto-enthusiasts in Belize with a shadow of hope for a better than average crypto-future.

"We ain't seen nothing yet, still in the greed phase, wait till we get into the fear phase.......","Greed is a verry strong emotion.
Personally I think it's also needed to make progress, individually as well as humanity, of course everything has it's sane limits.

Although btc has a fundamental, in fact many,  reasons to own and use, don't foul ourself, most are just in it to hopefully make some gains and less for the believe it's a better system than our current fiat counterparts.

As usual humanity is overdoing it and the fiat system will be pushed over the edge, simply look at the debt trend, I do not even care much at what debt you will look at, it's getting out of hand on all.

There are even more risks but it is no bad thing to do some homework yourself.

The greed phase isn't at it's peak yet, I think institutional money will have to come in to get somewhere to the greed top.

But..., there is even a stronger emotion, FEAR.
Fomo, fear of missing out, is definitely close to it but to me it's an extreme form of greed, and will play an even bigger part than untillnow in the comming uptrend caused by the institutional inflow.

The real FEAR I think of, will be the fear when the fiat system will become more in stable, higher (hyper)inflation, the next round of collapsing banks, pension funds imploding etc.

BTC seems to be just the right idea at the right time to be an alternative and safe haven, besides some other time proven solutions.
If this play's out, like I'm convinced of, the unbelievable path we have been on until now will be looked at as just the first ramp up phase and in fact still a cheap and early get in phase.

Good luck riding out the comming storms.

"PSA: If you plan to use your profits as a downpayment for financing in the US, plan ahead (more below)","Skip a paragraph if you want the solutions I've found so far.

Everyone's experience will differ, but I just went through paperwork hell, only to be told that I would not be able to use any bitcoin withdrawals for any part of the financing process. (downpayment, deposit, insurance, closing, etc.)

Note: I am not offering any legal advice, this is just my experience with navigating this process.

1) I wish I would've pulled the bitcoin money out 6 months in advance. That's far enough out that a big deposit into my account may not have raised red flags. (again, I have no authority, just my experience)

2) I wanted to buy sooner, so I SHOULD NOT have sent the money into my main bank account. The loan officer was looking into the account that I would be using for the downpayment, so I should've avoided mixing that with Bitcoin all together. I was denied.

3) I had to think about how I would have the money for a downpayment without my bitcoin withdrawals. (i.e. if I had no bills for a few months and kept every dime I made from my job, would that be enough to replace the bitcoin money?) The answer to that was ""maybe"", so I used bitcoin in every legal way possible to avoid spending my regular paycheck. Sharing bills with someone left some possibilities open.

4) Still not enough?  At this point, I still needed help, but I got through it. Here's some fun facts about getting loans:

Monetary gifts are generally accepted with a simple signed letter for downpayment purposes. A generous person with a normal income can gift downpayment money. 

If the generous soul doesn't already have a bitcoin wallet, it would be a nice gesture to show them how to set one up. ;)

There's really nothing illegal about any bitcoin transactions. I even paid taxes on them. It's just this ancient loan approval process that makes it feel so sketchy.",1524818380,27/04/2018 08:39:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fa4rl/psa_if_you_plan_to_use_your_profits_as_a/,2

Why is Gdax Bitfinex's shadow?,"I noticed that some big whales or maybe gdax itself having a bot that adds buy and sell walls as soon as bitfinex changes price direction. Price on bitfinex goes down $20 for btc and less than a second later gdax adds a 10-40 btc sell wall to force the price to go down. Price goes up by $20 on bitfinex $20, sell wall on gdax disappears instantly and a 10-40 btc buy wall appears.
Buy/sell walls on bitfinex seem natural and are rarely removed which is not the case with gdax. When i got the first time in crypto, the buy/sell walls seemed to be a good indicator of short term price movement, but i found some time later that they are fake.
Coinbase/gdax is pretty big itself. I don't understand how they let bitfinex manipulate them. Something is really fishy about it. ",1524819554,27/04/2018 08:59:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fa7k7/why_is_gdax_bitfinexs_shadow/,2

Average miner buys more GPUs in 1 year than normal person in a lifetime,"So I did this test to see how many GPUs does the average miner have. Results are really unbelievable and it looks like the number is close to 18 GPUs in range of Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB. So if average person buys new GPU every 3 years that would mean that miners spend more money on cards in 1 year than normal person in a lifetime.

Back to the origin: the Zen way of looking at Bitcoin,"If one looks at the original form of value retention, one recognizes that the organization of this very form has taken place in a decentralized manner. Initially, goods were traded. Each market participant had its own strengths, which products or services it offered. A potential customer of this market participant also. By exchanging products and services manufactured or provided in-house, value was transferred, which in turn generated added value for both parties. In the course of time, alternative ways have been found to preserve value. For example, valuable stones, shells and eventually gold. The Community has consented to regard this as valuable and so the market has developed with pricing. This decentralised agreement is therefore the basic form of the human image. With Bitcoin something has been created that enables movement to the origin in this day and age and that is something truly valuable. Everyone should embrace this way of thinking and will realize what sustainable change technology can ultimately have.",1524829577,27/04/2018 11:46:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fb0dg/back_to_the_origin_the_zen_way_of_looking_at/,1

Quantum computers and mining,"Hey guys. Long time lurker in the crypto scene. 

Recently I've been mesmerized by the CES2018 (consumer electronics show) Intel came out and showed off a 40+ qbit processor. They were able to do incredible things with it such as volumetric cinematography where any angle could be calculated using only a few hundred cameras and quantum processing. The whole thing is super fascinating if you wanna check it out

But my question is will quantum computing have an impact on mining? Supposedly bitcoin won't finish mining till I'm dead. But what if advances happen at a rate we didn't forsee? 

Could a quantum computer solve blocks stupid fast or does it work on entirely different modes of logic?",1524830200,27/04/2018 11:56:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fb2dz/quantum_computers_and_mining/,0

Fast adoption = shitty adoption,"As the hordes flood the Bitcoin universe, it becomes clear that most people are not interested in the visions put forth by early adopters: a world without rulers; a world without government. They are mostly interested in continuing their lives and become rich by investing a bit in Bitcoin, completely missing the point in the process. 
The explosion in adoption the past year has flooded forums with fools and ignorants that makes shitty ""us vs them"" mentality kind of posts. I guess they did not have time to properly fathom the implications of this new tech.   
A reminder to everybody: Bitcoin is a libertarian/free market project, not a social one. There is no ""we/us/them"" in the seance of nations or collectives. There are only individuals doing what is in their own self interest. And doing that happens to solve A LOT of problems in the world today. 
Don't worry about what others do. You do what you like and find best for you. Be selfish. Be greedy. In the long run, it will benefit all human kind. 
Stop feeling like the victim. Stop the blame game and play your own game by the rules you see fit. 
If you don't like Bitcoin or any other altcoin, make your own. 
If you want security and don't like risk you should not be in this game.

"CBOE Saw Its Highest-Ever Bitcoin Futures Volumes Yesterday Apr 26, 2018","Two major markets for bitcoin futures contracts saw a major boost in volume on Wednesday.

Available market data shows that CBOE saw its highest-ever volume for bitcoin futures since it first debuted the contracts back in December. 18,210 contacts for the May futures were traded, along with 703 for the June contract and 87 for the July contract. No volume was reported for the exchange's August-dated contract.

CBOE Options Institute senior instructor Kevin Davitt, in a social media video posted on Thursday, said that ""[the] average daily volume (ADV) runs about 6,600 in XBT Bitcoin Futures. Yesterday's volume was nearly three times ADV.""

He went on to explain:

""Yesterday was the highest daily volume for bitcoin futures since their introduction here at CBOE nearly five months ago. The lead month May futures traded 18,210 contracts, and across the term structure a total of 19,000 bitcoin futures traded here yesterday. The previous high-volume session was January 17 with just less than 15,500 contracts traded.""

Wednesday's volume was an outlier among the past several days, as well as the results seen during Thursday's session. On Monday, XBT Bitcoin Futures traded at 3,881, rising to 6,653 on Tuesday. On Thursday, volume was reported at 5,634 contracts as of press time.

CME, according to market data, also saw a big trading day on Wednesday.

The exchange saw the volume of its bitcoin futures contracts market double on Wednesday from the day before, shooting past 11,000 contracts. Unlike CBOE, it was CME's April 2018 contracts which saw the bulk of the spike, according to its website.

The spike in January's volume coincided with the expiration of the first set of contracts, Davitt said. However, Wednesday's volume did not, nor did it have a 15-20 percent range in futures Davitt would otherwise have expected, he added.

""We will certainly be watching to see if this is a volume aberration or if more and more institutional types are moving into crypto,"" he said. However, he noted that ""the overall bullish sentiment continues in XBT Bitcoin Futures.""

Liberland; The Cryptoland,"


If you're a fan of cryptocurrency and your country has banned crypto, you should move to Liberland, the land that recently adapted crypto as their official national currency.


The Land was founded on April 13, 2015, by a Croatian economist and entrepreneur Vid Jedlicka, It lays on a 7 square kilometers radius, and it borders between Serbia and Croatia.


Liberland is right now accepting applications for citizenship and those wishing to end up as citizens have to stand by the rules and directions. Half a million individuals from over the world, including more than 20,000 American citizens and around 7,000 from the United Kingdom have as of now applied for citizenship for this Eastern European nation. Speaking for The Telegraph, a conference was composed by the pioneers of Liberland in April 2016. A significant point of talk at this conference was the blockchain. The blockchain is the innovation that empowered the bitcoin and cryptocurrency transformation. The funds of the nation as well are run utilizing cryptocurrencies.


Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that has gotten to become the global haven for cash. For a nation like Liberland, it makes sense to utilize Bitcoin as money rather than issuing modern fiat currency. Moreover, it would be much less demanding for Liberland to utilize bitcoin for exchange reasons as it can be exchanged consistently over the web from one wallet to another and settled in absolute time.


Can be read on its website


""The country is proud to grant personal and economic freedom to its citizens, guaranteed in the Constitution, which limits the power of politicians who cannot interfere in the liberties granted by the nation of Liberland.""


Everything is based on his motto: 


""live and let live.”

An example I could think of would be for example arbitrage opportunities due to different prices of the same cryptocurrency at different exchanges. I want to show that a certain inefficiency exists, and then in the discussion provide explanations for why those inefficiencies might exist.
My thesis should consist of analyses on several such inefficiencies. Help would very much appreciated!",1524860386,27/04/2018 20:19:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fepq0/need_help_with_master_thesis_about_cryptocurrency/,2
Is this legal on coinbase's part?,"I've heard the grumbling about coinbase but it was the quickest way for me to get in and I felt a price increase was coming. The other night I was considering selling a little bit but when I went to complete the transaction I noticed the price wasnt what the current value was. I waited and kept checking and every time I went to make a transaction, it adjusted the price in their favor. Right now the price is listed at 9112. If I go to sell, it shows it as 9068.  If I go to buy, it buys it at 9154. I've done this multiple times and every single time it goes in their favor. I called and asked for the end user agreement but haven't had a chance to look over it. Is this an accepted practice?  Is it a case of ""the price you see is what it's market price is, but we're selling you something we own and can set our own price?""  Does anyone have any insight?

Absence Wallet - Web Developers Needed,"I am, with a photoshop designer, creating a crypto platform wallet that will not only have an excellent UI, but implementations of new technology as fast as possible. It will come preloaded with Native Segwit and Legacy and I will try and learn about the Lightning Network as soon as I can and attempt to implement it. I am aiming to make this wallet something that your grandparents can use - I will try and simplify as much as possible and add features like handles so others using Absence Wallet can receive payments without the need for long addresses that can be mistyped and in future after extensive penetration testing and extensive research on encryption methods, I might implement a username and password system instead of the current 12 word system.

Now on to why I am posting - I need a web developer who can design a website where the user can get information and download the platform. **YOU WILL NOT BE PAID**. I am working on this project for free and so is the designer, however that does not mean we will not send you part of the donations we receive if you do a good job.

If you feel like you are the right man for the job, email me at: p0isoN@absencewallet.com.

"No Ver, Bitcoin cash isn't Bitcoin","I think the worst part about what Ver is doing is that he is trying to provide as many reasons why it is Bitcoin while completely ignoring that it isn't Bitcoin, period.  
1. I don't care if BCH is a worldwide ""peer to peer electronic cash"" system as originally envisioned by Satoshi. Is it BTC? No, so it isn't Bitcoin, it is just an alt.  
2. It doesn't matter if BTC fees are high, no merchant will use it and it just sits there forever. That doesn't make BCH Bitcoin because it isn't BTC.  
3. I don't care if BCH has the perfect roadmap, the best tech, the best community, and the most adoption. What is the ticker? Is it BTC? Then it isn't Bitcoin. There is one Bitcoin and it is BTC.  
 
It isn't about distribution, adoption, technology, use in the real world. None of that matters. This is about value, we have the BTC and no one else does and if they want it then they are going to have to pay for it. Big time.

Fossil fuel industry,"This post is slightly in jest, but with a sincere curiosity. This is from a new account, but this is not trolling. I’ve read the sidebar, and while this could be considered a bullshit post, I am genuinely curious. How is this is NOT a scheme? 

With respect to the hilariously wasteful amount of energy expended to acquire any cryptocurrency, I wonder if anyone has considered it a ploy of the fossil fuel industry to reap profits before our global society reality sets itself amongst ‘greener’ pastures? Can any persons opinion be proven?

This exact scenario has been set by many an industry, in different ways. Look at the internet costs in America. A hundred dollars for a single solid, fast connection, and then more for the bundled television (yet another dying industry leeching on the backs of...)....

5G will bring wireless internet to all. Wired connections will be for schools, governments, and the like. 

Cryptocurrencies allow a philosophical quest to be fulfilled. Can people wrap their minds around the concept of monies, and how it exchanges? Can they understand how mining works? Is the investment both financially AND reflecting personal time consumption ACTUALLY worth the return? As a hobby, this is of course like an opinionated divestment - a return based on the ‘feels’ of a side gig. 

I see it can be more, but it seems a lot of bubblin...

Does it matter?

My Poem to Bitcoin,"Dear Bitcoin



I'm into you like Abbott is into contracts

I fell in love with you without physical contact

Stock brokers like to say crypto is fake

But you're the capital of ""is real"" and what we got is real 




The darkest era of your volatility makes my heart feel

even when alt coins look like bargains and a steal

I see superb, presidential, when what I look at is true

Like africans are into dashikis, I'm so into you!




My mind cant escape the depth charts and candle sticks

My thoughts are laminated into it like a preserved project

It takes years to build something and a day to destroy it

and I want my interactions with you to yield a profit




So forgive me if it seems like you don't matter to me

My body language lies to avoid a catastrophe

I don't want to put more into you than I can afford to lose

But as I'm losing, I lose and you're what I choose




I'm up for you bitcoin, as long as I'm alive
 
Stuck with you like dreams of escaping the 9 to 5

You matter that's why I've been mining, wasting all this electricity

So return to the previous high, bitcoin, return for me ",1524886313,28/04/2018 03:31:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fhc8z/my_poem_to_bitcoin/,0

The countdown of bitcoin mining: 4 million is left,"Since January, 2009, the first bitcoin has been mined. It cost about 200 days to mine 1 million [bitcoins](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin), while it cost over 500 days to supply 17 million bitcoins. It is reported by CNBC that the surplus bitcoins will be mined in the next 122 years. 

The report from [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/page/2/?s=bitcoin) showed that 17 million bitcoins has been mined, which means the global miner will compete the surplus bitcoins. 

The CEO of Cosima Capital, Brandon Williams thought the data above reminded us of unstable price, but bitcoin is powerful as never before. Not only because of the improvement of its expansibility and the decline of transaction fee, but also the limitation of bitcoin. 

 The bitcoin investor, Ansel Lindner declared that the information above will show the scarcity of bitcoin, which will push the [bitcoin price](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin) eventually.

Bitcoin is not security. ICOs should be regulated.,"Cryptocurrency became the focus during the hearing between American Congress and Securities and Exchange Commission. In the hearing on 26, April, they discussed the regulation of cryptocurrencies. They thought the environment now is disordered. 

Considering as the authority in the topic of cryptocurrency, Jay Clayton described it as complicated area, which was divided into currency and ICOs. He said, “Most people don’t think [bitcoins](https://www.coindesk.com/page/2/?s=bitcoin) are security, but I think they are.”

“If bitcoins are regarded as security, we should regulate it.” He added.

Clayton admitted that the rise of [bitcoin value](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin) brought large financial profit. However, the policy makers are still thinking how to regulate the market.

You may define what Bitcoin is to yourself. You may not define what Bitcoin is to others without their consent. https://t.co/6vVRhoVTZm,,1524917033,28/04/2018 12:03:53,https://i.redd.it/aqgmll9p3nu01.jpg,7
Let's go over good vs. bad hardware wallet design.,"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hoofoo-the-world-s-first-hackproof-bitcoin-wallet#/

This is an example of an awful hardware wallet design.  To understand why let's refer to the OG the Trezor.  

1.  Reliability.  The Trezor doesn't have a battery.  That means when it's in your pocket there is no chance of someone coming by and wirelessly stealing your private keys.  I expect my hardware wallet to be stolen/lost.  That being said I do expect that my device be able to work as long as I take care of it.  Having a battery kind of limits the shelf life to 5 years or so. 

2.  Keep it simple stupid. The Trezor only has a USB connection.  That's okay.  I'd rather see a camera personally.  My understanding is the chip with the private keys is not connected to the USB output so that's good.  

3.  I still have limited trust in hardware wallets.  AFAIK the Trezor doesn't have an exploit that allows the private keys to leave the device without modifying the hardware.  This is an acceptable limitation.  

4.  The Trezor is open source.  

5.  The Trezor has a screen.  This is absolutely vital to prevent man in the middle attacks.  It's moronic to have a hardware wallet without a screen.  

6.  When you access your Trezor it presents you with a randomly ordered keypad you enter your pin through your computer with a mouse.  This way there is no way to keylog or screen cap your pin. 

So lets talk about the hoofoo.

1. It doesn't have a screen.  This is an immediate disqualification.  There is a very real possibility that the address would be swapped in memory and you wouldn't know. 

2. It has wireless communication over bluetooth.  Bluetooth is not a good standard for hardware wallets to use.  For one you're broadcasting the encrypted data wirelessly.  Not all encryption is created equal.  AFAIK all the wifi standards are crackable with sufficient data collection in less than a month.  [look up blueborne](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2017/09/12/BlueBorne-Bluetooth-Vulnerabilities)

3.  As a general rule I'll never buy a product that claims to be ""hacker proof"" unless it's got a REALLY good design.  This isn't it.  

4.  2FA?  On a local device that makes no sense.  Maybe they are talking about a 2FA through the blockchain with multisig but that costs money.  Is he really saying 2FA is your fingerprint/facial recognition (both trivially compromised (seriously just use a picture of the owner) and spoofing a bluetooth device.  This sounds so simple and easy I halfway want to buy one just to crack it the first day.  This doesn't even qualify as 2FA in my opinion because both of the factors are controlled by a single device.  The entire point of 2FA in my opinon is to have a completely separate device be responsible for authorizing you.  Otherwise there is no point the device is a single point of failure. 

5.  OMFG It allows you to access signing your private keys with finger print and face recognition... thats MORONIC!! Fingerprint scanners are in no way secure and face recognition ... did you see the apple keynote or youtube? This is probably the worst hardware wallet ever created.  

6.  These idiots actually believe that you can't fake a bluetooth mac address?  (again this guy is blatantly lying when he says that hardware wallets like the trezor have been hacked w/o a hardware modification)

7.  What the fuck is a motherbox?  Having 2 devices that can recover your private key ... Does he mean seed?  Does he not know the difference between a seed and a private key?  Nothing in the video indicates he's using the BIP39 standard.  What happens when your house burns down and you lose both your hardware wallet and the motherbox?  What are the design specifications on this motherbox?  Sorry but if it's capable of recovering private keys and seeds then the security details surrounding it need to be gone over.


Hoofoo is a scam.  The claims made are provably false.  Do not support this company.  

Security features I'd like to see in a future version of a hardware wallet are as follows.

I really like the features of the trezor, they got a lot of things right as I mentioned above.  Limited communication access on old wired technology.  A screen.  The way you input the pin so it cannot be screen recorded or keylogged (they should disable keyboard input on internet connected devices but that comes down to user error I guess)

1.  I'd prefer the USB to be charge only without communication.  Instead I'd rather use QR codes to exchange the unsigned and signed transactions back and forth.  I could see the device allowing you to scan a QR code, and you verifying it looks good.  Then putting in your pin to sign.  

2.  I'd like the option to hold a small battery powered qi charger to the back of the device to provide it power.  

3.  I'd like the device to ship with the components visible in a clear plastic coating.  I would like to be the one who encloses the device and that case once put on cannot be removed without destroying the hardware wallet.

Banking Bans - Forced Retirement from BTC,"I am now banned from banking with the following financial institutions:

RBC, TD, CIBC, Simplii, Scotiabank

I explained the story in earlier posts but to sum it up let me explain my story. Just to be clear I pay capital gains on any profits that I may make during my trading. 

Formerly I used to mine BTC and sell them on local bitcoins. I had been banned from TD and Scotia for selling BTC a few years back. They didn't explicitly tell me that was the reason. But inquired solely about my BTC related transactions. 

Fast forward a few years and I have my RBC relationship terminated. They contacted me regarding some cash deposits. I told them I sold some stuff online but they inquired as to what it was exactly so I provided proof of the exchange. Was told they have a zero tolerance policy on crypto. 

Then April 18th I get a letter from CIBC and Simplii. Now I have not been contacted by CIBC beyond this letter, however I do use both Simplii and CIBC to send etransfers to purchase BTC and cash deposits through CIBC to accept payments for BTC from local bitcoins. 

The letter essentially reads as follows:
~CIBC has made the decision to end your banking relationship with its group of companies. Future requests to open accounts or products will be declined...Our decision is a result of the unacceptable risk that we have identified with regard to the operation of your account~ 

So now, since I only have BMO remaining that I am not banned at I am going to have to stop being involved in bitcoin (at least to the point of any bank involvement). 

Does anyone know any alternatives or any suggested course of action that I might be able to take?",1524927266,28/04/2018 14:54:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fkd8t/banking_bans_forced_retirement_from_btc/,2

A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System (aka Satoshi’s Vision).,"Peer to peer cash is not about cheap fees, it’s about eliminating the 3rd party. Discouraging users from running a node, wanting to move nodes to specialized and expensive data centers, and being perfectly fine with being PayPal 2.0, creates exactly the 3rd party that bitcoin tries to eliminate. Bcash and bitcoin are not siblings, they are polar opposites.

Everyone has to promote and use Bitcoin if you really want it to succeed.,"And i'm not talking about making tons of money out of it by succeed, i mean to become a real useful global currency.
Just do simple things, try to buy what you can with bitcoin, you don't have to invest in it too much, if you want to buy a thing from somewhere and they accept bitcoin, just buy bitcoin of that value and use it.

Ask shops if they accept bitcoin, if everyone will ask this, more shops will start accepting it.

Bitcoin is still young with massive room to grow, and we can make it happen.

If everyone will only care about HODLing and not spending and using bitcoin, we won't get anywhere.

I know most of us want to get something from it and i believe there is something to gain for everyone, but to get something we have to do just a bit more then just hodling.",1524942301,28/04/2018 19:05:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8flzkd/everyone_has_to_promote_and_use_bitcoin_if_you/,0

"Why Bitcoin should be priced in ""Bits""","All forms of money need to be easily broken down into identical sub units.

To the average person who stumbled across Bitcoin in 2017, the idea of a ""Bitcoin"" didn't make sense. How can I use a currency so expensive that I can't even own ""one""? Why should I buy .01 of a $10,000 Bitcoin?

Most of us understand that Bitcoin can actually be divided into 100,000,000 Satoshi's, making Bitcoin one of the most divisible currencies in the world, while retaining its perfect scarcity. However, most people are just now learning that **YOU CAN BUY A FRACTION OF A BITCOIN**.

But even when they understand that, many people still perceive the price of a single ""Bitcoin"" to be super expensive, as if they missed their chance to buy Bitcoin on the ""ground level"".

When the masses started coming during late 2017, the price of any coin under $1 exploded to the moon, all because people thought they missed out on Bitcoin and wanted the ""next big thing"" \- expecting these coins to potentially reach $10,000 as well.

# Bitcoin -&gt; Bits

Breaking Bitcoin down into Bits is ultimately something we will need to do if we want the world to utilize Bitcoin as a usable \(linguistically\) currency. It makes more sense to buy a beer for 500 bits \($5\), rather than .00005 Bitcoin.

Similar to a stock split, this will give people the confidence to go buy 100 bits, and it will make them feel richer. Nobody likes to say, ""I own a small fraction of a Bitcoin."" They like to say I own 500 \[insert coin here\], or 100 Bits.

A move from Bitcoin to Bits will spark another retail investor rally, and make Bitcoin a more ""speakable"" currency.

# My Plan to Break Bitcoin into ""Bits""

I run a web app: [MoonRekt.com](https://moonrekt.com/) \- a top 100 list/portfolio tracker. Now before you downvote me for shilling my own project \(I'm just a college student contributing to the community\), let me tell you it's 100&amp;#37; free, and I'm using it as a platform to spark the break Bitcoin into ""Bits"" movement. From now on, Moon Rekt will only quote Bitcoin in ""Bits"", and I encourage anyone running other Bitcoin apps/wallets/exchanges to do the same.

**Current Bitcoin Price: $0.0093** \- slightly less than one cent.

We should all start using Platforms that use Bits and also begin speaking in terms of ""Bits"". We need crypto Twitter to get in on this. We need other websites and apps to get on this. We need exchanges to get on this. And we need CNBC to get on this.

The Bitcoin community is what controls Bitcoin, and if we all decide to start pricing Bitcoin in Bits, then the world will listen. Let's put an end to other worthless coins.

Let's start a rally in Bitcoin that will change the way the world views money.

Who's with me?

How some central banks cursing at Bitcoin may occasionally help it local growth?,"Despite of a relatively high rate of fixed Internet penetration, which reaches to almost fifty percents, as well as the fact that Cape Verde Escudo has been devalued for more than 20% relating to USD in the past decade, local population doesn't seem to be too enthusiastically engaged with crypto-currencies business at all. However, as new class of digital assets continues to grow in popularity with investors around the world, this situation is about to change.

That was inadvertently confirmed by the Banco De Cabo Verde in one of its official ""comunicados"", signed at 29 March 2018 and named ""Alerta Criptomoedas"". This omnipotent one-pager presents itself the usual and all-so-familiar aggregation of anti-Bitcoin invectives. Various phraseologisms like ""transactions with virtual currencies pose a high risk"", ""offer no protection to consumers"" and ""its association with illicit schemes"" are spilled all over it. Notwithstanding, this ""Alerta"" might be as well viewed from an entirely different stand point.

Besides reminding residual investors about the existence of absolutely new, but not yet locally legalized assets class, the Banco's memo also demonstrates that crypto-phenomena has proved itself to be so omnipresent, that it has became nearly impossible to ignore it even for the absent-minded watchdogs living in the most geographically as well as financially remote parts of the world. With that said, however, we must add, that it might, still, be much more preferable for the local crypto-community (if such has ever existed) to stay hidden from the increasingly perceptive radars of the Cape regulators, which previously have never been noticed for a liberality of their views on the financial markets.

We need to get Bitcoin into popular media.,"Here's a good example of what I'm talking about.

We have a unit of Bitcoin called a [milli](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Units).

Every time I see that unit I can't help but think about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQcAnw4bcLA).

How do we accomplish this?

Ideas? :)

Edit x180428.0204utc : I think what I'm trying to get at is... Someone pointed out that Bitcoin is still solidly in the realm of techies and such. It's shifting this public perception that I'd like to pursue with pop-media campaigns.

We have great name recognition, as pointed out in the comments. Everybody knows Bitcoin, but when they think of it they think of people like Tim Draper, or me, the IT guy who says boring or funny computer things occasionally.",1524964933,29/04/2018 01:22:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fo8sb/we_need_to_get_bitcoin_into_popular_media/,0

roll my own btc payments,"are there any roll your own solutions to receive bitcoin payments?

All the callback/forwarding APIs have annoying limits.... minimum purchase/expensive fees etc...

for example:

I sell some goods for only $5 \- so this rules out [cryptapi.io](https://cryptapi.io) and [btcapi.org](https://btcapi.org) especially when the price of bitcoin jumps \- as the minimum transactions here are only 0.0005BTC

I want something similar to the [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) v1 API \(v2 has the ridiculous 20 address gap limit with no way to clear out unused addresses...\)

this is what I'd like:

\-generate a new address

\-forward to a holding address once payment is verified as being the correct amount and save order in my database

I have found [apirone.com](https://foundapirone.com) and their api looks good, but they have a 0.0002 BTC fee, and also charge network fees.

Calculation on Tax,"Hi all!

So I've now calculated the tax, and I'm wondering if I've done it right.

First of all, I made a sheet for every Cryptocurrency/Altcoin on both of the buys and sell side and summed up the number of coins and their value in BTC. 

Afterwards, I've subtracted the value in BTC on the buy side with the value in BTC on the sell side.

In cases where the sum of the number of coins was higher on the buy side than the sell side, I took the differential and multiplied with the average price of that very coin (average price on buy side) and subtracted it from the value in BTC on the buy side. I then took that and subtracted it with the BTC value on the sell side.

Example:
Number of Coin A, bought: 1100 --&gt;1400 USD
Number of Coin B, sold: 1000      --&gt; 1500 USD

The average price of coin A= 1 
100*1=100 USD

Correction

Coin A, bought: 1300 USD
Coin B, sold      :1500 USD

Profit; 200 USD

In my case, I have not used USD, but the value in BTC. Afterwards, I took the result of every coin and summed it all. In my case, the number was negative, unfortunately. I took that number and subtracted it with the value in BTC I started with and multiplied it with the price of Bitcoin 12.31.2017.

I subtracted that number with the price in USD I bought the bitcoins to find how much I've lost.

Does this seem right?

So I did something good today..,"Good morning everyone;
 When someone in real life asks me about Bitcoin I usually give them a basic one minute summary and refer them to Bitcoin.com frequently asked questions section. As of recent events, I can not in good faith recommend someone that website so that they accidentally end up investing into bitcoin cash instead of real bitcoin. To come up with a solution, I thought, I’m going to create a website thats just a basic FAQ of Bitcoin for someone who doesn’t know anything about it. So now I tell people to go to *BitStarted.org*

I made this website in just a few hours the today so, as you can tell, its in a very basic stage right now. I am looking to improve it and I wanted to get your feedback/help.


**Any feedback is definitely appreciated.** I’ve made a small list of some specific things I thought would improve the website.

* What are some common questions that people ask you when they don’t know anything about bitcoin? (looking to add to the FAQ section).

* Proof-reading of my English. I am not a talented write and any improvements are appreciated.

* Elaboration on some things/things I’ve missed

* Additional sections on the page


I have also given myself a budget of $100 for the project. I am looking for some people who I can pay in Bitcoin to do some unique logos or graphics for the website/infographics etc. Of course, I will pay you guys in Bitcoin.

The real Bitcoin doesn’t have a massive marketing team behind it constantly promoting it. So it is up to the user base to promote it. *I hope this website and this subreddit will be a part of that.*",1524978411,29/04/2018 05:06:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fpcyu/so_i_did_something_good_today/,4

Open Letter to Warren Buffett Regarding Bitcoin's Value,"Hello Warren,

I owe you some thanks for your books and letters, which defined my interest and views of investing as a teenager. I saw your interview on Yahoo Finance this morning regarding Bitcoin (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-buying-bitcoin-not-investing-110702015.html) and felt there are some simple values to Bitcoin that you have missed in your analysis of it.

1) Bitcoin has the cheapest security of any asset

If you buy some stocks, how do you store them? Via a broker. How do you ensure their authenticity and legality? By the faith in the exchange and regulatory authorities that monitor their trading. How do you ensure their value? By faith in the issuing company's reports, which by proxy represents trust in the company's leadership, accounting team, and 3rd party auditors that have reviewed the facts of the company. What happens if any of the above lie or malfunction? The value of your stock is lost or reduced. The above are all examples of security, and are required because without them we could not have faith in a stock.

Bitcoin requires none of the overhead of traditional assets to maintain its security. Bitcoin's network of miners produces better security than traditional assets at 1/100th the cost. This means to store value, Bitcoin is the most efficient means known to man.

2) Bitcoin transfers value cheaper and faster than any asset

Bitcoin's developers have created a new network on top of Bitcoin called Lightning that transmits any value of Bitcoin instantaneously for fractions of a cent. The network has the same security as Bitcoin. This means that if someone wishes to send money to someone else, Bitcoin is the most effective means known to man.

3) Bitcoin will be free of inflation

While Bitcoin's current inflation rate is around 3%, it will approach zero over a period of years. Because Bitcoins do not settle in dollars, this puts the static yield of Bitcoin in dollars at the same as USD's inflation rate -- approximately 2% - 3%. Even minus the speculative increases in Bitcoin's value, Bitcoin does in fact produce dollars just by holding it.

Bitcoin does have other values, but the 3 above are the most important ones. They show 1) why Bitcoin has value and 2) that Bitcoin produces income. For me this qualifies Bitcoin as an investment. I do agree most people entering into Bitcoin are only speculating on the price action, so I appreciate your warnings to people in that regard.


Thank you for taking the time to read my letter,

So, is it possible for Alice to have more than the sum balance of Alice+bob ? (in this case : 3mbtc).

Is it possible to start with :


A=1 # B=1 // B=1 #C=1


And finish with :


A=2 # B=1 // B=1 #C=0

or

A=3 # B=0 // B=1 #C=0

or

"If a country bans bitcoin, investors will move away","In Puerto Rico, there is no tax on crypto. You can hodl and then once you are a multimillionaire you can just go to puerto Rico and retire. If a country bans crypto or excessively taxes it, bitcoin holders can just move, depriving the country of tax revenue and business while the crypto friendly country receives business, capital, and potential tax revenue. This means there is a price to being crypto unfriendly. A country does so at its peril. Countries don't matter anymore. 

The people don't bow down to countries anymore. Countries bow down to the people now.

Is this how Lightning will operate when it matures?,"Tell me if I’m missing anything important in the steps below.  Please ignore that I’m making the network simple and my Lightning payments only travel through the same 3 nodes.  Also, please ignore that the fees listed are for easy calculation and not meant to be exactly what will be charged for these transactions.

Start with 1 BTC in wallet regular Bitcoin wallet as well as 0.01 BTC in wallet on Lightning Network.

Buy lunch almost instantly on Lightning Network in the amount of 0.001 BTC and also paying 1 satoshi to Node A and 0.5 satoshi to Node B in fees.  Current balance 1 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.008999985 Bitcoin in Lightning wallet.

Buy soda from vending machine almost instantly on Lightning Network in the amount of 0.0001 BTC and also paying Node A 0.1 satoshi and Node B 0.05 satoshi and Node C 0.1 satoshi in fees.  Current balance 1 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.0088999825 BTC in Lightning wallet.

I need to make a car payment and there is not enough in my Lightning wallet so I move 0.05 BTC from regular wallet to Lightning wallet.  In the same blockchain transaction, the remaining 0.95 BTC in the regular Bitcoin wallet are automatically moved to a new address in the same regular Bitcoin wallet and this transaction has a mining fee of 1000 satoshi.  This takes approximately 30 minutes to get 3 confirmations.  The 0.95 BTC \(okay, 0.94999 after the mining fee\) in the regular Bitcoin wallet are still recoverable by the same secret 12 words even though they are in a new address in the regular Bitcoin wallet.  Balance after the 30 minute wait is 0.94999 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.0588999825 BTC in Lightning wallet.

Pay car loan almost instantly in the amount of 0.03 BTC on Lightning Network and also pay Node A 30 satoshi and Node B 30 satoshi in fees.  Current balance 0.94999 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.0288993825 BTC in Lightning wallet.

Payroll sends me a notice requesting the Lightning Network address my payroll should be deposited in.  A few seconds after signing into the payroll system and giving the address, my 0.1 BTC paycheck shows up in my Lightning wallet.  Current balance 0.94999 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.1288993825 BTC in Lightning wallet.

Pay house payment almost instantly of 0.05 BTC on Lightning Network and also pay Node A 50 satoshi and Node B 25 satoshi in fees.  Current balance 0.94999 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.0788986325 BTC in Lightning wallet.

Pay electricity bill almost instantly of 0.01 BTC on Lightning Network and also pay Node A 10 satoshi and Node B 5 satoshi  and Node C 5 satoshi in fees.  Current balance 0.94999 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.0688984325 BTC in Lightning wallet.

I look at the spending money I need for the next couple of weeks and decide I don’t need this much in my Lightning wallet so I move 0.055 BTC into a new Lightning address.  I then close this new Lightning address with 0.055 BTC and send the funds to my regular Bitcoin wallet for a fee of 500 satoshi.  Current balance 1.004985 BTC in regular Bitcoin wallet and 0.0138984325 BTC in Lightning wallet.  This takes about 30 minutes to get the 3 confirmations that show the transaction is virtually impossible to reverse.

So the cost of the 2 transactions from the regular Bitcoin wallet totaled 1500 satoshi.  I like to think that these satoshi were well spent as they are paying for the security of the Bitcoin network.  While the 5 Lightning Network payment transactions cost a total of 156.75 satoshi.

It is important to note that the Lightning Network does not replace the traditional payments from a regular Bitcoin wallet to another regular Bitcoin wallet if that’s how you want to send your BTC.  The Lightning Network runs on top of the Bitcoin network and does not interfere with the traditional Bitcoin transactions.",1524995861,29/04/2018 09:57:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fqgeu/is_this_how_lightning_will_operate_when_it_matures/,7

Hardware wallets are not necessarily secure,"Security is about making sure that particular operations are impossible (or intractable) to do. The entire design of the software or the device must always respect these impossibilities.


The first security invariant for bitcoin wallets is that the seed, secret, nor private keys may touch the internet. It must be made impossible to copy them.


Since hardware wallets generally get connected to the laptop over USB, and the laptop is in turn connected to the internet, the only thing standing between the secrets and the internet are just some flimsy software abstractions.

Just look at the interconnected USB device, your laptop, and the internet. It is physically not impossible to copy the secrets to the internet.


A hardware wallet device should simply not work like that.


It may work like this: The user proposes an unsigned transaction as a QRCode to the device -- otherwise isolated from the network -- get the device to sign it, and then copy back the signed transaction again as a QRCode to the network connected viewer, which will broadcast it to the bitcoin network.


Existing hardware wallets do not operate like that. 


Therefore, I consider them not particularly secure. Furthermore, I really do not understand why anybody considers these USB hardware wallets to be secure in any way. What exactly would they make impossible to do?

BitRocket: The Game is a classic iOS arcade game with a Bitcoin twist,"This game is called BitRocket: The Game and it may look like something you have seen before, but it has a twist that I think is new. The gameplay is relatively simple and already seen: with each tap, the main character, BitRocket, gains altitude and the point of the game is to evade the space mines for as long as you can. However, the score is calculated by multiplying the number of achieved taps with the current price of bitcoin. 

This way, the high score is not only dependant on your abilities, but also on the cryptocurrency market. This way, I wanted to combine a really simple game with the crypto market. 

Oh, and I may have said before that the game is simple, but it's up to you to decide that. The game should also not be boring ;)

New to Bitcoin - Understanding Transactions,"I'm totally new to Bitcoins/Blockchain, and I'm just beginning to understand them slowly, after a lot of research, so please bear with me!

First, I want to clarify my understanding of Transactions

Transaction Level

There are inputs and outputs. Outputs have the public key (address) of the person to whom you want to send bitcoins.
Inputs reference the output of those transactions from where you originally got the bitcoins (These are your unspent bitcoins picked up by your wallet)
Say, you got bitcoins at 2 different addresses/public keys (1+1). Then you wanted to send those 2 Bitcoins to someone.
*So, the input should have the transaction ids, the public keys (your addresses where you got the bitcoins), and they should ""individually"" be 'signed' too, right? 
My question is, what is that entity(say, X) that's being digitally signed?* I'm imagining this - 
**
Inputs
TxId1 - PublicKey1 - X - (X signed with PrivateKey1)
TxId2 - PublicKey2 - X - (X signed with PrivateKey2)
**

**Also, is the entire transaction being sent by the Payer (inputs+outputs+anything else) also signed with an altogether new private key??**

My understanding is that the overall transaction signature tells nodes that it was indeed sent from the Payer.
Also, the individual signing in the input tells the nodes that the Payer indeed owns those unspent Bitcoins (basically, PublicKey1 decrypts signed X, matches with X, and the node then knows that indeed the Payer owns the Bitcoins he's spending)

The nodes then individually check if the Input Bitcoins are unspent using an index of unspent outputs of all transactions, checks the total amount from inputs &gt;= output

Is my understanding correct?",1525021525,29/04/2018 17:05:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fsni2/new_to_bitcoin_understanding_transactions/,1

Bitcoin.org Reverts Back to 2010,"Bitcoin.org Reverts Back to ‘Fast’ and ‘Low Fee’ Descriptions on Front Page
This week after a few months of controversy, the owners of Bitcoin.org reverted its descriptions about what Bitcoin is on the website’s front page back to “fast peer-to-peer transactions” and “low processing fees” after removing the descriptions this past January. The front page descriptions were changed by the website’s co-owner, a pseudonym called ‘Cobra Bitcoin,’ who has been a very controversial character in the cryptocurrency community. 

“Thanks to Segwit and batching, http://Bitcoin.org  is now once again advertising “Fast peer-to-peer transactions”, “Worldwide payments” and “Low processing fees” as key features of the Bitcoin network.” Cobra explains to his followers on Twitter. https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin
Two days ago Cobra reverted the Github pull request https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/2010 and merged the 2010 descriptions back to Bitcoin.org’s front page.

in my opinion what we really need now is an easy way to accept LN payments,"It's now very easy to pay LN invoices, so easy in fact that there's even an app out on android and that was a huge step. 

I ordered a sticker the other day and read articles on yalls.org and it's amazing, if you haven't tried it yet definitely grab a handful of satoshi and try it for yourself. 

With that done the bottleneck in public testing has now moved on to accepting payments, it still takes quite a bit of work and technical knowledge to set up a node etc. In fact I'm currently struggling through that myself (new node soon yeay) and I'm not stupid but it's hard and takes considerable effort.

I can't wait until some sort of easier way comes along, maybe even a buffer that takes LN payments and forwards substantial sums to a BTC address. ",1525024409,29/04/2018 17:53:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fsz55/in_my_opinion_what_we_really_need_now_is_an_easy/,1

Non-mining full nodes: isn't this video wrong?,"So I got this video recommended on YouTube, decided to watch since I was having a debate about this just recently:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM_Ski2eK6A

Correct me if I'm wrong (or support if I'm not), but aren't some of the important aspects of running a full (non-mining for this example) nodes:

1. They will reject blocks in the process of verifying the transaction within them if they detect an invalid transaction and refuse to relay this block further to other nodes, thus they increase the number of honest nodes and help protect the network against an evil miner passing fraudulent transactions out?

2. When new nodes connect (either boostrap and need to download the entire blockchain from start or sync), they help distribute the load so that no nodes gets overloaded from traffic requiring them to send blocks to sync up?",1525025480,29/04/2018 18:11:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ft3ko/nonmining_full_nodes_isnt_this_video_wrong/,1

Fastest way to collect Coinpot Doge on Iphone,"It came to my attention a lot of people will claim coinpot when they can, but have limited access to a desktop computer. If you happen to have an iPhone, I have a workflow widget that only takes 4 minutes to run through but collects all 7 faucets and then a bitcoin lottery after. It’s useful if you travel or go on vacation and want your loyalty intact (sorry androids, I am sure there is something comparable available!)First if you aren’t already, you need to register with coinpot.co

Then download workflow if you don’t already have it for iOS, and use the widget down bottom

To get it working just get workflow from the Apple store (free of course) and then download my widget shortcut below (also free of course)

Workflow by Apple https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8

Check out the workflow I built!

https://workflow.is/workflows/c0a3b90f89d54327892a270789f96ff1

All you do is run the widget, it loads up browser and you make your first claim, scroll down a little bit and “Done” shows up in the top left, click that and it loads the next page in line. It’s really quick and saves so much time. When you finish it sets a reminder for 1 hour, and next time you run it just asks permission to delete said reminder

Enjoy and happy collecting!!",1525026848,29/04/2018 18:34:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ft996/fastest_way_to_collect_coinpot_doge_on_iphone/,1

What is the peculiarity of this particular platform? This is the first such project on the blockchain platform. And this project has already generated great interest among users. I think this should be invested at this stage, because it will bring a big profit in the future. Another interesting feature is that the program synchronizes data with real sporty data.

"Taxes - How are you dealing with forked coins, such as holding BTC and receiving BCH?","I read tax people saying we should value the BCH from the time it first appeared. But that is unrealistic, as it is not like a stock which is actually available from the time of a split. It takes technology to be able to safely split the coins.

I'm thinking I'll use the price from when I first split the BCH from my BTC.

I guess then I owe short term capital gains on the full value of it at that point?

BTC monthly limit is 30 million txs (with Segwit and Snorr). Is it correct to assume that BTC does not able to support more than 30 million LN users?

I guess I'm not the only one who knows it can be annoying to send your coins too an exchange, trade them and send them back to your wallet. This sometimes takes way too long and can be very stressful. Also some exchanges definitely carry the user identification too far.
For this purpose I created a small service bot on telegram, which carrys out the whole exchange process for you. 
Would be great to get some feedback from you. (If you are interested please test it with small amounts at first - it's still under developement)

"If admissible and necessary, this e-mail exchange between Satoshi and Hearn could be the single strongest piece of evidence in dismantling Ver's position.","*This was also posted to the Telegram chat*

I thought I’d offer what I consider to be the most decisive piece of evidence contradicting the claims by Ver et al that “BCH is Bitcoin”. 

I say decisive because there is no formal support for such claims; they necessarily and entirely depend on an appeal to authority. That authority is accessed by reference to 1. the writings of Satoshi Nakamoto and 2. the Bitcoin whitepaper. Reference to either of these is of course fallacious, as Satoshi is inaccessible and interpretation of the intent behind his writings are purely subjective, and thus unfalsifiable. That being said, Ver et al will likely lean on such a priori appeals to support their defense. And this piece of evidence 1. meets Ver’s assertions *in kind*, on his terms and 2. wholly contradicts them.

Here is reference to the source: The April 12, 2009 e-mail exchange between Mike Hearn and Satoshi Nakamoto. [Source](https://pastebin.com/Na5FwkQ4)

The rest of the related e-mail exchanges can be found [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2080206.60)

The revelant sections can be found on lines 12-23 (Hearn’s question), and then line 63 (Satoshi’s answer). They read as follows:

Hearn:

12. Specifically, it's not quite clear to me what blocks contain. If I

13. understand correctly, there is only one (or maybe a few) global

14. chain[s] into which all transactions are hashed. If there is only one

15. chain recording ""the story of the economy"" so to speak, how does this

16. scale? In an imaginary planet-wide deployment there would be millions

17. of even billions of transactions per hour being hashed into the chain.

18. I realize that each PoW can wrap many transactions in one block,

19. nonetheless, that's a large amount of data to hash. If there are many

20. chains, how are transactions assigned to each chain such that it is

21. still difficult to overpower the network? Eg, if there are 10 global

22. chains, the amount of cpu power you need to beat the system is only

23. 10% of what it was previously.

Satoshi:

63. There is only one global chain.

There you have it. If Ver appeals to Satoshi’s original intent to justify BCH as Bitcoin, or an implementation of Bitcoin, or a branch of Bitcoin, we have it here, in black and white, direct from the horses mouth. “There is only one global chain”. A possible major complication here, however, is we have no access to the original e-mails. Unless Hearn offers them, or is compelled to hand them over (unlikely), all we have is the reproduction.

Whether this is ultimately admissable or not(or even needed), what we can all take from this exchange is that Satoshi explicitly stated, from the very beginning, what Bitcoiners have implicitly understood all along: Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Hope this helps!",1525048083,30/04/2018 00:28:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fvlme/if_admissible_and_necessary_this_email_exchange/,1

Manually moving private keys from one wallet to another?,"I know there are a lot of walk throughs about getting private keys out of the Schildbach wallet. And I'm good to go there.

Is my best option here just to use the ""sweep private key"" option and manually enter them?  Or is there a tool I am missing that will help me out here.  ",1525058316,30/04/2018 03:18:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fwktp/manually_moving_private_keys_from_one_wallet_to/,1

What are you thoughts about lightning networking forcing bitcoin to turn Proof of Stake??,"I'm posting this because I genuinely want to know other peoples thoughts on this. I dont take sides in this kind of political drama. I copied this from the other sub.

""""TL;DR: LN hubs will out-compete miners in the transaction fee market, leading to hashpower flight and potential chain death, which will be ""saved"" by a transition to PoS to allow LN hubs to take over block generation and validation from miners).

LN requires locking up funds into each channel you open; you can only send as much as you have committed to the channel. The more channels you want to open, the more different places you have to lock up funds. Because of the inconvenience (and cost!) of opening multiple channels, there is incentive for ""super nodes"" to act as hubs with numerous channels (so users only need to open one channel to them to pay anyone), but this means those hubs must commit a LOT of BTC to allow sufficient liquidity to handle peak transactions. This will require them to charge fees for users, or else they have no incentive to lock up that much of their holdings. As long as the fees they charge are below on-chain fees, it will be cheaper for users to transact over LN than on-chain.

This essentially creates a hybrid PoW/pseudo-PoS ecosystem, where the LN hubs will compete with miners for user transactions. It's not ""really"" PoS since hubs don't generate or validate blocks, but the net effect is the same. In this scenario, LN hubs have the competitive advantage: faster transaction times, and no protocol changes necessary to adjust their fee structures--they can go as low as they want if they can take advantage of economies of scale. The only way miners can make themselves more competitive would be by increasing blockchain capacity, which requires a hard fork, and so makes them much less agile.

Now put yourself in the position of a potential investor in BTC infrastructure--you can use your capital to buy mining hardware, or set up a Lightning Network hub. The hub is the better investment, clearly--all you have to buy is a lot of Bitcoin, which appreciates in value and is liquid. Mining hardware is specialized, illiquid, and requires maintenance, storage, and significant energy costs. Considering that the equilibrium will always favor hubs as well, the choice is clear--less overhead, lower start-up costs, drastically reduced risk, greater liquidity, and a likely greater return on your investment.

The result? Miners lose money and we get hashpower flight from the BTC blockchain in favor of any competing coin that retains PoW and on-chain scaling. The BTC blockchain becomes increasingly crippled, incentivizing further consolidation of hubs so that users can avoid the blockchain altogether and just do everything on LN. Hub providers can either invest in mining to keep it going for the decreasing number of closing/opening transactions, or just liquidate their investment and bail...or, the blockchain can hard fork to proof-of-stake and allow LN hubs to take over block generation and validation.

If BTC adoption has grown sufficiently large at that point, and on-chain transactions have become sufficiently problematic, that kind of hard fork could get a lot of backing. Especially considering that as hashpower flees, difficulty drops, and the amount of computing power needed to perform a 51% attack may drop to non-prohibitive levels, reducing network security. A wealthy and highly-centralized hub (or hub conglomerate) may even be able to buy majority hashpower, and at that point can revoke the security of LN too! If a centralized hub is able to control majority hashpower, they can block broadcast of channel-closing transactions at will, particularly transactions that should validly refund users for uncooperative behavior from the hub. Transition to PoS could potentially be the only way to prevent that without killing Bitcoin, as a PoS implementation could cap the amount of influence on the network a node gets, breaking the incentive toward centralization.

The only way I can see to avoid this is if something gets built in to the Lightning Network protocol to prevent hubs from reaching a certain size, or otherwise disincentivize the creation of large centralized hubs. Not sure how that would be done.

Am I missing anything, and/or are there flaws in my reasoning?""""",1525060529,30/04/2018 03:55:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fwrwr/what_are_you_thoughts_about_lightning_networking/,1

Why aren't European based exchanges integrating with banks through the PSD2 initiative? 

Consumers can now buy crypto without having to worry about VISA/MASTERCARD fees and also without having to transfer money from their account to the respective exchange's bank account. Exchanges can now pull money directly from the customers bank account \(with their consent\) and load up the respective customer's account in the exchange.

"[Help] Sent BTC for Overstock Purchase, Website Never Registered Order","As the title states, I purchased something on Overstock yesterday with BTC (roughly $570 worth) and my purchase is not in my purchase history, and I never received a confirmation email.

The only thing I have as proof is the BTC Transaction ID, which shows it went to an address which Overstock provided.

Note: I have purchased almost $1,000 worth of items from Overstock with BTC before, and everything went through smoothly at that time. Any help would be appreciated.

ps. This is the conversation with Customer Support. I thought it had a hilarious ending: 

Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:28:50 PM): Hello *Baby_Vegeta*! Thank you for contacting Overstock today! My name is Kumar, how may I help you with your order? 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:30:12 PM): Hello, I ordered a product on Overstock with Bitcoin, and it's not showing that I ordered it. I sent the payment yesterday, and your site shows no record of this transaction. 
Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:31:15 PM): I understand that you haven't received an order confirmation email. I will be glad to check your account and help you further. 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:31:24 PM): Thank you 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:31:42 PM): It also does not show it in my order history on Overstock.com

Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:32:35 PM): May I have your phone number please? 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:33:13 PM): I'm in the UK, but I ordered to a family member's address in the US, and gave the phone number *phone number* I believe 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:33:25 PM): However, my number in the UK is *UK phone number* 
Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:34:27 PM): Thank you for the details. Would you mind holding for 2 minutes while I check on the information? 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:34:38 PM): That's fine 
Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:37:34 PM): Thank you for your time. 
Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:37:52 PM): Do you have any other phone number please? 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:38:18 PM): An old phone number of mine was *phone number*
Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:39:32 PM): Thank you. 
Kumar (4/30/2018, 4:39:45 PM): I apologize as unable to locate the order. 
Me (4/30/2018, 4:40:48 PM): What can I do? I already paid about $570

Fastest way to collect Coinpot on Iphone!,"It came to my attention a lot of people will claim coinpot when they can, but have limited access to a desktop computer. If you happen to have an iPhone, I have a workflow widget that only takes 4 minutes to run through but collects all 7 faucets and then a bitcoin lottery after. It’s useful if you travel or go on vacation and want your loyalty intact (sorry androids, I am sure there is something comparable available!)First if you aren’t already, you need to register with coinpot.co

Then download workflow if you don’t already have it for iOS, and use the widget down bottom

To get it working just get workflow from the Apple store (free of course) and then download my widget shortcut below (also free of course)

Workflow by Apple https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8

Check out the workflow I built!

https://workflow.is/workflows/c0a3b90f89d54327892a270789f96ff1

All you do is run the widget, it loads up browser and you make your first claim, scroll down a little bit and “Done” shows up in the top left, click that and it loads the next page in line. It’s really quick and saves so much time. When you finish it sets a reminder for 1 hour, and next time you run it just asks permission to delete said reminder

Enjoy and happy collecting!!!",1525110813,30/04/2018 17:53:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g1enh/fastest_way_to_collect_coinpot_on_iphone/,1

Trading/Value Question (ETH -&gt; BTC),"Hey guys,

So I have a basic question, and it may be more obvious than I realize..

So I bought some ETH around $1200ish/1ETH a few months back, and I'm wondering if I should just wait for it to go back up to the price I bought it at and sell / convert to BTC if it reaches $1200 again... or if I'd be taking a loss by converting it to BTC now at around half the value.

I realize the value of ETC/BTC is different than USD, but I'm not sure how I would work out my losses/gains. Any help or guidance / pointing in the right direction would be much appreciated.

Thanks!",1525115467,30/04/2018 19:11:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g20qw/tradingvalue_question_eth_btc/,1

Sadly a financial need has arised and I need advice on selling by BTC and BCH,"I have been holding for a few years and have been enjoying the ride towards the moon.  However, I have a need in which I need to sell some BTC.  Since it has been a few years and I have not kept up with the times well I would appreciate some help to make sure I am not scammed in some fashion.

First, I have moved small amounts to different wallets so I feel comfortable transferring my BTC to an exchange.  From my research GDAX seems to be one of the more user friendly exchanges with lower fees.  Has anyone had a bad experience with this exchange? Should I avoid using them?

The confusing part for me is the different methods to claim my BCH.  I have one wallet on Android wallet and another on Bitcoin-qt.  from research I have found the following bitcoin cash wallet https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hashengineering.bitcoincash.wallet&amp;hl=en_US on the play store that I should be able to import my android bitcoin wallet into.  Is this a reputable wallet?  I plan to move my BTC to an exchange before trying to import the keys into this wallet, but was not confident if that was secure enough.

As for the BTC in my Bitcoin-qt wallet I plan to follow the following link. https://techhelpkb.com/claim-bitcoin-cash-from-bitcoin-core-to-an-spv-wallet/  Again I feel as if everything is safe as long as I move my btc from the wallet before trying to import the private keys.  Any risk with this one?

Thank you for anyone who has time to respond to this.  I could also use advice on BTG as well, but its not high on my list due to their current value.",1525117564,30/04/2018 19:46:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g2amq/sadly_a_financial_need_has_arised_and_i_need/,1

2019, LTC halves. This will offer a test run for 2020. I've decided I will not sell any of my currently held crypto to put into LTC because the road maps of these are great at the same time. So have decided to sell non crypto assets. i.e precious metals for Litecoin, and sell out Litecoin just before it's halving, returning the profit or loss back into P.M.

Bitcoin halving 2020. Rinse and repeat, yet this time gamble everything. All Alts. Anything from my physical world, turned into Bitcoin. I owe no debt, so bitcoin any debt I can obtain for the couple of months. 

I'm after constructive criticism. This is my first, and maybe only, get filthy rich quick scheme. What have I missed? ",1525120144,30/04/2018 20:29:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g2msa/my_bitcoin_get_filthy_rich_quick_scheme/,1

SIGHASH_NOINPUT - looks like we should do another UASF,"SIGHASH_NOINPUT can be a game changer.  
It should make LN watchtowers much easier to use. In today implementation there is a **SMALL**  risk of watchtower going rogue (bug or on purpose) and broadcasting your old state. This can lead to the other party broadcasting punishment TX - and you loosing funds.

Bitcoin's Halving Opportunity,"Bitcoin is due to halve, apx around late May 2020. This could be a major financial opportunity.

WellsFargo just blocked cash ATM deposits from non account owners - probably to block LocalBitcoins.,"Here's proof. They just sent me this email:

This effectively blocks LocalBitcoins and ANYONE wanting to pay you directly but remotely.

Also, I LOVE how they mention Zelle.  The payment service they own.

""Zelle is a U.S.-based digital payments network owned by Early Warning Services, a private financial services company owned by the banks Bank of America, BB&amp;T, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, US Bank, and Wells Fargo.[1]""

Bitcoin is better for investing than the stock market for young people.,"Bitcoin has proven its ability to go over 20k USD. If it ends this year at 10500, that's STILL a better yearly return than the stock market. So, if you're dollar-cost-averaging into a Roth, TSP, 401k, etc., but not buying bitcoin as a young person, what are you thinking?? It's not too much money, if you invest what people typically invest into traditional savings vehicles (5-10%). If you even took 1% of that, and stuck it into bitcoin... 

I just find it funny. So many people are saying this is a boring time in bitcoin, while it's still gaining around 5% from week to week... just imagine what the talking heads would say if the DJIA were doing that... ""oh no, we're overheating! Sell sell sell!!!""
