It's gonna take patience fellas. We must understand that.,"The past 4-6 months were so ridiculous insane for Bitcoin. Some people jumped in thinking this market behavior was the norm, 3-5x... returns all day right? 

Lets not forget that the vets and lambo pimps everyone is envious of hedl and increased positions though a drop from &gt;1000 to like 4 or some super crazy shit like that (not gonna look up the actual numbers). To make the matters even worse, bitcoin froze around those lows for years! Fucking years dude! Years of ""oh shit, wtf just happened to my money?"" while today, most of us panic sell after 5 minutes of a drop. 

Nonetheless, I don't think you can invest in anything  better than bitcoin / crypto today unless you're in real estate or sell a startup or invent some super dope shit. I think Bitcoin will be at least 50k in the next 3-5 years; a 3-500% return, avg. 100%/year. Where else can you beat that? I've accepted that I won't get mega rich off Bitcoin and I'm stoked for the ladies and gents that did, but I also think it's the best current allocation of my money. 

The timing of that Ver attack was incredible, as they slammed the market right when a massive influx of main street jumped in. The chain was spammed and fees inflated, making bitcoin almost static precisely as the volume of incoming cash to the crypto market was at its peak. That scared people, and in conjunction with Wall St. manipulation and FUD, here we are today.

It's going to take time ladies and gents. You will win, but you have to leave your money there for a while. Understand that you will only lose when you sell at a price lower than when you entered. Don't spend what you might need anytime soon cause thats what fucks most people; something shit happens and you need money now, taking a loss if the price is lower. Be patient fellas. I know it sucks, overnight millionaire would be awesome... But in time, we will all be stoked. The entire sector of Finance: how we exchange money, pay for things, and transact with each other every day will be evolved because of Bitcoin. Hang in there. We will be alright. 

Good Luck.

Mergers and aquisitions,"In the world of finance, m &amp; a is happening all the time.

What about in the blockchain sphere?

Why shouldnt bitcoin consolidate or acquire good blockchain tech that could help it maintain its dominance in the market.

As an example, Bitcoin and Digitbyte would be perfect, with digibytes utxo blockchain track record and specs...it could take bitcoin to the next level...

There are many scenarios out there...

Any thoughts?

Ever wonder if btc futures was the phantom menace of bitcoin?,"When futures were being hyped, everyone was piling in because of the effect they might have on btc, namely making it go up, arguably bringing its valuation 'into balance' with where it should be, and bring balance to its volitility. The irony obviously if it did in fact bring balance, but the correct valuation was actually much lower, and in order to lower volatility it had to come down. Futures brought balance to the force of bitcoin by doing massive damage to it, lol. Just reminded me of Anakin, leaving the force in balance with two sith and two jedi, right?",1519872181,01/03/2018 02:43:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/811z2m/ever_wonder_if_btc_futures_was_the_phantom_menace/,0

question in regards to bitcoin as digital gold,"my interpretation of bitcoin as originally intended was a competing currency very analogous to gold, particularly in that it is essentially fully reserved banking and with a slow/predictable 'discovery' of new gold *used as currency*.

i'm confused by the fork of bitcoin and bitcoin cash in that i do not understand how the current view of original bitcoin has changed.  cash seems to go in in the same vein as my original understanding, while the original bitcoin seems to be spoke of as 'the new gold' but just gold as an asset or commodity, how it kind of sits today.  but i don't really understand this at all; where does demand for this new asset come from, what is the use?

1. why would there be a need to replace the old gold with the new one?  it is available for any who wish to get it and it's actually easier to do so than crypto.
2. actual gold has a history of money, crypto doesn't - so why use crypto?  it seems there is a belief that people liked gold and it became money, as so it will go with crypto - i believe this is a myth and the reality is that kings made gold coin of the realm to extract taxes.
3. gold has a function in a portfolio or a central bank; in a portfolio - back when money was backed by gold - it was essentially insurance in case the stocks did poorly - that would likely mean your gold did well or was at least stable.  essentially it was like cash or TIPS (inflation protected treasuries).  gold in central banks is deployed as a currency of last resort; it is part of reserves for a central bank to defend its own currency.
4. the one good argument i have heard is that it is accepted everywhere to exchange for other crypto - but isn't that simply the result of a first mover advantage; can't people code any currency pair trades that are demanded?  in this sense it is not analogous to gold, but more analogous to petrodollars (demand for the USD as most oil sold on exchanges is sold in dollars) - but only until other trading pairs become more popular?
5. it seems a ""new"" (only?) use case might be for only high dollar transactions, although with the complexity and volatility is this platform that big of a draw?  it's not simply supposed to be a large dollar western union competitor right?
6. is lightning network the expected answer to make all fees super cheap again and allow bitcoin to actually function as regular cash for stuff, and back to being a currency again?  i'm under the impression even under lightning that the blockstream team has a different vision of it?
7. this article was just posted in r/bitcoin; https://unblock.net/bitcoin-adoption-soars-africa-wake-increasingly-volatile-fiat-currencies/ but isn't the current state of bitcoin rather unhelpful for these people?
8. i presume all main developers are bitcoin rich, am i alone in thinking it is odd when roger ver asks them how often they buy things in bitcoin and it seems like once a month?  isn't the ultimate point of bitcoin to transact in it?  even if you expect it's value to go up, if you are bitcoin rich, why wouldn't you be making some more common transactions with it?",1519873125,01/03/2018 02:58:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8122na/question_in_regards_to_bitcoin_as_digital_gold/,0

Lightning Network and Proof of Work,"I'll explain some advanced things here.

Bitcoin's security and decentralization is because of his Proof of Work, the greater the bitcoin hashrate, the safer it is.

When you lose Proof of Work to earn zero and instant fees, you lose POW security and decentralization of currency.

So the Lightning Network comes to microtransactions, the good of the Lightning Network in relation to others is that its ballast is the very block of Bitcoin that is the strongest in the world and with a code well reviewed and tested by Bitcoin Core.

Only by SegWit itself along with Batch Transactions and in the future the Schnorr is already able to leave the rates in 1 sat / byte for a long time, since the three decrease the use of the blockchain.

Lightning Network will serve to keep zero and instant rate forever, without letting go of Bitcoin's Proof of Work safety.

CEX.IO I can't let you steal my 5500USD,"request# 651767
National Crime Reference Number: NFRC180202204185

CEX.IO stole my 5500USD(day39)


1. I sent 5500USD
2. CEX.IO said they will refund money. (FEB. 1)
3. CEX.IO said they sent the money successfully. which is LIE(FEB. 12)
4. CEX.IO said ""Your funds should have reached your bank account.""

5. My bank confirmed NO MONEY HAS BEEN SENT.
6. I asked them proof of money they sent, and they denied without any reason (because they are lying)

 
I was aware that there are many victims who claim that CEX.IO is SCAM.I thought they are weird people because I was fine using CEX.IO.I never thought this kind of SCAM would happen to me. 

###Since you(CEX.IO) have right to access the money.
###You should investigate this transaction. 

5500USD is my family's whole wealth.
My family is ruined out of your scam and irresponsibility.

It is not to late, you can send my money back now.  
I can't let you steal from me.
I will do everything I can.
I will not give up my money.

Summary of the latest Bitcoin document of the German Ministry of Finance,"[Link to document](http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Downloads/BMF_Schreiben/Steuerarten/Umsatzsteuer/Umsatzsteuer-Anwendungserlass/2018-02-27-umsatzsteuerliche-behandlung-von-bitcoin-und-anderen-sog-virtuellen-waehrungen.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1)

_______________________________
German summary:

Betreff: Umsatzsteuerliche Behandlung von Bitcoin und anderen sog. virtuellen Währungen; EuGH-Urteil vom 22. Oktober 2015, C-264/14, Hedqvist

- Tausch von Crypto in Fiat und umgekehrt: ""...steuerbare sonstige Leistung, die im Rahmen einer richtlinienkonformen Gesetzesauslegung nach § 4 Nr. 8 Buchst. b UStG umsatzsteuerfrei ist.""

- Verwendung von Crypto als Zahlungsmittel: ""...nicht steuerbar."" (*1)

- Folgefragen hinsichtlich der umsatzsteuerlichen Behandlung von Crypto in Bezug auf weitere Umsätze: Mining ist ""nicht steuerbar"", Wallet-Gebühren sind ""steuerbar und steuerpflichtig, soweit der Leistungsort im Inland liegt"".

_______________________________

English translation:

Subject: VAT treatment of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies; EuGH ruling from 22. October 2015, C-264/14, Hedqvist

- Exchange of crypto to fiat and vice versa: ""...taxable event, which is exempted from VAT to be compliant to the EuGH ruling with regard to § 4 Nr. 8 Buchst. b UStG.""

- Use of crypto for payments: ""...not taxable"" (*1)

- Further questions with regard to VAT and crypto: Mining is ""not taxable"", wallet fees are ""taxable and there's a tax-duty; This applies only if the service is provided within Germany.""

_______________________________


(*1) They don't explicitly refer to VAT at this point. So we have to guess: Did they want to say that it's exempted from all taxes including possible capital gains taxes, or is the whole document meant to be about VAT only, which is what the subject of the document would suggest.

How safe is Bitcoin in the case of the protocol being completely broken?,"Let's say that down the road someone completely breaks the bitcoin protocol. Someone finds a way to reverse the hashing algorithm and redo transactions, the Chinese government does a 51 attack, or maybe the network is DDoSed to its knees.

How resilient is the Bitcoin community and protocol against such a catastrophe?

Unless merchants start to discount BTC transactions over CC, I don’t see the adoption unless you are living hand to mouth.

"the philosophy behind the $1 wrench attack, and what it means for a society on bitcoin","hey there, let's talk about something for a few minutes, shall we?

we all know there is this ominous $1 wrench attack surface of bitcoin, people of the early days used it to jokingly point out that just forcing someone to give them your bitcoin is a very cheap attack vector.

so, if we have real value in this thing and no single actor can cheat this system, how exactly do you imagine a society if this becomes the prevalent global currency?

if you check history, you can see there was a time with real money (gold and silver coins) and look at how those societies were structured. people built fortresses and the times were much more violent.

now I have this theory, that our societies, and our prolonged phase of (relative) peace are because we relativized absolute monetary value with these spongy shady fiat systems, and the network of central banks we created. (well *we* did not create it, banks did)

now, think further. we live in the facebook age, we give up information at every step of our daily routines, only the fewest of us hold bitcoin really anonymously. most of us even have them on exchanges.

now, do you still wonder why banks are so positive on bitcoin? could it be that they know if they need to squeeze money out of it, or make it play by their whistle, they can just either manipulate the markets, or outright go after big holders, if need be with armies?

**the question I would like to ask: will times become more violent if bitcoin becomes a thing?**

really I am starting to regret already ever having people told  about bitcoin - what if they somehow lose their btc on an exchange hack but know I still have some?

my whole thesis is that real value causes real violence, and the reason we got so little of it is because we devalued most of our real values in our modern societies anyways. look around, we are all cosmopolitan, super tolerant and politically correct openminded open-data sheeple who hold their money insured by third parties.

none if this is real and is that the reason why it works?

what kind of society do YOU envision should bitcoin take off or take over? should bitcoin even take over or will it cause huge uproars and a little (a lot) of chaos before we achieve real change?

remember how presidential candidates always promise change? they know full well that actual change would be way more painful than anybody would like, but do we bit-coiners actually want real change? you know if bitcoin hits $1million or something in this region, there will be whole mafias going after people like loaded on bitcointalk who is worth about 40000 bitcoins last time I checked. how is society going to work in this case? is it even?",1519906838,01/03/2018 12:20:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/814uuj/the_philosophy_behind_the_1_wrench_attack_and/,1

Tested out a 1sat/byte fee just to see if it'd work...,"...And yeah, the transaction took 7 hours, but it is confirmed and done.  That's still less than 10% of the time a paper check would take.

Doing some quick math, the transaction was 189 bytes, meaning I only paid 189 satoshi in fees.  That's only 2 cents, which is less than 10% of the cost of a postage stamp.  Once again, this means that transacting in BTC is orders of magnitude cheaper than using a paper check.

Does this mean the fee crisis, and the scalability problem, are over?  No, but it does mean that 1sat/byte transactions are actually possible again, if you have one-third of a day to wait on it.",1519908043,01/03/2018 12:40:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/814yo3/tested_out_a_1satbyte_fee_just_to_see_if_itd_work/,14

"Fuck this dead end job, i plan to go all in with my savings.","Disclaimer: Long time lurker here. never bothered so far, but now made this account to make my first post and give my first thoughts because i made my decision.

I have a thankless dead-end job with a low to mediocre income. it's not even about the money anymore. fuck the money, that shit is secondary. it's the fact that i don't get any satisfaction working in a warehouse while my old schoolmates got semi decent cushy office jobs by just having good connections. they get to use their brains while i do the same repeptitive tasks over and over again. i even went to a private school to get better qualification and a diploma but i still can't get better jobs, due to lack of connections.

At this point it's evident that my life will never change for the better and i realize that unless i do something more radical, it will remain the same.

Fuck the greedy bankers and their FIAT and fuck the politicians who whore themselves out to the top 10 global companies to make the job market to miserable. now we have an influx of ""refugees"" that will be ready to work for an even lower income, fucking up the job market more because companies try to replace the human with robots. the future never looked so bleak for me.

i plan to go all in to cryptocurrencies, make profit and use the money to pursue activities that give me satisfaction (open up my own business, refine my programming skills..) without being tied to a stupid job with shifts because the CEO and the stupid fat fucks of shareholders can't get enough $$$$ no matter how well the company does.

r/Bitcoin recap - February 2018,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I’m back with the fourteenth monthly Bitcoin news recap.


For those unfamiliar, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in bitcoin over the past month.


You can see recaps of the previous months on [Bitcoinsnippets.com](http://bitcoinsnippets.com)

As first published on forbes.com

A week before Christmas, this headline about a random cryptocurrency no one has ever heard of was read more than most best sellers: Asians ‘Going Mad’ For Ripple Coin.  At the time, Ripple (XRP) was worth around a dollar. Today it is worth $2.45.

This will be the year that more unknown cryptocurrencies double in value.  How many will quadruple in value is anybody’s guess.

Sure, many of these new coins will disappear from the market. At their heart, the cryptocurrency craze is like the start-up craze, on steroids. Newly minted companies are going around the venture capital world, issuing their own digital currency, and having almost no problem at all finding willing investors. Got snake oil? No problem! Someone in Asia will take two bottles worth.

While setting up an initial coin offering is not cheap and needs upfront angel investing to foot the bill, the ICO market has turned what was once a half dozen cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin, into a $650 billion market overrun by over a thousand cryptocurrencies. These currencies are tied to new, unknown companies selling products and services no one has ever heard of, understands, and may have no real use for.
 As an investment vehicle, the cryptocoin is the market’s version of a poker chip. If you thought junk bond lords in the 80s were nuts…

Nuts? Oh, really?

The cryptocurrency bubble, if you will, has thousands of nutty investors laughing all the way to the bank. Literally.

If ripple coin has doubled in value, what are the odds of some other coins doubling too? Very high, in fact. Those odds are keeping investors looking down market at lower price coins. There is just too much upside, and no one has yet been willing to come forward to the press to say just how much money they’ve lost. The world is full of stories of people who lost all their money in their new business or saw half their life savings evaporate due to a crashing stock market or a financial swindle. But we have yet to meet the person who lost their shirt on a bitcoin bet.

And if their shirt is the only thing they are losing, then that’s not a cause for concern yet. Until investors come forth with big losses, the trend is your friend in 2018.

Tuesday marked the first trading day of the new year for American cryptocoin investors. Only three of the top 20 coins started off in the red.  Little known coins issued by startups like Tron and China’s NEO are up over 30% as of late Tuesday morning.

Tron is worth a mere six cents. China blockchain platform and Ethereum rival NEO sells for around $100 a coin.

Three years ago, one bitcoin was $15. It’s worth over $15,000 now. If one NEO is worth 3,000% more in 2021, like bitcoin since 2012, then it’s worth the gamble, most investors believe. A $100 loss isn’t putting anyone in the poorhouse.

Ethereum, an early entrant to the blockchain/cryptocurrency buildout, was created by Russian-born tech genius Vitalik Buterin. He’s now a millionaire many times over.

Another Russia,  Pavlov Durov, now residing in Dubai, is rumored to issue coins this year for Telegram, the messaging service most used in the crypto world. Durov did not return requests for comment at this time.

All someone like Durov has to do is look around him and see the money that is being made from nothing.

Nearly $3 billion worth of Ethereum’s ether coin was traded between the exchanges in the past 24 hours. The total market capitalization hit $84.12 billion, meaning this Russian developed blockchain is now worth around $15 billion more than Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, a company with over 60 years experience in the oil and gas markets, and one that actually has hard assets worth real money.

That’s no longer a viable comparison. Bitcoin and ripple are worth even more than Petrobras.  Bitcoin’s market cap is the equivalent of Chevron’s. Ripple’s market cap is just shy of Goldman Sachs’.

Alexey Ivanov, fund manager at Polynom Crypto Capital in Moscow, thinks unknown Ethereum competitor Cardano Cryptocurrency will double this year. It’s up over 500% since its ICO in late 2017. One coin goes for just $0.77.

“Once Cardano is added to a regulated platform, it can double,” he says. Volume is next to nothing on that coin because the blockchain infrastructure company is still working on so-called “proof of stake” coding to verify digital transactions.

Ethereum is currently working out the kinks in its own system, to help remove bottlenecks. Ivanov thinks that’s why the coin is up 17% on Tuesday.

David Herne, the American hedge fund manager behind the Specialized Research and Investment Group in Moscow, likes Waves, the Russian developed blockchain startup working with the Moscow Stock Exchange on a pilot program that would allow for trading in cryptos by qualified investors.  That coin goes for $13.21 today and already has a billion dollar market cap.

Buying cryptocurrencies is not liking picking a stock on E-Trade. E-Trade is like the intermediary between an investor and the New York Stock Exchange. There is no such comparable entity in the crypto world. Instead, there are many exchanges, some bigger and better than others.  Not all carry the same digital currencies, and the proof of identification process can day days if not a week to complete. Exchanges like Kraken and Bitstamp, which allow users to buy ripple coin, are spotty. (They were down both times I tried using them last week.)

“Call it a bubble if you like, but can you really afford to stay out of crytocurrencies?” writes Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist for ThinkMarkets in London. He posted his views here on Forbes.com.

* **Cryptomania was unquestionably the major talking point of 2017.  The question is: can you make money while still thinking there is a bubble? Giving a straight answer: if you can afford to lose an amount which won’t make any meaningful difference in your life, then by all means, dabble. An average American aged between 20-64 earns approximately $27-50K a year.  In the grand scheme of things, $100 invested in cryptocurrency has a minuscule probability to impact anyone dramatically. The rewards are undoubtedly there.“**

In 2018, investors are going to spend time discovering newer companies and their coins, especially those that do not cost the price of a new car (think Kia Soul, for instance).

As a result of this trend, bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency market has fallen to its lowest level in five years. As of now, bitcoin’s market cap is $233.6 billion, accounting for 36% of the total value of all cryptocurrencies. In January 2017, bitcoin accounted for 80% of all trading in crypto.",1519936199,01/03/2018 20:29:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/818g3q/article_from_viralpatchcomdouble_runs_crypto/,1

The Old Order Strikes Again,"I was a remote happy programmer. I live in a third world country, but I work for a company overseas. All was well until one day(TODAY) I receive a call from my bank about my monthly ""suspicious"" income(my salary). The call went more or less like this: ""Sorry your funds are being held hostage until WE DECIDE YOU ARE NOT A FUC**NG CRIMINAL. You have to fill a bunch of paperwork and possibly talk to a lawyer in order for the Government to know how to tax you the most. Thank you for your patience motherfucker."" 

So.. Until the slow, bureaucratic system decides I'm not a criminal, I can't pay my bills. My funds are frozen if not lost forever.  

This is the kind of power that needs to be overthrown NOW. 

This is why we need Bitcoin to succeed. And we will.

Quality research needs quality data: blockchain technology &amp; drinking water utilities,"Ever wondered which benefits blockchain technology could offer for (drinking) water utilities?

Well, this is exactly what my master’s thesis research @ KULeuven is about.

Based on a literature review and a round of exploratory interviews with 6 dedicated blockchain experts, I distilled a list of **12 possible driving forces** for the adoption of blockchain technology within the drinking water sector.

To make a future projection about blockchain implementation in this business sector I would like to **prioritize** these driving forces according to their **importance** and **predictability**. 

We all know decent research depends on good data, so I created a little survey to collect information from the blockchain community.

So, if you are proficient on Blockchain technology, please donate **4 minutes** of your time to my little research survey https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/K5DQKCS.

At what point will bitcoin and related cryptos become a successful rival to the fiat system … ?,"I’m somewhat sceptical and I think the following is needed, I’m interested in your views.

As currency:
-	Only when a **substantial** proportion of the population have their wages and salaries paid in bitcoin.
-	Only when it is possible and convenient to live one’s life with payment for **everything** using bitcoin alone.
-	Only when funds can be recovered after theft from a wallet or a lost private key.

As asset/investment:
-	Only when there is widespread trust and faith by **most** of the population in bitcoin as a competitive store of value.

The political project:
-	Only when the population votes in (or there is a coup) a libertarian government that will do away with fiat and banks.
-	Only when there is widespread acceptance by the public that the early adopters should rule the world.
-	Only  when there is widespread acceptance that cryptos or their proliferation will not cause either rampant deflation or inflation.

How to democratize mining,"I'm sure if someone would sell home grade mining hardware, people would buy and run it, simply to help the network. I know I would.
But what is a home grade ""I wanna help the bitcoin network"" miner?  It should be small, silent and highly efficient. 
A loud and huge antminer S9 makes 13TH by consuming 1.3kW. Nobody want this at home sitting next to the router in the hall. But a small &amp; silent box consuming 100W and making 1TH, why not? 
One million of this devices in the wild would make an exahash, roughly 5% of todays hashrate. 
Sure, so much distribution of relatively low hashrate, different network speeds and delays, would make the army of small home miners even less effective, but honestly: people wouldn't care. They are in to help the network. I can imagine many people would donate their earned btc fractions to a chairty of their choice, free software projects or BTC advocate groups or whatever.

TLDR: Hey you aspiring young BTC minig hardware producer, yes I am talking to you! offer me a highly effective small&amp;silent miner and I'll buy &amp; run it! ",1519940154,01/03/2018 21:35:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/818z9d/how_to_democratize_mining/,0

I dabbled in bitcoin like 7 or 8 years ago when it was $100 or so. Then in december and january they were suddenly peaking at 19k usd. 

Knowing reddit there would be a bitcoin subreddit and whadaya know there's people encouraging others to buy, hold, away with cash, boycott banks against crypto, keep holding, wait years to make profit. 

What stuck to me is that there was a point that there was a lot of discussion about how crypto is better than actual cash, it will replace and crypto will do away with banks. 

Why is this? I don't remember if there was an actual argument for this but I'm so confused to why this conversation became a thing on this subreddit. 

I ask now because the worth of BC has dropped and is slowly climbing and its hype is gone. Was this topic highly discussed to encourage and manipulate buyers/sellers?

Hey daytraders.,"I know good trading lets you accumulate. But one question. How do we want new money in bitcoin when everytime we hit a resistance all of you feel so smart  pressing sell at once. Sure it wont change but its frustrating the same people who say they want btc to achieve new highs are also so damn sure the price will not go up because it hit the resistance. You idiots are the resistance.

But what brightens my day is that for each day you guys sell a round number there comes the day when a big whale buys all those sell orders on the resistance and leaves you ""smart money"" having to rebuy higher or wait for the bounce back which never comes.

And I wish it to you all ""Bitcoin enthusiasts""

How fast can be done a passphrase diccionary attack?,"Hi, I wasn't able to find an answer to this problem, so I wanna ask you guys...
Say I have bitcoin HD wallet with 24-word seed and one-word passphrase which is from the same set of 2048 english words. Then I will fotget the passphrase and only will have the seed. How fast can I perform a diccionary attack? 
I suppose I need to generate bitcoin adress for every one of theese 2048 words and check for its content on the blockchain. But how fast is this possible to do?
In opposite extreme, I'm tring to find out, how secure the passphrase must be to be safe, even if somebody knows my seed and also knows that there is some passphrase attached to it.

BTC doesn't see block by block difficulty changes and the changes in BCH aren't that drastic adjustment to adjustment.

"If you were a juror in the LocalBitcoin trader Morpheus trial, these are the question the Judge would be asking you. (Something similar might go for SaltNPepper and NODEfather.)","**The Judge would be the instructions you would receive:**

&gt; This a criminal case brought by the United States government. The government charges  the  defendant  with  conducting  five  financial  transactions  involving  property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, which is a form of Money Laundering.  The charges against the defendant are contained in the indictment. The indictment simply describes the charges the government brings against the defendant. **The indictment is not evidence and does not prove anything.**                       
&gt; The defendant has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is presumed innocent unless and until the government proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the defendant has the right to remain silent and never has to prove innocence or to present any evidence.              
&gt; In order to help you follow the evidence, I will now give you a brief summary of the elements of the crime which the government must prove to make its case:                      
&gt; First, the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction;              
&gt; Second, the property involved in the transaction was represented by an undercover law enforcement officer to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; and  Third, either the defendant conducted the transaction with the intent to avoid a transaction  reporting  requirement  under  federal  law, or  the  defendant  conducted  the transaction with the intent to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the property.

**These are the questions that the judge will give the prospective jurors to answer.**

&gt; The Parties jointly submit the following proposed voir dire questions:                 
&gt; 1.What civic, social, fraternal, or professional clubs or organizations do you belong to?                  
&gt; 2. What magazines, newspapers and periodicals do you subscribe to?                  
&gt; 3.  If you follow electronic media, what blogs do you read and what podcasts do you listen to?                  
&gt; 4. Have you read or heard anything about this case other than what I have told you today?                  
&gt; a. If so, where did you read or hear information about the case?                  
&gt; b. Would that affect your ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?                  
&gt; 5.  Some of the witnesses in this case will be employees of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Scottsdale Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS or HSI) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Have you had any contact or experience with the FBI, the Scottsdale Police Department, DHS, HSI, IRS, or any other law enforcement agency that would affect your ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?                  
&gt; 6.   Do you have any strong feelings about the criminal justice system in this country, including feelings about judges, lawyers, police officers or other law enforcement agents, that would prevent you from giving either the United States or the defendant a fair hearing in this matter?                  
&gt; 7.   Have you, a family member, or a close friend had any negative experiences with the United States government (for example, an IRS audit) that would affect your ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?                  
&gt; 8.   Have you ever invested in precious metals, such as gold or silver?                  
&gt; 9.   Do you own, or you have ever owned or purchased, a virtual currency such as bitcoin, or do you know anyone else who has owned or purchased it?                  
&gt; 10.   Do you have any experience with blockchain technology?                  
&gt; 11.   Do you use, or have you ever used, encrypted messaging applications or software, or do you know anyone else who has used it?                  
&gt; 12.     Do you have any experience, training or education in financial services or regulations?  If so, please explain.                  
&gt; 13.   Have you ever worked at a bank?  If so, in what capacity?                  
&gt; 14.   Have  you,  a  family  member  or a close friend ever had any negative experiences with a bank (such as a home foreclosure) that would affect your ability to fairly consider evidence about banking rules and regulations?                  
&gt; 15.   In my brief summary of this case, I told you that this is a “sting” case, in which the defendant was communicating with undercover law enforcement agents.  Do you have any strong feelings about the use of “stings” or other undercover activities that would prevent you from giving either the United States or the defendant a fair hearing in this matter?                  
&gt; 16.   Do you have any religious, moral or philosophical beliefs that would make it difficult for you to render a judgment in this case as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant?                  
&gt; 17.   Do you have any religious, moral or philosophical beliefs that would make it difficult for you to render a judgment in this case as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant?                  
&gt; 18.   You are likely to hear that the defendant used a nickname or pseudonym—Morpheus Titania—in addition to his legal name. Will this information affect your ability to give the defendant a fair hearing in this matter?                  
&gt; 19.   You may have to listen to recorded statements in the course of this case that include the use of profanity in conversation by the defendant. Will this information affect your ability to give the defendant a fair hearing in this matter?                  
&gt; 20.   You  may  hear  evidence  that  the  defendant  is  generally  distrustful  of government entities and institutions. Will this information affect your ability to give the defendant or the government a fair hearing in this matter?                  
&gt; 21.   I  will instruct the members of the jury as to the laws to be applied in this case.  Would any member of the jury panel be unable to follow strictly the Court’s instructions as to the law, regardless of what you think the law is or ought to be?                  
&gt; 22.   If the United States meets its burden of proof under the law, would you have difficulty finding a person guilty because of your own personal beliefs or attitudes about a case of this nature, because of your sympathy for a defendant’s circumstances, or because it might otherwise be an unpleasant task?                  
&gt; 23.   Do you have any other beliefs, experiences, feelings or other reasons that you feel would prevent you from fairly deliberating in this case?                  
&gt; 24.   Is there any other reason you might not want to be a juror in this case?                  
&gt; 25.   Have you ever accessed the “dark net?”

"Central Bank officials visit Huobi exchange to understand the virtual currency operation, or its possible to the restart the exchange in China!!!","BTC123 Newsletter: According to foreign media reports, officials from the central bank's financial regulators in Shanghai and Beijing are investigating whether the country's exchanges meet the compliance requirements on anti-money laundering and capital controls. As the world's most hyped currency for the virtual currency, the People's Bank of China has started to walk into the country's largest digital asset exchange office to discuss issues with the exchanges' leaders. 

During the interview, COO Robin Zhu (Zhu Jiawei) revealed that the regulator started to deploy this step in January.  ""Chinese regulators want a full understanding of the importance of cryptocurrency trading: how Bitcoin works, where the money comes from, where the money goes, how people make money and lose money,"" said Robin. It is reported that the People's Bank of China also asked for information on the exchange volume and number of users. In addition to its platform data, Huntcoin regularly submits information and reports on global government policies to help the PBoC understand the industry. 

Robin thinks there must be something happening. To him, it seems that the central bank is gathering information to create a framework that exchanges need not over-worry about. Zhu Jiawei said that regardless of the policy will comply with the rules, it is likely that China will cancel the ban on currency transactions encrypted. 

In fact, at that time the two biggest exchanges in China, Hunt Coins and OK Coin, had ranked among the top 10 trading volume in the world. Since last September, the number of its staff has more than doubled to more than 400, indicating that the exchange is working hard even in the face of a rigorous regulatory environment.",1519954539,02/03/2018 01:35:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81aoxd/central_bank_officials_visit_huobi_exchange_to/,0

anybody else here own GBTC in addition to their bitcoins?,"who else wishes GBTC trades 24 hours a day like bitcoin?  

guess that's another reason why bitcoin is great.  it's so liquid at any time of the day.  

unable to change positions for GBTC when market is closed is so annoying.   I personally HODL bitcoins and trade GBTC like there's no tomorrow.

Several tax related questions,"This is my first time filing tax for my crypto investment. I have several stupid questions, and thanks in advance to anyone helping.

1. bitcoin.tax only gives me a 8949 form. But I'm a nonresident alien and my filing software only allows 1099 forms. Is there a way I kinda 'summarize' the 8949 and get a, say 1099-B form?

2. On a 1099-B form they ask for the payers EIN. I suppose that should be the EIN for coinbase/gdax or whatever exchange I am using, right? Where can I find this information?

3. I was stupid and made a bunch of trades in the past year. Can I just sum them together and just report the cost and proceeds of all the trades in one form?

"Just Started with using a bitcoin wallet, had a few questions.","edit: Unchecking 'Connect through SOCKS5 proxy' solved the problem.  It is syncing again.

I am using the Bitcoin core wallet, and I am having trouble synchronizing.  It has been stopped 11.90% for several hours.  Here is the message I have:
https://i.imgur.com/YmaWb4E.jpg
Now first, Is this thing downloading the whole block chain onto my computer? If so, is there a way to control where it downloads too?
Second, is there an easier wallet I should be using?  I already have some money in this one so my last question would be is there a way to transfer the wallet to another client, or do I just have to wait for this to finish syncing?

How do I sign a transaction with multiple inputs?,"I have a trezor and I would like to create 0 fee transaction(trezor wont let me do it with less than 1s/b). 

Yes I know the fee is too low, yes I know I cant broadcast this transaction and yes I know it might never confirm.

 In the trezor wallet there is an option for singing messages. If I paste a raw unsigned tx as ""message"" and sign it with the appropriate private key, would I end up with a raw singed tx? And even if that works, how do I construct a transaction with many inputs? I think I will have to sign multiple messages. But then how do I combine those into one whole tx? Thanks.

the treasure map!? Is it possible? Am I right?,"I had an idea about bitcoin mining or maybe we can call it reversing SHA256, that I'm not sure about it so I decide to ask your opinion. 
bitcoin mining has many steps and at the end, the header goes through two sha256 and the result compared with the target. the result of the first sha256 is 64 bytes that if we can find the collisions of this result for an available bitcoin we can mine another bitcoin. (one of my doubts) the header has 80 bytes that consist of 76 constant and 4 bytes (nonce) that change. the first 512 bits go first and the results use for the constant of the next block. if I am right, we have the answer for the first sha256 and the constants (H0...H15) for next message block of the first sha256 and the only variables are nonce that we could calc through step by step reverse of sha256 that I will illustrate after if all of this nonsense be true.",1519989773,02/03/2018 11:22:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81djxh/the_treasure_map_is_it_possible_am_i_right/,0
Food for thought: Why doesn't the Bitcoin protocol change to reward miners more?,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding, or maybe I'm giving people ideas that I shouldn't, but hear me out:

Now, this title might be misleading, since I am not trying to suggest that I think mining rewards SHOULD increase, I do not have the required expertise to suggest that.

However, I was wondering, why DOESN'T it increase? Since the Bitcoin protocol is open source, and subject to changes/developments and forks, based on 'community consensus' there is room for the protocol to change the rewards miners receive. And, since miners basically control the blockchain, since they ensure the propagation of the blockchain, why don't they band together and lobby for higher miners rewards? 

Or better still, why don't they develop a renewed version of the bitcoin protocol and force a hard fork with the majority of miners, basically forcing people to agree to their terms?

In other words, since in Bitcoin voting power == computing power, miners should be the rulers of the Blockchain. Why aren't we seeing protocol changes that favor their position?",1519989913,02/03/2018 11:25:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81dkbd/food_for_thought_why_doesnt_the_bitcoin_protocol/,0

Finding SHA256 collisions.,"if I want to illustrate briefly it would be like this:
we have the answer to SHA256 and we want to find another input to give this answer. 

* first a...h=answer-H0...H15

for finding previous a...h use these formulae:

* g(previous)=h
* f(previous)=g
* e(previous)=f
* c(previous)=d
* b(previous)=c
* a(previous)=b
* d(previous)=e-T1(previous)

T1 is a function of h(previous), e(previous), f(previous), g(previous), k(previous) and w(previous).    

T2 is a function of a(previous), b(previous) and c(previous).
the unknowns are h(previous) and w(previous) and we have one other equation.

* a=T1(previous)+T2(previous)

we have ""a"" and  T2(previous) so we can calc T1(previous).
so we have d(previous).

now we should guess w(previous) and use the T1(previous) to calc h(previous).

we repeat this method until we reach few first steps that constant are equal for any inputs and then instead of guessing the w(previous) and calculating the h(previous), we have h(previous) and use it to calc w(previous).

very simple but not sure if its work.",1519997127,02/03/2018 13:25:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81e64l/finding_sha256_collisions/,0

Ever wondered which benefits blockchain technology could offer for (drinking) water utilities?,"Well, this is exactly what my master’s thesis research @ KULeuven is about.

Based on a literature review and a round of exploratory interviews with 6 dedicated blockchain experts, I distilled a list of **12 possible driving forces** for the adoption of blockchain technology within the drinking water sector.

To make a future projection about blockchain implementation in this business sector I would like to **prioritize** these driving forces according to their **importance** and **predictability**. 

We all know decent research depends on good data, so I created a little survey to collect information from the blockchain community.

So, if you are proficient on Blockchain technology, please donate **4 minutes** of your time to my little research survey https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/K5DQKCS.

Here you can see some [Preliminary results] (https://i.imgur.com/NbRX2zI.jpg).

This guide assumes you’re a merchant who already understands the benefits and the risks of accepting Bitcoin. It's not technical at all. The goal is just to explain plainly what is BTCPay, how it works and cover advantages and disadvantages.

**What is BTCPay and why should you care?**

&gt; BTCPay Server is an Open Source payment processor, written in C#, that conforms to the invoice API of Bitpay. This allows easy migration of your code base to your own, self-hosted payment processor. [source](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver). 

The programmer behind the open-source project is Nicolas Dorier, Bitcoin Core contributor. Nicolas decided to fork BitPay processor and create a better solution. With BTCPay it's similar like with Bitcoin. You are your own bank; you control your funds, the payment processor can't just shut you down just because they do not like your business model. 

**Difference between the BTCPay and the third-party payment processor**

Think of BTCPay as a server which allows you to accept bitcoin without intermediates. The payment processors act as a server as well, but your customer's data, IP addresses go through them. 
Furthermore, most of the payment processors hold your crypto payments, and you’d have to withdraw it or convert it, similar to what exchanges do.
The advantages

**Benefits**

* You are running a full node and helping the network
* You are protecting the privacy of your customers 
* You’re using Bitcoin the way it’s supposed to be used, p2p, directly
* You’re avoiding fees that all payment processors have (monthly subscription/fees per transaction usually 1-2%)
* You can accept payments directly to your hardware wallet (currently integrated with Ledger very well) and you’re the immediate owner of those assets
* You can be a host and help other smaller shops accept payments through their stores
* You can accept other cryptocurrencies through BTCPay (Litecoin currently)
* You will be able to accept Lightning Network payments (feature still in development)
* Multiple merchants can have the same server and host their stores there, though this raises the issue of trust

**Disadvantages**

* It currently costs around 70$ per month (the cost varies depending on the server you’re using)
* It takes a bit more time to setup and configures to fit your store needs, (took 3-4 hours for myself, I’m not particularly tech-savvy).
* You can not convert to fiat currency right away like with some payment processors, though in my personal opinion, the immediate conversion ruins the whole point of accepting bitcoin and does not increase the adoption.

**ELI5 how BTCPay works?**

Currently, there are three basic elements of the puzzle :
* The server
* The plugin
* The wallet

You’re running your own server which has the full node running; the server is called BTCPay. Once installed it will be connected to your website subdomain. The plugin connects your server to your Woocommerce Store. In the plugin settings, you can set most of the stuff. A bit more advanced setting can be configured on the server. Your receive payments to your wallet (it’s possible to configure Ledger Nano S right out of the box).

This means that the buyer, pays directly to you in cryptocurrency and that the payment does not go anywhere else, the IP address is not leaked, the buyer data is not shared with a third party in any way. You will see the payment in your ledger wallet.

BTCPay is not the only solution to accept cryptocurrency directly, but after months of trying out, I found it the safest and the easiest to configure.


**Getting Started**

I am not nearly as smart as Nicolas Dorier who forked the BitPay plugin to bring us this payment system, so I will not go into technical details on how to set the server up. The entire document is [available on the Github](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver)

Summary of this step is that you have to register with Microsoft Azure server. Upon registration, you'll get 200$ free credits which will be enough for the first few months of for running the server, so basically, there are no upfront costs. Be aware that BTCPay is free; it does not cost a dime, you're paying Microsoft here for the server which will keep your node online 24/7.

After you buy the server, there is a single one-click deploy button you have to click. It will take you to your Azure VM and configure everything for you. There are few things you have to change yourself. Besides documentation, Nicolas made an easy to follow video for this. 

The next step is to connect your domain and your server, which is again very easy to follow up in the videos and documents.

The third step is to connect your Woocommerce store by installing the Woo plugin (plugin is free). 

The final step is to configure your hardware wallet and set the derivation path. I was amazed that Ledger configuration took only a few seconds. Nicolas did a great job with this one.

When you set up your store, it is highly recommended to test it out. Post any issues that you might find on the Github and if you have any questions, feel free to ask on Slack.

**FAQ**

Before I answer some of the questions I got from merchants, I'd like to tell that if you're a merchant and have any question, feel free to ask it here. If you're having trouble setting up your BTCPay server, [join the community on Slack](. There are developers and merchants there ready to help you.

&gt;Q: Where can I see the example of how BTCPay works and looks?

A: BTCPay website and if you want to see it live you can check my store

&gt; Q: Where can I get help/support?

A: BTCPay is an open-source project. The best way to ask questions is through the Slack group.

&gt; Q: Can the costs of running BTCPay be cheaper?

A: Yes they can. Currently, the one-click deployment requires Azure Virtual Machine, but if you’re a programmer or understand VM’s you can deploy one on a different VM. Furthermore, the changes in the latest Bitcoin Core and some tweaks that Jonas

&gt; Q: I have a Shopify store, can I use BTCPay?

A: At this moment, no. Shopify is a closed system a company opposed to an open-source project like WordPress, so it’s harder to communicate to them and create a solution. Luckily there are developers in BTCPay community working on it. While I can’t give you precise information, I assume it will eventually be possible.

&gt; Q: Can I have more stores connected to my BTCPay server.

A: Absolutely, you can host multiple stores on the same server. The stores can operate and configure settings separately and receive payments separately.

&gt; Q: Why use BTCPay vs. just having a BTC address up on your site?

A: The most important reason - the privacy of your customers and your business. BTCPay will generate the new address for each invoice. You just need to select the derivation patch for the address (in my case I used Ledger Nano S). The second reason is user-experience. BTCPay integrates as a payment method to your store, so you're customers can checkout with a few clicks.

I’m looking to buy quite a bit ($150-300K).  Want a brokerage that allows me to withdraw and deposit USD funds from a US bank, even though I have a Canadian home address. I know Coinbase doesn’t allow this, and I can’t seem to get my account verified with them as the two “verification amounts” they deposited keep producing an invalid amount error. I do have a verified account with Bitstamp, but I’ve seen many people on here complain about sending them wires only to have the money disappear.

A company with a large amount of activity is preferred so I can buy (or sell) at reasonable levels.

Am I being taxed on the value of my portfolio on the last day of 2017? (for crypto-crypto trading),"Hello everyone,

(Pertaining to USA taxes)

So I am under the impression that crypto-crypto trading is a taxable event.  I have a question though.  So- I did a lot of trading between BTC and alts when the price of BTC was 15K+ ... as a result I am being taxed on MASSIVE GAINS between BTC and alts, even when I did not sell to USD.  AND NOW my entire portfolio is down ~40%.  

Does the taxable gain amount cutoff on Dec 31st 2017? ie- is the value of my portfolio on the last day of 2017 the amount I get taxed on for crypto-crypto trading?  It seems very unfair as, yes I did make gains of about 15K USD (I DID NOT EVEN SELL TO USD) and now my portfolio is down almost 50% from where it was on Dec 31st 2017.  

So my question is- how is crypto-crypto trading considered ""realizing gains"" when I have since lost 50% of those gains and am being taxed on the gains as they were on Dec 31st 2017.  Its fucking bullshit ",1520025928,02/03/2018 21:25:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81igg3/am_i_being_taxed_on_the_value_of_my_portfolio_on/,3
Real-time transaction fee recommendation tools.,"In order to increase adoption, it would help if people got an accurate and up-to-date recommendation of the transaction fee. As can be quickly seen [here](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,2h), there are still many people overpaying the transaction fees. I searched for tools that give a recommendation the transaction fee, and I found these two links:

https://twitter.com/bitcoin_fees

https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/api/v1/fees/recommended

However, these tools are inaccurate. 

https://twitter.com/bitcoin_fees/ only updates every four hours or so.

https://bitcoinfees.earn.com is very inaccurate because it rounds to a multiple of ten (10,20,30,...). It also seems to overestimate the fees.

It would be great if someone made an API that gave an accurate and up-to-date recommendation of the transaction fees. As mentioned [here](https://github.com/jhoenicke/mempool/issues/32), going to [Jhoeniche](https://github.com/jhoenicke/mempool) website and taking the cheapest fee of the 1000s most expensive transactions in the mempool, seems to be a good estimation to get mined in the first block. Likewise, the cheapest fee of the 6000s most expensive transactions would get the transaction mined in approximately the first hour. 

Is anyone working on an accurate API for the estimation of the transaction fees? If not, I may start a github repository to do this... Is anyone interested in helping? We could simply have a full node that pushes into git every 2 minutes with the latest fee(s) and other users/devs can easily access it through github pages...",1520026019,02/03/2018 21:26:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81ih0w/realtime_transaction_fee_recommendation_tools/,23

BREAKING: Notice for Kraken clients funding through Japan: new funding instructions coming on March 21,"If you use our bank partner in Japan to fund your Kraken account for EUR, GBP, JPY or USD, please read this important notice. If you instead use one of our many other funding options, such as EUR SEPA payments (available in all SEPA-zone countries) or domestic USD transfers (available in most US states), or CAD (in Canada), you can safely disregard this notice. 

If you use our bank partner in Japan to fund your Kraken account with anything but CAD, your funding instructions will be changing soon - please check your account on March 21 for the new funding instructions. Deposits sent using the old instructions must arrive no later than 11:59 pm on March 20 Japan time (deposits arriving after this time will be returned). The new instructions will appear in your account on March 21 and will include new bank account details for sending deposits - please confirm that the bank account details have changed before sending new deposits on or after March 21. 

Why the change? 

Currently one of our banking partners in Japan services clients who reside both inside and outside Japan. Due to the strain placed on the bank by our recent exponential growth, this banking partner needs to narrow the scope of supported clients to maintain good quality of service. As of March 21 this banking partner will only service residents of Japan. Japan residents will send deposits to a different account at the same bank. Clients outside Japan will use a new bank. The new bank integration is still being finalized and this process may not be completed by March 21. Clients residing outside Japan who fund their accounts through Japan should be aware of a possible interruption in service starting March 21 (more on this below). 

Does this mean one of Kraken’s bank accounts is being closed? 

No bank accounts are being closed. If you previously received an email from us talking about bank accounts closing, please disregard it since the language is inaccurate and misleading. 

If you reside in Japan and fund through our Japan bank partner 

•	Your service will continue without interruption 
•	Make sure any deposits using the old instructions arrive no later than 11:59 pm on March 20 Japan time
•	Make sure you start using the new deposit instructions that will be made available in your account on March 21
•	You can continue to fund your account with JPY (domestic transfers)
•	You can continue to fund your account with USD, EUR, or GBP (international SWIFT transfers)

If you reside outside Japan and fund through our Japan bank partner with anything but CAD 

•	We are working on a replacement option for you so that you can continue to fund your account with JPY, USD, EUR and GBP transfers after March 20
•	The replacement integration is not finalized yet, meaning that there could be an interruption in service before the replacement option is ready
•	You can continue to make deposits through our Japan bank partner until 11:59 pm on March 20 Japan time
•	You can continue to withdraw through our Japan bank partner until 12:00 pm on March 27 Japan time
•	If the replacement integration is not ready by March 21, we will contact you with another announcement, and you will have the option to withdraw your funds until 12:00 pm on March 27 Japan time if you are concerned about the possible interruption in service

We want to emphasize again that no bank accounts are being closed. The story here is only about one of our many banking partners needing to narrow the scope of clients they serve to maintain good quality of service. The majority of Kraken clients, who use one of our many other funding options, are entirely unaffected by this change. We currently have a team devoted to cultivating new bank partnerships and expect to start seeing the fruits of this effort soon with new bank funding options coming online. For our clients residing outside Japan who have been using our bank partner in Japan, we expect to announce a replacement option for you soon, and will let you know if there will be any interruption in service.

Altcoin Season 3: Valued Projects?,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylIIJIDV7Dc&amp;t=0s

Hey Everyone,

The above attached link is the most recent Youtube video for Carter Thomas aka Coinmastery Tv. He talks about the impending ""alt season"" and offers his thoughts on how it will play out. Ultimately, he feels that we have entered into a time where everything will pump, but, the most valued, tried and true, best use case coins, will fair that much better. He ends the video discussing which coins the majority of people can agree on as being the best in terms of world wide adoption and use case. I wanted to make this subreddit to discuss those projects that we feel strongly about and that have a real use case and future on the blockchain. Twitter has become an epic shillfest, and although thats great, I really want more context and knowledge based ""shills"".

I am by no means an expert, however, I see real use case in supply chain projects, decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, KYC/identity projects, gaming, and distributed computation. Some of my favourite picks are: VEN, ICX, OMG, AST, 0x, NAS, KEY, POLY, QASH, QSP, CVC, WAX, THETA, GNT.

I would love to hear your thoughts and projects that you feel strongly about.

Thanks everyone, I hope you are all having a great day, evening, or night wherever you are.",1520026728,02/03/2018 21:38:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81ilof/altcoin_season_3_valued_projects/,1

"""Buy bitcoin. Rent everything else."" Bitcoin minimalism through bitcoin maximalism.","I have just been to a holiday in Bali, Indonesia. I went there to relax by the beach and practice surfing. While there I took a group surfing class. In the group I found a surfer dude from America.

This surfer dude and I hit it off and became great friends because it was clear that we were both interested in bitcoin.

We had dinner  afterwards where I learned that he lived according to the following motto: ""Own bitcoin and rent everything else."" He works as an analyst in Boston and owns no home, car, or anything. He has zero debts. His philosophy in life is to own very little except bitcoin and to only live off 4% of your bitcoin every year (he is applying the 4% rule normally used for stocks and bonds to bitcoin). He is a bitcoin minimalist in that he owns virtually nothing other than bitcoin. He is both a bitcoin minimalist and a bitcoin maximalist. It is a contradiction that makes sense. 

Afterwards we went to Ubud to do some yoga and eat vegan food. This surfer dude was picking up really nice slender yoga hippie girls and bringing them back to his hotel room. I was in awe of his confidence around women, and these were really nice girls. Of course he has already had a vasectomy. He claims that he wants to be childfree to help the environment. He even told the girls that he was childfree and a commitment phobe by choice and he is anti-marriage and the girls didn't seem to mind at all. They say girls want commitment, but this guy is anti-commitment by ideology and everyone respects it. 

I am not gay or anything, but I really admire this man and his lifestyle of complete and absolute freedom from all obligation and ownership. I want to live similarly but I have much more money invested in fiat (probably 80% fiat) and therefore I am not as wealthy as he is because he is all in bitcoin and has been since the early days of bitcoin.

It seems as if bitcoin gives you one single investment you can own. It is the perfect investment and it works everywhere and it is a global borderless investment free from corruption by governments. Everything else in life can be rented so that you live a life free of all obligation, responsibility, or commitment, a life free from all wage slavery, a life of complete freedom.

"19th of March 2018. I bring you ""The great bank experiment.""","Personally, I'm getting sick of how banks treat their customers or how they try to destroy the reputation of bitcoin by linking it to illegal activities when the top 1% are using offshore bank acounts to avoid taxes. There's also plenty of reports of banks closing down accounts or locking them down leaving people unable to pay their bills all because they wanted to trade some cryptocurrency. We pay their meals, not the other way around. This nonsense has got to stop!

Now I don't really know what impact this is going to have, but I'd like to try something. If I have a dream then I dream of a society where we have one currency, one language, one set of rules that isn't overly oppresive and is based on common sense that we all agree to follow, universal free education, universal free healthcare and free trade. I'm looking at posts like this https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/815w2c/the_pineapple_fund_is_using_bitcoins_to_transform/ and I see bitcoin has gotten us a lot closer to that. So why would we even waste our resources on banks and the politicians they keep as puppets and use to divide us? We're perfectly capable of managing our own money. In fact we're so good at it that we're actively improving the state of the world if we decide to do it.

I picked the 19th since I think it gives us enough time to get ready and spread the word...that and I like odd numbers.

On this day I want each and every one of you to go to your local branch or ATM and withdraw money. I don't care how much. It could be 10 or 50 or 100 or 1000 USD or whatever your daily withdrawal limit is. The point is we do it all together and we withdraw money that we normally wouldn't. Lets see how far this echoes.

If you're interested that's all you have to do. If you can tell others about it then please feel free to do so. There's 750k people here. If you each tell one person about it within the next two weeks while you're having lunch or something then there's going to be 1.5 million people that will be doing this. That's only if you just talk to one person in a whole two weeks. What if we added social media to the mix? Well I think we might just take back control of our money and we might then be able to use it towards something that actually matters.",1520037498,03/03/2018 00:38:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81kinw/19th_of_march_2018_i_bring_you_the_great_bank/,9

"What is preventing someone from making ""fake"" transactions to generate bitcoin?","I obviously am mistaken about something.

If bitcoins are awarded to those who process transactions, what is preventing someone from generating a bunch of transactions back and forth from two accounts to then be able to process those transactions and get awarded bitcoin.

I have control over AccountA and AccountB. One holds 1BTC and the other 0BTC. AccountA sends 1BTC over to AccountB. Then AccountB sends 1BTC to AccountA.

If this is repeated and processed over and over, the person who processes the bitcoin exchanges could mine them indefinitely.

If that's how that works. I'm sure it doesn't, but I don't see why not. Could some kindly explain this, or at least link me to some information as to why this wouldn't be the case?

One thing that I can see preventing this is if these exchanges are made and then approved all together, then the net exchange might only actually be 1 single transaction and the chump processing the exchanges just spent a ton of money for electricity.

Sorry, I'm kind of new to this.",1520041842,03/03/2018 01:50:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81l8c0/what_is_preventing_someone_from_making_fake/,0

using a Bitcoin node,"ok noob question here so I don't know if it even makes sense. 

I have a node running on one of my machines, forwarded the port and it appears to pick up 17 connections.

If I run python code on another machine to query the blockchain, how can I make use of my node?  Do I have to specifically point to it?  Do I even need to?

I'm not sold on a singular idea. So convince me!!!! I'm curious on what this community believes. 

Edit: Genuinely, I am interested in hearing new ideas, old ideas, all ideas. I think this subject is fascinating! 

Also: How in the world could someone (or a group of people) maintain such privacy in the digital age????

Question About Decentralization,"My understanding of the primary concern behind larger block size is that it would increase costs for full nodes. These costs would be a result of higher HD space requirements. And if less people could afford running nodes then we have increased centralization. (This may be wrong, so feel free to correct me)

My question: how big of a difference is the potential in centralization between increased HD costs to run nodes and the increased hardware costs to hash blocks (ie Bitmain increasing hashing dominance). And why?

I tried the Bisq decentralized exchange,"I exchanged some Bitcoin back and forth on Bisq to learn if it's anywhere close to practical already.

I am mesmerized by the attention to details, usability and stability of the software.

Bisq is a desktop application you are supposed to run (potentially) 24/7 to trade Bitcoin in a p2p manner.

There is no registration and no central server to connect to. Your order is active only when you run the software.

With Bisq you can exchange BTC to a few most popular national currencies (USD, EUR) or altcoins w/o intermediaries.

There is a built-in arbitration process if 2nd party won't behave. Selected arbitrator holds 1 of 3 keys in a 2/3 multisig scheme. The scheme includes security deposits to incentivize following the deal.

You can put your orders in relation to the market exchange rate (say +1%).

There are not so many offers and it may take a few days to get a deal. Or you can select one of the existing offers to get the deal outright.

My trades went through smoothly.

I highly recommend to give it a try if you value privacy and you are not in a hurry (and you shouldn't be with crypto trading): https://bisq.network/",1520082196,03/03/2018 13:03:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81q04l/i_tried_the_bisq_decentralized_exchange/,312

Hollywood should make a movie about Satoshi/Bitcoin,"How come there are no movies written/screened yet around Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin? I feel it would work as amazing content for not just one but many movies. I'm not suggesting documentaries/biographical movies, instead leaning towards action/crime ones.

I could see it attract a large viewer base. Both movie creators and the crypto-space would benefit from this. Most people are familiar with Bitcoin and crypto by now and this would only expand people's knowledge around this topic.

"We aren’t 16 either, but created a beautiful crypto tracking App which sends you automated alerts, news and shows you a toplist of all your crypto coins!","Hey crypto community,

We know that several people have recently launched projects similar to ours but still we want to take the chance to show what we have come up with for you over the last few weeks:

Our App is called [Coinance](http://coinanceapp.com) and it is so far available on iOS (Android launch in 3-4 weeks). Since me and my friend Felix both invested a some money into different cryptocurrencies, we caught ourselves checking market prices several times a day. Though most crypto websites like for example Coinmarketcap are still a bit rudimentary to use in our opinion. Since both of us believe into design disruption, we started to build a product for crypto currencies, which hopefully people love using and therefore make crypto currencies more accessible to a wider audience.

In our first version we tried to focus just on the elementary features as a market tracking app, even though we share a bigger vision behind Coinance. We tried to “build a fully working skateboard first, before shooting for a flying car.”

Our first and core features within the App are so far:
The toplist sorted by market cap. 
The ability to favorite coins in a separate view e.g. your portfolio. 
An alert function, which sends you push notifications once the price hits a target price and also once certain parameters are hit in our backend, e.g. all-time-high.
And finally a news section where we retrieve RSS feeds from news sites like .g. Coindesk, TechCrunch or Cointelegraph and share important Twitter news.

But where could this project go from here? We don’t know it yet, but we are curious to hear what you think! We believe in user centric development and have a couple of ideas of but we would love to hear from you what you actually want us to build next! Our thoughts are:

The ability to create your own portfolio and manually track your investments? Similar like Delta or Blockfolio.
Integration to several exchanges and retrieve their data about your current holdings into our App so that you could login and see your real portfolio. E.g. Mint for crypto
More News channels and sources to keep users up-to-date about ICOs.
Integrate an own wallet and becoming a possible future payment provider.

If you have an iOS device feel free to take a look at it yourself and let us know what you think. You can comment on here and we are trying to answer any questions / will take your feedback very seriously! 

Some of you guys might also be interested in who we are:

Felix is an UI/UX designer &amp; product manager currently still in his last semester of grad school. He designed the App, set the requirements and spoke with guys like you which features we should implement first. 

Mathias is a software engineer who works for a startup in San Francisco. He coded the App, but since you guys are very precise who exactly wrote ALL the code, admits that he had to ask one or two times a friend when he didn’t know it all himself. Booh! ;) 

*Note: This project is an evening &amp; weekend project, since Mathias is working full-time and Felix has to finish up his study. We built this thing for you - the community. We could also decide to spend our time differently, therefore please don’t be too harsh with your critique, but we really appreciate any feedback, suggestion or motivating words!*

Edit: The link to the iOS App Store was posted below in the comments but I'll put it here too. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to post it so didn't put it here in the first place: [Coinance in the AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinance-crypto-tracker/id1332598507?mt=8)

Researching My Lost Bitcoin,"So this story starts back in the day when 1440 dialup internet was what everyone had. I had a service called Juno. Juno displayed a permanent ad on your screen in return for free dialup internet. It prompted an interest in web advertising that led me to try out other similar things.

Years later, I found a site where you download this ad software that displays a permanent ad on your screen. In return they paid you in bitcoin. I remember it looked nearly exactly like Juno, but had a little digital money counter.

I used this on my home computer all summer. I remember checking it only to be disappointed to see I made less than $2 in 3 months. I can put a general idea on the time frame because I remember reading the story of the pizza-buying dude and thinking, in 3 months I didn't even make enough for a pizza.

I forgot about it and now have started the search for that computer. Does anyone know what that software might of been? Was it legitimate? Can I be one of those people who brags to their friends that they had and lost thousand in bitcoin?",1520102559,03/03/2018 18:42:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81s1r5/researching_my_lost_bitcoin/,0

New Data-Backup and portfolio web app!,"https://cryptocaseproject.com/

I've been a subscriber here for about 8 months now, and I've finally been able to contribute to adoption albeit in perhaps a small way.

I created a free and open-source web app to allow users to store private data (wallet seeds/partial wallet seeds) without needing to completely trust the server.

It uses a client-side encryption to cipher data before sending it to the server for storage. 

It also keeps track of public addresses, balances, etc. Please take a look, poke around, and let me know how it can improve!

Will Bitcoin support aliases?,"I've been doing some reading on various altcoins today and run into a concept which is pretty simple, yet, imo, could significantly improve Bitcoin's usability and adoption rate: aliases.   
   
In short aliases are like domain names for Bitcoin addresses. They are alphanumeric strings tied to an address and unique for the entire system. So for example instead of sending coins to 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy you could send it to SatoshisHotWallet. I think such solution would make it much easier to use Bitcoin and considerably minimise user errors.   
   
Seeing as this is being implemented for one of Bitcoin's forks it's certainly a feasible solution. Is something like this currently planned for Bitcoin? If not, can we raise a ticket to Bitcoin devs so it could be considered?",1520104670,03/03/2018 19:17:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81sa78/will_bitcoin_support_aliases/,11

Where is the revolution?,"I'm a writer working on a story about the inherent corruption at the heart of our financial world. I'd like to better understand the rise of bitcoin and crypto and how it offers a better and fairer alternative to the current way of doing things. I have some knowledge of crypto as I started buying and trading as an experiment in November last year, I'm also very excited about the potential for Blockchain technology, but right now I'm more interested in the ideology that underpins it all - the fundamental belief at the heart of bitcoin and crypto that it will change the world for the better. So I have some questions. Feel free to correct any misinformation or tell me if I'm missing the point completely. (And if there's a better place to post this then let me know.)

- If the rise of bitcoin is a revolution, then where exactly IS the revolution? I.e. who is driving it? I get that it's a collective effort and fundamentally decentralized but is there someone at the centre of it all setting the agenda and leading the way? 

- Who is the enemy? Is it simply the bankers? Does blockchain have the power to eradicate all potential corruption? You hear of fake ICOs and pump and dump schemes. Isn't everyone ultimately just out to make money?

- If not then what else can you do? Say somebody wasn't satisfied simply buying bitcoin and hodling, and they had the money and the means to do anything, what is the most extreme thing a bitcoin enthusiast can do to support the revolution?

Any input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Lightning network still needs a lot of work,"Let's start with disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of LN. I've been wishing for something similar since ~2012 (unfortunately I didn't have money to buy :/ ). I'm also very cautious of increasing the block size limit because of the cost of nodes.

So recently, I decided to try out LN on testnet. I started looking around and found that there are three implementations of LN: lnd written in Go, Eclair written in Java and C-lightning written in C, obviously.

My first step was to choose which one of them is the best fit. The intention is to run it on main net one day, so I decided to choose same constraints I would have chosen if running on main net.

I looked at lnd and found out it requires btcd - re-implementation of Bicoin Core. This is something many devs frown upon, but I was thinking ""maybe they use libbitcoin?"" I didn't found any information on this, so I decided to not risk it. Anyway, that would mean installing another node on my existing 100€ server, which barely handles one node with Electrumx.

Eclair was immediately out of question because of memory requirements of Java.

C-lightning sounded dangerous. C is very bad language for writing security-critical software. ""Why nobody wrote it in Rust?"" was my first thought. I learned only recently that a Rust implementation exists - one that's too far from complete and looking at the code, it doesn't seem very idiomatic...

So C-lightning was also out of question.

Or not. I was thinking ""maybe they have great test suite. After all, Bitcoin Core is in C++ (just as terrible as C) and it works"". That's probably the only choice for such a cheap node I have anyway.

So I cloned it and compiled. This was surprisingly easy. No messing with `./configure`, compiled pretty fast. I proceeded as instructions said and connected it to freshly-synchronized bitcoind. It seemed to work, so I opened a connections to two random nodes and created channels.

Then I was thinking that sending funds is boring, receiving is better. I quickly found out that those nodes I connected to put 0 satoshis into the channel, so they wouldn't be able to receive my payment.

So I tried to connect directly to the node with my phone using Eclair. It failed. I seemed to be out of luck.

Then I realized, I could receive money if I send first. Donating would be pointless, so I decided to simply buy an article from Yalls using my node. It turned out Yalls had screwed configuration, so I couldn't send them any payment. I tried to buy virtual coffee and the routing was giving ""too expensive"" error even for 5% fees.

During this testing, I hit few Segfault bugs - those are bugs that can also be serious security vulnerabilities and their presence demonstrated that C-lightning is doing well exactly what a typical C program is good at: crashing.

So I gave up for now. As you can see, there's a long way to go, so don't get over-hyped. And certainly **do not put a big amount of money into LN!**.

I hope this will change some day. It seems to be solvable, it just needs time.

TL;DR: Tried LN, it has lot of problems, had to give up. But I still believe in it's future.",1520106583,03/03/2018 19:49:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81shlp/lightning_network_still_needs_a_lot_of_work/,77

Lurker wants to confirm current state of affairs is recommended,"New to adopting Bitcoin, and I've been watching the sub for about a month now. I just want to confirm that based on what I've seen I'm going in the right direction.

First, I established an account on Coinbase for purchasing Bitcoin. I know there are several options out there, but from what I can see, this seems like an acceptable place to PURCHASE Bitcoin

Second, I've bought and setup my Trezor. I have transferred my Bitcoin to the Trezor (Fees were very low. . . from what I've seen regarding SegWit, low fees on Bitcoin is a relatively new thing)

Last, I will continue to purchase Bitcoin and store them on my Trezor. 

Are there any glaring issues with my current setup and plan? I don't plan on any day trading. I currently plan on hodling so that once wide-scale adoption has occurred, I have a sizable amount (relatively speaking). In the meantime, I will only spend Bitcoin if a place that I would normally do business starts accepting them. I want to help with the wide-scale adoption, but I don't want to go out of my way to spend Bitcoin at a place where I wouldn't normally do business.

How can I accept Btc as a payment method?,[removed],1520125356,04/03/2018 01:02:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81ugkq/how_can_i_accept_btc_as_a_payment_method/,1
Any way to get a reasonable exchange rate in BTC for gift cards?,"I have looked on LocalBitcoin, Paxful, and several other sites that offer such exchanges but the exchange rates they offer are insane. 

On average i'm seeing offers of around 30% the value of the card in BTC and the best offer i have found  was about 40% while there are several offers for under 20%.
This means that at best i can expect around $40 worth of BTC for a $100 gift card. 

These prices strike me as huge red flags, who would do this if they acquired the gift card balance legally? With those rates i imagine the only interested parties are dealing in illicit funds. No one in their right mind would take a 70% loss to buy BTC. 

Am i missing something here? is there a place i can get a reasonable rate for my gift cards in BTC, i'm thinking no more than a 30% premium at most.

so i have started to hodl bitcoin last year and now i am back to see what i got. but as i am investigating there is hundreds of alycoins out there. and i investigated more where i came across a point there are different btc prices on different platforms. i am buying btc from middle east which is around 11.000usd atm. but on us its 11.500usd. which seems an ok difference but sometimes it can go up to %20 and i could not understand why there is a huge gap in the first place. i know everybody just buying and selling on different platforms and the prices goes up and down accordingly but %20 difference is huge. and why does this much difference appears in the first place?",1520159789,04/03/2018 10:36:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81wzx8/question_aboutdifferent_prices_on_different/,2

Mentioned the drop but also pointed out its sustained growth dispute that drop.

The only criticism I have came from two bad quotes from a guy with the Digital Currency Group.

He said ""bitcoin is an investment"" . That's wrong. It's a protocol. This is what it really is and it's a very important thing to realize as the IRS and your accountant attempts to figure out how it should be taxed.

He also said "" you will either make a lot of money or you will lose all your money"" . That's completely wrong.  Bitcoin will never be worth nothing, anymore than an ounce of gold will ever be worth nothing. People need to stop saying that. It's false and people in the industry especially should know better.

Throttle Bitcoin Core's bandwidth usage,"Does anyone have a solution to the crazy upload usage of running a full node?  I'm fine with uploading at 2mb/s 24/7, but anything more hits my bandwidth hard, and I start seeing significant slowdowns.  I haven't seen an option in Core to throttle this, and there's nothing online as far as I've found other than third party programs to limit specific apps. 

Any ideas?  Since v16 came out my upload speed has been going crazy for people re-downloading the blockchain.

Requesting advice on transferring Bitcoin from a pre-Segwit Electrum wallet to a post-Segwit Electrum wallet,"Hi all,

As stated, I have some old Bitcoin lying around that I want to move. As it currently stands I have this Bitcoin stored in an old Electrum wallet that is roughly 2.5 years old. Before I go and cowboy my funds I thought I would ask for advice here first now that the fees are low enough to move them comfortably.

I am wanting to use the following set up:

- A new post-Segwit wallet for my BTC

- A new hardforked wallet for my BCH

- The potential to reimport the old keys into any new forks of BTC (i.e Bitcoin Unlimited etc)

From there I will move my funds from the old address to the new address. After I have confirmed they have landed in the new address I will import the keys into a BCH wallet to keep them completely separated.

Regarding the steps for transferring the funds themselves, are there any important steps that I need to be aware of to avoid sending my coins into the ethos?

Thanks for your time.

Legality of Bitcoins in Belarus,"According to the decree number eight, named ""On the development of the digital economy"", which will be enacted on 28 March 2018, using crypto-currencies in Belarus are declared legal providing Belarusian will be processing all their digital money transactions through residents of government's controlled special zone for IT entrepreneurs ""High Technological Park"".

This zone, launched in 2015, contains around 200 startups companies, which enjoy various tax and legal allowances from Belarusian authorities. Mining and trading crypto, organizing ICOs as well as serving as go-between all other citizens and the crypto-world are now added to this list of government's backed privileges. Additionally, all those crypto related activities will stay tax exempt until 2023.

Looks like Belarus has just joined the long directory of countries where ruling elite wants to closely monitor and to control people's access to the new free and borderless economy.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: not friendly;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: mobile e-services, SaaS, entertainment;
major limitations: government regulated stagnating economy (GDP growth rate is slightly above zero), high CB interest rate (exceeds eleven percents, high administrative and legal barriers to SME, brain-drainage, fixed Internet penetration rate is around 60%, shortage of seed and VC financing, low middle-income consumers (per-capita is below six thousands dollars);
stimulus: low costs, low competition, population is about ten million;
opportunities: to create an e-business aimed at the young urban users of mobile Internet.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): limited legality (moderately negative)

ELI5 what happens in these extremely improbable events?,"So I spent the day brainstorming everything that could possibly go wrong with bitcoin. Here's what I came up with.

**Super Hard Fork** A big fraction of the world's mining power is in Iceland, which is connected to the rest of the internet by two or three submarine cables. Suppose an attacker were to sever those cables in a way that would take a few days to fix. In the intervening time, every node in Iceland would only be able to connect with other Iceland nodes, and vice versa. In that time, could the attacker enact a double-spend on both networks? If so, how would the fork be resolved when the Internet connection was restored?

**Different kinds of forks** Pretty much anyone can fork Bitcoin by making a their own set of protocols. If they make a new coin, they can also decide how transactions for the new coin are signed. 

Suppose I forked Bitcoin into a new coin called BitcoinScam.However, instead of using the SHA algorithm to sign, BitcoinScam signs transactions by multiplying the private key by 1. Or some other way algorithm that, combined with the regular Bitcoin signing algorithm, allows them to somehow deduce the user's private keys. Is this a realistic way to hack gullible users? Or does the math not work this way? ",1520222210,05/03/2018 03:56:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82373w/eli5_what_happens_in_these_extremely_improbable/,5

Cashing out all my BTC,"Hey guys, 

I've been on this journey for about 4 years when I bought about 100 BTC at 1k and held on for dear life (before HODL was even a thing). It's time for me to cash out. I finally have enough to buy my parents and family the house that they've always wanted. 

I need the money really soon and I was wondering what the best way to turn that amount back into USD would be. I'm not sure if this matters but my BTCs were originally purchased on Bitstamp, coinbase, and I received a loan repayment in BTC. 

I'm wondering what I need to do to get this money into a bank account in USD as quickly and safely as possible, the deadline on the house is coming up this month. 

(I have never cashed out any money through an exchange and I'm not familiar how long that usually takes)

Thank you for any help!

If you’re in the U.S., Australia or the U.K. and you’re not keeping a record of your capital expenses then you’re basically throwing money away.

Using the 12 word mnemonic.. What are the odds of changing two words with similar meaning and enter a different wallet?,"So I am in a bit of a problem.

I noticed bread updated its ios app on my phone. Launched it to see what has changed... App asks for the pin. I usually use touch Id to enter..  So at first try entered a wrong pin (apparently.. As the app locked itself for more than 24hs for security purposes). Chill... I wait a day., enter again and try my second pin option (I'm 100% sure one of those two was correct). After enter the pin.. App says it's wiping the wallet. 
OK..  I will have to use the 12 word mnemonic to restore the wallet...
I have stored the 12 words in a poem I made up and on a different language than the original words. So I started entering the words... Invalid... Two of the words have some ambiguous meaning so changed one...nop.. Two.. And I'm in!

But.. Funds are not showing. OK... Probably bread need to sync the blockchain... But after syncing they are still not there... No transactions... Nothing. So..

Crypto over Cash...,"So crypto currency relies on a network to run. A transaction is verified before being confirmed. Confirmation groups (Nodes) require electricity or some other energy supply and have the be connected to the internet to function to the best of the ability.


My question is, what happens when the power supply is suddenly lost?

Not being alarmist, but what allows cryptocurrency to function when a global blackout occurs? For example, solar flare related, natural disaster related. No power makes it so transactions can not go through with the network.

What prevents people from using EMP pulses on nodes or mining facilities?

The majority of global currency is located on the internet, and is virtual bank balances, but we still have cash available. How does cryptocurrency compete with this in times of struggle?  Or is that traditional currency methods have the one-up over cryptocurrencies.


Are these questions valid, or am I missing a key concept?

Here's how to send a bitcoin transaction if you dont have internet connection,"Let's say you are travelling and you dont have mobile data or for some other reason you cant connect to the net but you want to send someone some btc to buy something. 

Obviously you can't broadcast a transaction with no connection. But if you have a wallet that lets you sign a tx (like mycelium or trezor for example) there is still an option. 

Use your wallet to sign the transaction and copy the raw tx.(it looks like a long string of numbers and letters a through f)

Then send an SMS to this number 
+32 460 213 730
Paste the raw tx in the message field.

Once you hit send your transaction will be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

Edit: There is a US number too:

Conbase,"Requesting help from the Reddit community voting this up so that Coinbase can be held responsible for not locking people out of their own accounts making it impossible to trade.

I had purchased some BitCoin on Coinbase over a year ago (I think).  I had not logged in for some time and had since replaced my laptop and phone, from which I had authenticated.  Now Coinbase will not give me access to my account without authentication.  The only way that they can authenticate me is by sending me an email and after about 20 attempts, I have still yet to receive the email to authenticate.  Similarly, I am trying the path of ""forgot my password"" to see if I can gain access another way and that too is failing to generate an email.

I have opened a ticket with Coinbase about 3 months ago and have waited on hold for 2+ hours on about 8 occasions.  On the 2 occasions that I got through, I was told that my case was escalated to the top priority (they called it priority 10) and that I'd be hearing back from someone (not by email) shortly.  That was 5 weeks ago and I've heard nothing since, despite many subsequent emails to them.  I have sent them a letter from my attorney and still no response.

To make it worse, I used to get email from them at this same address and I am still getting emails from them to the exact same address asking me to complete a survey about the quality of support.

Please help me get Conbase accountable and to get me access to my shares.  I'll likely never recover from the inability to have sold when I wanted to and buy when I wanted to, but the least I wish is to regain access to my account.  Please help me to escalate the attention this gets!  Thank you!

I made my transaction on 2018-03-05 13:14:12 to 15y2L6oCLRRzgJTmNmtYGPLyFf74WJaJ6z. At this moment the deposit transaction is still pending with 0/2 confirmations.

https://blockchain.info/address/15y2L6oCLRRzgJTmNmtYGPLyFf74WJaJ6z

Now it's 20:13.

I withdrew the Bitcoin from KuCoin. The fee was 0.001 BTC.

How long can this take?

The question I have is also if I can expect my transaction to be arrived tomorrow, 24 hours from now. P.S. What are those other addresses I see? They are unknown for me.",1520277190,05/03/2018 19:13:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/828g6m/why_is_my_bitcoin_deposit_stuck/,0

"GoFundMe and KickStarter, but instead Bitcoin","I had an entrepreneurial thought this morning. I just want feedback of all sorts -- negative, positive, neutral, or if you've seen sites like this before just point it out to me.

---------------------


**Introducing [INSERT_STARTUP_NAME_HERE], the cryptocurrency equivalent to GoFundMe and Kickstarter.**    

Users can donate for a cause, or just for any reason(maybe even none).

But unlike any other fundraising platform, the only payment method is entirely ~~cryptocurrency only~~ Bitcoin only*.      

This fundraising platform has a secure escrow, so you won't be sending directly to the recipient(unless you choose to).

---------------

Hopefully, if this idea actually comes to life, I'll make it automatic so I won't have to manually monitor the escrow balances and payout manually.

Oh, and identity verification is of course needed if you want to withdraw!

[Canada] Bank of Montreal (BMO) to block cryptocurrency transactions through BMO Credit and DEBIT cards including Interac Online Payment.,"I have a friend who works at BMO and they sent me this email they received this morning from their manager.   
______________  
  
**Background**  
Currently, customers have the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin through an online cryptocurrency exchange. Just like foreign currencies customers are able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies by setting up an account through a cryptocurrency merchant website. These merchants are set up to accept different methods of payment and once transactions are completed, cryptocurrency is stored with the merchant in a ""cryptocurrency wallet""  
  
**What's new:**  
Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and to better protect the security of our customers and the bank, BMO has made the decision to block cryptocurrency merchant transactions effective March 1st for BMO Mastercard transactions (both debit and credit) and Interac Online transactions shortly thereafter.  
  
This block includes transactions processed via a BMO MasterCard credit card (including Small Business credit cards), BMO Debit Mastercard and BMO Debit Card (using Interac Online Payment)  
  
**For Credit Cards and Debit Mastercards:**      
* Customers attempting any transactions will be blocked and presented with a message advising the transaction cannot be completed within the site or App being used to purchase the cryptocurrency. Customers signing up for the first time will not be able to use their BMO MasterCard or their BMO Debit MasterCard to register.  
  
**For Interac Online Payment Service**    
* BMO will debit the customer account temporarily and when the finalized transaction is being sent from BMO to the merchant, the transaction will be blocked and present the customer a message advising the transaction cannot be completed. Any funds will be automatically credited back to their bank account within 30 minutes.  
  
**Action Required**  
* If customers ask why they can no longer make cryptocurrency transactions with their BMO Credit or Debit card, let them know that BMO is taking a proactive approach to protecting our customers' accounts by blocking merchants who are considered high risk.  
* If customers have completed a cryptocurrency transaction which has been blocked using the Interac Online Payment service. let them know they will receive their funds back in their account within 30 minutes. They do not need to do anything to have their funds returned.  
* If the funds are not returned to the customers, follow the escalation process outlined  
  
 _________  
  
Well, there you have it, folks. BMO has joined TD to block customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies. It's understandable that they'd block credit cards because people are betting with the bank's money, I'm surprised they also blocked debit cards along with Interac Online. It's getting harder and harder for Canadians to take part in the cryptocurrency scene.

    // which has units satoshis-per-kilobyte.

    // If you'd pay more than 1/3 in fees

    // to spend something, then we consider it dust.

    // A typical txout is 34 bytes big, and will

    // need a CTxIn of at least 148 bytes to spend:

    // so dust is a txout less than 546 satoshis

So now it fits, with not much room to spare, but it fits. So my question is:

Can I prune this new blockchain now, to create more space on the pc, and then put in my wallet.dat file in this pruned blockchain and it will all load up faster....will that work or will it need to resynch the whole blockchain again anyway because it needs all the info?

My outlook at the double rejection,"Bitcoin has just been rejected again from approaching 12k levels. This heralds a low that will most likely extend below 10k. I'm hearing a lot of predictions, so do your own research.

Bitcoin transactional volume is way down (this has nothing to do with Segwit) and so is the trading volume on crypto exchanges. I think that recent price movements have been driven by market expectations rather than adoption realities, and this is why the market keeps struggling with 12k resistance. Until we see massive adoption and real-world use cases, bitcoin will remain in a bear market. Speculative interest alone can't prop the price up to 11k.

However, the future is still bright. Now is a great time to sell at a profit or marginal loss, and buy back in lower.",1520298917,06/03/2018 01:15:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82b5r3/my_outlook_at_the_double_rejection/,0

Legality of Bitcoins in Belgium,"Belgium government bureaucrats from The National Bank of Belgium (NBB) and the Belgian Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority (FSMA), which are responsible for forming country's financial politics, have more than once expressed their strong disapproval of all crypto-currencies, which fall outside of their own strict oversight.

They are joined by the Federal Public Service Justice head, who, after two cases of Bitcoin seizures had been revealed to the public by local press, called to strengthening of governmental control over all forms of digital money.

Such hostile predisposition of Belgian finance and legal gatekeepers towards crypto leaves little doubt that, although there are not yet specific regulations regarding digital money in Belgium, it's just a question of time before Belgium lawmakers lay their heavy hands on Belgium fledgling crypto-community.

Bitcoin on the top of the world!,"Hi guys,
My name is Atanas Skatov, keen mountaineer and vegan. After climbing six of the fourteen 8000+m peaks this year 2018 my next goal is to climb Mt. Cho Oyu, 8200m, and again Mt. Everest, 8848m, just by myself, no sherpas and artificial oxygen. 
How do you find the idea of waving the Bitcoin flag on the top of the world? Plus on another peak at 8200m, Cho Oyu?! 
Your sponsorship or donation will be fully appreciated. Anyone wishing to embark on climbing Everest and Cho Oyu summits and contribute to the expeditions with Bitcoin support is welcome to make a donation or even sponsor the mission. Thus you will see how all my equipment will have the Bitcoin logo which will be seen on all photos and videos during the two expeditions as well as in the documentaries about them. The book that will follow both expeditions will also stress on your valuable support and encouragement. 
Just imagine enjoying the breath-taking views during this once-in-a-lifetime experience of my spectacular expedition with Bitcoin!
A few words about me – I am the first vegan in the world who have climbed Mt. Everest in 2014 and the first vegan to have climbed the Seven Summits, as well as the first vegan in the world to have climbed Everest via both the South and the North ridge routes. Within 3 years I managed to climb 6 summits over 8000 meters in total and within 5 years I did 15 expeditions with no athletic or mountaineering experience before. 
More about my project on:
http://www.atanasskatov.com/index.php/project

More about me: 
http://www.atanasskatov.com/index.php/about
My mission is to inspire people to protect our planet by reducing animal products consumption. Let us all act together to protect our planet and make the world a better place with Bitcoin!
The sponsorship needed for both expeditions, Everest and Cho Oyu, is 3 Bitcoins. Thanks to Bitcoin they can turn into reality.
LET US BE TOGETHER ON THE TOP OF THE WORLD!
Please follow the link for your support:

Mining Bitcoin on Dorm Electricity,"I hope I'm not breaking any rules in this post.

I don't pay an electricity bill, and I effectively have free energy at my hands (for reasonable power consumption). That's about the only thing I have for free. I recently had to pay $120 just to access engineering homework online for a single class. If I unethically mine bitcoin on dorm electricity using several gaming laptops running overnight, could I expect to recoup some of that book money or at least few bucks a day for food running full-time? I've been looking for some insight about this and can only find responses about how GPU mining is a waste of time and yields no profit, which I understand would be the case due to the electricity cost. Surely the revenue is still non-zero though?",1520328688,06/03/2018 09:31:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82dtok/mining_bitcoin_on_dorm_electricity/,6

Do you buy goods and services with Bitcoin? Or do you Sell your Bitcoin for goods and Services.,"Just a thought on how buying and selling are interchangeable, and when you buy bitcoin an unavoidable equivalent event also happens.
For example: 

Bob buys a car from Alice for $5,000.
This can be re-written as;
Alice buys $5,000 from Bob for a car

I thought this as I saw a comment on a mainstream news article about bitcoin, the commenter was saying that anyone who bought bitcoin in 2010 would be selling it all for USD and this means that Bitcoin will eventually fail as everyone wants to sell for Fiat. But what is happening as well, is that dollars are being sold for bitcoin. Just like some Real Estate investors buy bitcoin for Penthouses in Dubai.

I guess my point is; neither buying or selling should be emphasised, more accurately, a transaction or an exchange took place.

I'm sure this observation has been made hundreds of times before, but worth repeating I feel. ",1520330665,06/03/2018 10:04:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82dyqi/do_you_buy_goods_and_services_with_bitcoin_or_do/,11

It doesn't matter what price Bitcoin holds as long as it's stable,"That was the argument a lot of economists/bankers had for a long time. I'm not vested in any coin, I tend to look at things from an objective point of view. 

In the last 2 weeks, Bitcoin/Dollar parity is relatively stable. I'm sure some people can bring all sorts of moving average charts, candle charts etc. and analyze it in detail and shine a better light on this. I'm only posting this because it's not talked about widely enough and this accomplishment should be recognized for what it's worth. 

I think people should stop worrying about the value increasing or decreasing and they should encourage businesses to implement cryptocurrencies as a method of payment. 

There is one tiny problem though. The moment any limited coin is adopted by a company, there is all the newsflash  reports and people start buying with the anticipation of the price increasing and not spending it. Then instead of spending and using the coin everyone starts hodling and the narrative changes to Mooning. It never moons because now it's not used as it's supposed to and it's not actually adopted as a payment method by BTC owners. 

Central banks issue more coins as their countries economy grows to fight inflation. Bitcoin will always be stuck at 21 million. You can argue that there is always Satoshi, which is the actual currency mentioned in the White Paper. That is irrelevant. Because as long as the coin has potential to increase in value, it won't be spent and used as a currency. That is the reason why people never used gold to buy anything. 

At one point community has to decide, if they want to moon or use it as a currency. I think that is still unclear. You fundamentally cannot have both. 

Going back to the stable USD/BTC parity; I think this is a healthy sign of BTC becoming a currency and hope people decide to use it as a currency now instead of HODLing an claiming that's what the coin was meant for. i think 200 Billion is a healthy cap in digital currency, which is actually being widely used. Daily volume is about 3-4% of that. We have a lot more room to go without the price inflation despite increased velocity. 

One last note. I think people should also look at the value of coins in Euros. In the last 12 months USD has lost 20% of it's value against dollar. Just to reinforce the forex mentality of BTC or any coin, we should talk about it like one and analyze it as one. Comparing a digital coin to one currency is useless.

What if governments or banks going to control mining companies?,"Governments or the worlds central banks have enough money and power to buy or maybe force large mining companies (or pools) to cooperate with them.

The whitepaper reads:

&gt; The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.


Having the control over the largest mining companies should not directly mean to attack the network, however, could this lead to some sort of control over the Bitcoin network in a negative way?",1520370627,06/03/2018 21:10:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82ilwh/what_if_governments_or_banks_going_to_control/,0

What is the best way to deal with banks when cashing-out a low six figure amount?,"At some point this year (when the BTC price has risen), I plan to convert BTC into fiat. I am in the UK. I intent to obtain the £ equivalent of about $200,000 of fiat. 

My question is whether I should contact my bank to tell them that I plan to make a large deposit. Is it good policy to inform the bank in advance? If they asked for the source of funds, I would be honest and tell them it’s from buying and trading crypto-currency. 

My concern is that the bank will think a large deposit is suspicious and freeze or close my account. Hence, informing them in advance might be helpful. (Or it might not – I don’t know how banks interpret this situation).

This is not a question about taxation: I will pay the Capital Gains Tax (CGT).

I know which UK exchange I will use. I’ve used them before. This part does not bother me. 

I will cash-out a percentage of my BTC. I will keep more. 

I’m just wondering whether anyone else did (or did not) contact their bank when cashing out a low-ish six figure sum. What happened (if anything)? Thanks.

It's liberating when you realize that no one actually has a clue what they're talking about regarding this market.,"I got into crypto almost a year ago. It's been an incredible experience learning about Bitcoin, blockchain, and other cryptos. While it's game-changing technology and a potentially great investment, it has also been a tremendously fun hobby and given me countless hours of reading, entertainment, learning, and even new relationships. It's awesome to see this community growing at the pace it has and I hope to see it continue long into the future because this is something I'd like to stay involved in for the rest of my life. 

With that said, the amount of bogus information and speculation on Reddit regarding the crypto market is painful to endure. For those that are newbs, which I still in some ways consider myself pretty new to this, it is easy to get caught up in the forecasting and high or low expectations for Bitcoin and other coin prices. Everyone obviously wants to see this market continue to boom, and positivity is a great thing. But there is a big difference between positivity and downright bogus speculation. The same goes for those that predict bear markets and crashes. The uninformed predictions of the market plummeting are no different. I may be overshooting this a little, but I'd say that more than 99% of what I read on Reddit regarding the market falls into the bogus speculation category. That is not a good look on cryptocurrency as a whole. We need to be realists, and the reality is that being a realist about crypto means admitting that you just have no clue whatsoever. 

I only came to terms with this myself around January. And let me tell you that it has been so liberating. The freedom I feel knowing that speculative posts on Reddit no longer have any effect on me is hard to describe. With this newfound freedom, my interest and focus on crypto and blockchain has only grown stronger. So newbs, and everyone, take a moment and reflect on what you want out of this. Focus on your own personal understanding of crypto and its benefits and downfalls. Learn, learn, and learn, but use valid sources of information, not speculation. In closing, I'll admit I'm a HODLer. But you do you and enjoy the fact that you get to be involved in the early stages of some incredible technology.

Any advice for my noob-criptocurrency-investment-strategy?!,"So I'm planning to invest some of my money in BTC periodically... I'm an absolute noob not only on criptocurrency but also on any type of investment. There's no much money I can invest per month, just 35-50 bucks max. Which believe me is a big amount on local money (I'm not based on the US).

I was thinking the best idea would be to start buying each month this amount and hold it until it became a bigger quantity (something like 0.0X) and then start trading small amounts to see profits. I don't think is a good idea to start trading right now 'cause the fees are going to kill my money.

Do you think this is a good idea? Any advice?",1520382186,07/03/2018 00:23:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82k1ey/any_advice_for_my/,1

Possible email scam; possible Black Mirror situation,"I received this strange email a few hours ago, and I am wondering what I should do about it, if anything.

The name of the sender pops up as Annabelle Robinson

From: ""cxrqcmo@castwin8.com""@e3.valueserver.jp

Subject: Extremely important data for u below

Hi [name redacted]. Have  several questions for you, won't take long, for you to go through and will surely take ur attention. Exactly how will you truly feel whenever all ur family members or friends will see you taking proper care of your own self? How would they truly feel is the suitable question here.

See where I am going with this one already? Ive poisoned certain porn sites with my malware that takes all information from your machine and obtains an easy access to it's web cams, and a lot more. So at this point i have a video clip of you mastrubating and a film you jerked to, additionally all your contacts.

This is your job email address, that I have seen on ur computer btw.

Ok last one, I have additionally edited the video to fit on a single screen, therefore it will be a lot more comfy to view for everyone. Anyways- if u want me to delete all ur contact information with the video clip, here is my Bitcoin wallet address - 

1HUXHsg3KAEZnrEHXjfELWDDxBnr6i5S87

just make sure that u won't copy no spaces or different symbols. You can easily find the details on the internet on how you can use this payment method if you have no idea how to. 560 is the sum in us dollars i need to leave you on your own forever.

This letter has hidden monitoring tool inside and i will know when you will check it, and from that minute on, you will be given Five days, to makeup ur mind.

I promise that each contact via ur list will see this movie, if for some reason i will not receive my funds.
U are welcome to make contact with ur local authorities or anyone, i doubt that it can help.

END EMAIL

So, this guy seems pretty uneducated judging by his syntax and spelling, but I'm not sure how much that says about his hacking skills. He also uses no technical jargon, but instead writes ""machine"" and even ""letter"" instead of the word email. The body of the email reads like it was personalized, but I could be mistaken. 


Has anyone else received an email of this sort? Does this seem legitimate in any way? Should I contact the authorities?

What wallet should I use for mining?,"Here is some background: I have been mining altcoins on NiceHash for about a year now. I was using Jaxx as a wallet to start, but now I have run into some problems.

I emailed Jaxx support for another reason and they told me to stop using Jaxx as my wallet for mining, because Jaxx is a ""lighweight wallet"" and will become unresponsive if I have too many transactions.

I would just send all of my funds to another wallet like Electrum or something, but because of the NiceHash hack, they are slowly repaying me to my Jaxx wallet. So, I have a few options:

1. I send all of my bitcoins to another wallet and just send my payments to that wallet as I get them.

2. I use another wallet and use the same public and private keys to keep my funds (maybe a paper wallet?).

I think that option 2 is the best one for me, but I don't really know how to do it. Are there any other options that I may have missed?

Fundamentals vs Speculation – which is matters more…,"… and which can cause a bear market?

It doesn’t always matter exactly that fundamentals are good.
If speculation on fundamentals drove up the price, then yes.
But if speculation on the price going up drove up the price, then not necessarily.
In other words, could there be a bear market of speculation without a bear market of fundamentals?

What are your thoughts?  I personally think btc and crypto have ever-strengthening fundamentals, but I’m not sure that reality is enough to overcome the FUD in speculation. Such as this, lol.",1520421009,07/03/2018 11:10:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82nihp/fundamentals_vs_speculation_which_is_matters_more/,1

It is known that later James was trying to find a disc thrown in the city dump, but apparently he never succeeded.

Bitcoin isn't the wild west. The world is.,"People who lost their BTC on MT GOX only get fiat back in their claims years later.  Yet, the guy who was responsible to safeguard their BTC gets his claim back in BTC after it's appreciated a million percent.

That's called corruption.  That's called the Wild West.  Bitcoin is not responsible for this.  It's letting people have control of your money.  Lesson learned.  Do not let ANYBODY control your money.  Not banks, the fed, bitcoin exchanges, etc.  NOBODY.

For all we know, the Japan govt may be using Mark Karpeles as a patsy and is selling the hundreds of thousands of bitcoins to THEMSELVES.  Gotta wonder why KOBE STEEL scandal came out recently amidst Trump tarriffs on steel which affect Japan YUGELY.  also japan is like the 2nd most indebted nation in the world behind the USA

Banks and Bitcoin are like caterpillars and butterflies.,"For those who like to believe Banks are on the way out with the come of crypto, think again...  Banks hate crypto....NNNotttt....!  Bank made crypto, in order to maintain control in the foreseen event of their own bankruptcy.  

USD, or USA, which ever you want to call it is 71Trilion $$$ into debt,  they have been passing on the debt from generation to generation.  The generations are just not coming out as fast as before, cause of the debt.  Thus foreclosure is imminent.  The current usury of money is destine to die sooner or later.  So what do we do?

We prepare, a currency, that is fee-able, however small the amount.  It has to be a one world currency unit because the USD is the current world reserve... remember when we go down, we are bringing the rest of you down with us.  We rid of world debt, foreclose our banks, and let the new system come into play, but at a global level.

Bitcoin prevails, we collect our fees and our banks have new names.  Coinbase, Mycelium, Breadwallet, etc.  We don't care what they're called, as long as we collect the fee...  We don't want crypto associated to any laws rules or regulations in fear that when we do pull the plug on the current economic system, bitcoin sinks with it!

This is a transition like caterpillar to butterfly.  The caterpillar must die so the butterfly may come to life and live on.

We will alleviate you of your mortgages, car loans and debts of all sorts, but we will also make money obsolete.  We are hoping crypto will take over smoothly to make this transition as smooth as possible.

Be safe, godspeed everyone!

Bitcoin Daily Confirmed Transactions at 2-Year Low,"The height of the cryptocurrency craze in December of last year saw prices soar, causing both aggressive and conservative investors alike to take note. During this rapid growth period, there were whispers of an eventual “crypto bubble” that grew louder as prices increased. While there has been no “burst”, cryptos certainly seem to have lost some of their luster. This came to a head in February and can be seen in the frontrunner of the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin. Not only has the price of Bitcoin dipped significantly, but so too has the number of daily transactions revolving around it. Average daily transaction figures are one of the key metrics for valuing cryptocurrencies, so large scale movements are worth monitoring.

At its peak, Bitcoin had a price of nearly $20,000 and reached an all-time high volume of 350,000 daily transactions on December 16th. Bitcoin’s performance since then has been less than optimal. Bitcoin’s price briefly slid below $6000 and although it has since recovered, the current price point of $11,526 (according to Coin Market Cap) is significantly off of the currency’s highs. What is also worth considering is the number of transactions conducted involving Bitcoin. In February, Bitcoin transaction volume averaged 150,000 transactions daily, less than half of what took place two months prior. In combination, these factors certainly seem concerning for Bitcoin’s prospects. The question now becomes whether this is truly a bubble, or simply a bear crypto market?

A qualitative analysis would point to the latter being the case. Prices during the end of last year seemed to be reaching unsustainable levels, causing the market to quickly overheat as Bitcoin prices escaped the reach of the average investor. A price correction, given how rapidly prices rose, was an outcome many elite investors foresaw. As prices fell, more capital poor investors were once again able to invest, creating a foundation of support for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s utility as a benchmark cryptocurrency as well as the blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin are also encouraging factors. Blockchain technology is still in its infancy and yet has been adopted by numerous sizable organizations. This bodes well for the long-term sustainability of many cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin.",1520442486,07/03/2018 17:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82pv0b/bitcoin_daily_confirmed_transactions_at_2year_low/,0

withdrawing to Fiat : Coinbase vs Bitstamp,"Hey guys. 
i live in the US and was wondering what is an easier option to cash out on my earnings. coinbase or bitstamp? 

i hear alot of horror stories on coinbase but never hear much about bitstamp. i know bitstamp is an EU exchange but i live in US. wondering if anyone had issues cashing out from bitstamp to US banks.

thanks",1520445715,07/03/2018 18:01:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82qand/withdrawing_to_fiat_coinbase_vs_bitstamp/,1

Lightning Network Fiat Settlement,"Dear LN experts,

Is it possible to directly cash out from say LN to USD instead of settling bitcoin transactions on-chain? I feel like this is important to have especially for merchants  who have to cash out to fiat right away in order to avoid volatility risk. 

If so, are there any projects or exchanges that are currently working on this implementation? Would love to learn more of how this would actually work in practice. 

Thanks, 
LN newbie",1520451011,07/03/2018 19:30:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82r13j/lightning_network_fiat_settlement/,2

Transferring from qt wallet to ledger,"Hi guys, 

Real dumb question, but I would rather be safe than very very sorry. I have held some bitcoin in a qt wallet for a couple of years but I am now moving it all to a nano ledger s. I am sending the bitcoin and I have used the 'Use available balance' button. What I want to clarify is: do I want to tick the 'subtract fee from amount' button? 

I know this seems really stupid, but I lost some Vertcoin a while back for an unknown reason so I'm being super cautious. I have already sent a really small amount to test. 

Thanks in advance. ",1520451270,07/03/2018 19:34:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82r2ee/transferring_from_qt_wallet_to_ledger/,2

From what I have been reading, the Trustee has sold somewhere around 18,000 BTC (out of 185,000 BTC?!?) causing the market to tank over the past three months.

My question is, since the creditors have be reimbursed... would it not be better if the remaining BTC to be removed from circulation? Would that restore the value of BTC that had been lost?

1. Each wallet has only one private key, can this private key be renamed (with the help of some sort of software?) and the former owner can NEVER get access to the wallet of a new owner?
2. if the coins is transferred from paper wallet (seller) to cold wallet (buyer), is this completely safe for seller and buyer to transact if seller finally agrees to sell wallet like this by transferring all coins into the buyer's wallet before payment?

You’re welcome,"I just bought a tiny amount of Bitcoin because it has been going down all day today, it seems like we reached a bottom, and I had some money to spare.  If what happened just after most of my Bitcoin purchases is any indication, Bitcoin’s price will go even lower just because I bought some.

Legality of Bitcoins in Albania,"Although crypto-currencies and ICOs still stay largely outside of Albanian legal framework local government's bureaucrats have generally negative views of digital money. This was re-established in July 2017, when The Central Bank of Albania (""Banka e Shqiperise"") issued DEKLARATE PER SHTYP: Mbi rreziqet ne lidhje me perdorimin e parase virtuale (translation: Press Release. Over risks related to the use of virtual money) where the list of ""important Bitcoin risks"" was disclosed.

For nobody's surprise it includes ""the usual suspects"", including, ""enabling illegal activities"", ""money laundering"", ""financing of terrorism"" and ""smuggling of illicit goods"". None of digital economy's obvious benefits, which already have helped millions of disenfranchised peoples across the world to receive access to the wide variety of financial and banking services were mentioned in this release. That may serve as a clear indication to what direction Albanian legislators will take in a future while trying to restrain the growing popularity of crypto-currencies in their country.

I say ""more evidence"" because of the evidence that already exists in the form of the timing of those first couple dips, the futures markets, and the Mt.

Beware of sophisticated scammers,"I got an enquiry from a Facebook group for a guy who wanted to buy BTC from me and was willing to pay with Western union since he lives in a different country. 

I wanted to use LocalBitcoin's escrow, he insists that we use another website called https://corebtctrade.com

Turns out this site is a scam, most probably owned by the guy who is trying to scam me out of my BTC. Upon close inspection, the site is poorly done, only has 3 live trades in total, has no social media presence and has zero pages indexed in Google.

Beware of using any unreputed escrow sites like these.

Here's a screenshot in case the scammer takes the site offline:

Is the MTGOX lawyer the dumbest person in crypto?,"One: dumps on the regular market and not OTC, which would have given him/his clients a much better price and leaving the remaining BTC that also don't belong to him at a higher valuation.

Two: if for whatever reason he absolutely must market order dump, why not Bcash and Bgold and maybe a few other fork-shitcoins before? Again, this would have left the BTC at a higher valuation, which as I understand the legal situation, is part of his job (i.e. getting the best deal for his client).

Can someone contact him and advise him   how to not be a complete whale-moron?",1520497558,08/03/2018 08:25:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82w00v/is_the_mtgox_lawyer_the_dumbest_person_in_crypto/,130

All4BTC/Bitsandcoins Consulting UG has become a Scam,"TL;DR; New owner of All4BTC is happy to take payments via BitPay and not deliver goods. The company has gone into complete radio silence since taking my order. BitPay has told me that they have received enough complaints that they stopped processing payments for them. Be warned of using this site and of having any dealings with Bitsandcoins Consulting UG and its new owner ""Martin Mischke"".

According to unternehmensregister.de this company changed owner from Dylan McFadyen to ""Martin Mischke"" on Oktober 4th 2017. 

In mid December I made a purchase on amazon.co.uk using All4BTC. Communication was sparse and after complaining on twitter @bitwala was kind enough to give me an email address of ""Nina Östling"" via @bitwala. She responded to me claiming that she had completed the order and I could expect delivery in the next weeks. To this day I have received nothing.

In January I tried to contact them about my order to no avail. After complaining on twitter again, I @bitwala gave me a phone number of Nina Östling, but she has never responded to me, despite being marked as Online on WhatsApp.

I have sent two formal notices, but without response. So it seems going to court is the only thing left for me. Since December 2017 I have not received a single response of any form from the company.

Another interesting thread in connection with this company is by a Co-founder: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2815136.0

All of the recent reviews on https://www.trustpilot.com/review/all4btc.com show that people are having similar problems. One even saying they have filed police reports.

I hope ""Martin Mischke"" will see the damage that his behavior is causing to his name, so that he will come to his senses. Fortunately I'm in Germany as is the company, so I think I have a better chance in the legal system than some others might.",1520498703,08/03/2018 08:45:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82w2yq/all4btcbitsandcoins_consulting_ug_has_become_a/,1

Newcomer perspective - why I am not worried,"I am a newcomer who went into Bitcoin at just over $8000 after the crash at 6th of February. Here are some reasons why I don't stress about the current situation.

1. There is typically a lot of negative talk regarding whales. Sure, I get the frustration and general annoyance. However, the fact that 'some' whales brought dips to the market also gave newcomers like myself incentive to join in at an affordable price. Bitcoin, and many altcoins, have become more accessible for a wider market as a result. Once the price of Bitcoin stabilize and continue its upward trend, we have gained a larger customer base. The ownership of Bitcoin has spread out more. There's no reason for me to complain about this.

2. There are limits to potential drops of Bitcoin. There are scores of whales that are heavily invested, with far more cash to spare. For them every dip is an opportunity and they will buy up any crash, regardless if it is caused by Mt Gox, bot trading, fears or any combination of factors. Lower price means a better deal for the whales and traders. If you consider most big whales to be greedy, then yes, they will buy the shit out of dips that they deem profitable and they will not be interested in seeing a complete crash to zero because it doesn't benefit them at all.

3. I am not applauding the behavior of certain whales, but let's be honest; most of them are motivated by rational self interest and what benefits them as a whole will more often than not also benefit the market in the long-term. Every sale is the result of a previous buy. Over time, the price will improve in spite of dips and crashes. Most buyers will not sell far below their level of investment. Exceptions exist but they are not defining the market.

4. I am happy to be alive and take part of this opportunity with the booming technology. While my decisions may be correct or incorrect, depending on the decisions and interests of the market, I enjoy being at full responsibility regarding my investments. If I fail, it is because I didn't read the market properly. It's all up to me and this, for me, is a great sense of freedom. Inflation however is not freedom. I'll choose freedom any day and take responsibility for my actions, for better and worse.",1520501871,08/03/2018 09:37:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82wb6x/newcomer_perspective_why_i_am_not_worried/,5

For how long can a steady 250K BTC sell pressure hold down the market?,"Bitcoin adoption can be manipulated down in the short run, if you have endless fiat or a whale load of BTC to sell. What happens once you're out of BTC and the current fiat hyperinflation really sets in? 

- We are in a historic inflated credit bubble, with the shadow banking system much worse than in 2008. Many of the biggest banks are de facto bankrupt only held up by government bail outs. 

The next waves of Bitcoin adotion is not retail investing, or idealistic ideas of a new credit- and fiat- void economic system. 

It will be hoards of panicking investors flocking on to the only life raft in the sea: Bitcoin.

Try go trade in your worthless paper gold or silver IOUs when the card houses comes tumbling down, and good luck with that.",1520503259,08/03/2018 10:00:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82went/for_how_long_can_a_steady_250k_btc_sell_pressure/,5

Tried my very first MultiSig transaction using Copay and custom miner fee.,"I created a 2-3 multisig wallet on Copay to use with my wife. I used a custom fee of 2sat/b (costing me 6p in UK). As soon as I sent the money, the other wallet magically popped an alert asking for approval. I approved. (I obviously mimicked my wife's role here).
I think this is the most elegant and secure Bitcoin transaction I ever encountered. Multisig is the way to go and Copay works like a dream. I've never used Electrum but the interface on Android looks dated.

[Bloomberg Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/bitcoin-s-tokyo-whale-sold-400-million-and-he-s-not-done-yet)
&gt;Kobayashi, who’s liquidating the tokens on behalf of Mt. Gox creditors, has another $1.9 billion to offload.



I see 2 things very critical:



1) Zerohedge inventing a timeline with 'offloading soon'



2) Bloomberg claims to know that Mr. Kobayashi plans to offload. Where is the proof? I want a fucking proof!

Objective View of Mt. Gox Trustee,"The first thing to note is that in market such as this, as in the stock market, people sell and buy to serve their own interests foremost.   The trustees interests are in reimbursing those who lost their money, not in serving random and unknown bitcoiners. So it makes no sense for people to get worked up over his actions or to suggest how he should proceed.    Always be aware that the actions of others, especially ""whales"", can affect the value of your stake.  Also, the trustee seems to be succeeding in his goal of getting enough money to pay those who are owed, so calling him a ""moron"" (or other names) or offering him unsolicited trading advice is entirely useless.


Second, some people are complaining that those who lost should be reimbursed according to the current value of BTC and not the value at the time of the loss.   That makes no sense.  To see why, just consider what the situation would be if the value of a BTC was now $1.   Would people be saying, ""give me the $1 it is worth today instead of the $400 it was worth then""? 


Third, some people seem upset that the ""leftovers"" will, by law, go to Kerples.    That reflects poor thinking.   After the creditors have been paid, who should the leftovers go to if not the shareholders?


Fourth, remember what we yell here everyday.   How bitcoin is about decentralization, people being their own banks and controlling their own money, power to the people, etc.   Well, act as if you believe it.   If you have just realized that you don't or can't control the value of your money, then simply get out.


Fifth, Mt Gox did not cause the 2018 crash.   What happened is that there was a drying up of the pool of suckers who rushed in at the end of 2017.   That is too bad for those who had planned to be millionaires by now, but there it is.   Better to accept it and live with it, instead of wildly lashing out.


I hope you find all that helpful in calming down.

How to avoid a 5th Mt.Gox Crash? Soft fork and blacklist the trustee address to freeze the funds?,"Knowing the impact of the sale of 18k btc had on the market, it’s painful to imagine the impact of a 150k sale. It could damage the ecosystem for a short term. And knowing how the trustee seems to handle things, I think we can be afraid of what he is gonna do if he has the green light from the court to liquidate all bitcoin. 

On the other hand, All the people from Mt.gox are gonna be refound the equivalent of Btc they lost at the value of 400-500$/btc after the 18k btc sale from January and February. It might not be fair because some of them would have prefer to keep their bitcoin, but it's better than nothing. And it seems that all the remaining BTC are not gonna be redistribute to the people who got hacked, so those BTC doesn't really belong to anybody. 

Shouldn't the Mining Pools and the community push for a soft fork and blacklist the address containing the remaining BTC. 
This would allow to freeze the funds before an alternative solution is found (alternative as a major sell off on the market).

States cannot own property,"Due to the way that States are created, obtain their funding, and obtain their land -- fundamentally, due to the nature of the State itself -- it is simply impossible for a State to have a property right in anything. There are several ways that States can come to positively control land, none of which gives them a normative private property right in that land:

1. By buying the land from previous owners. Since usually States must be financed by taxes (stolen money), any acquisitions made by States are illegitimate. Even in the States of old that did not tax, they were still coercive monopolies on protection (that is, they violently prevent anyone from competing with them in the rendering of protection). Thus, we cannot claim that the money they obtained was legitimate -- they wouldn't have obtained that much if not for violently preventing competitition.

2. By decree. Unoccupied land is ""declared"" to belong to the State. This is not a legitimate way to come into ownership of land. To obtain a property right over something, you must first homestead it. Simply pointing around yourself in a 360-degree circle and saying ""mine"" doesn't constitute homesteading. Actually working the land does.

3. By conquest. This is outright robbery.

4. By emminent domain. Again, outright robbery, except of the States' own citizens.

5. By actually ""working"" the land. Still, this does not give a property right. Working land is one requirement for coming into ownership of it. The other requirement is that the tools you use to work it were rightfully yours in the first place. If I steal your plow to work a plot of land, that plot of land isn't legitimately mine. If I enslave you to plow a plot of land, that land isn't legitimately mine. In short, it is impossible for States to homestead land.

Summarily, because no State can ever possibly be legitimate, no State can ever possibly rightfully own (have a property right) in anything. Of course, States positively control things. In the same way, if I hold you up at gunpoint, and steal your money, I positively control it. That doesn't mean I own it, or have a normative property right in it.",1520518957,08/03/2018 14:22:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82xtcm/states_cannot_own_property/,0

Did the Mt Gox Trustee really cause the Jan/Feb 2018 crash?,"I've seen the charts where each time he dumped his Bitcoin the price went significantly lower. I definitely can see how this is a highly bullish sign for Bitcoin if he really did cause the major price drops.

However, Bitcoin has been doing an average volume of $6 billion per day! $500 million over 2 months seems like a small drop in the bucket to me. How would this make that large of an impact on price? Any thoughts?

My ideas:

**1)** It don't have much effect on price and we're just making this up to explain why the price fell.

**2)** Majority of the daily volume is bots simply trading the same small amount of bitcoin repeatedly causing the volume to be unusually high, and therefore the $500 million actually was a large dump on the market.

**3)** Though it's a small amount relative to the overall volume, many additional new hodler's panic sold at 18k and 6k once they saw the price drop rapidly. And it led to scaring off new buyers as well.

*Note: Regardless, I'm long term bullish on Bitcoin. I'm just skeptical that this was a major catalyst for the recent correction.",1520519732,08/03/2018 14:35:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/82xwoc/did_the_mt_gox_trustee_really_cause_the_janfeb/,2

Maybe I'm slow - but isn't the fact that this dip is only caused by dumping and a bit of panic selling a good thing in the end?,"I mean, all it means at the root is that some whale has lots of coins to sell, so naturally price will reflect that but theres;

-No bad news about the tech (there never is)
-No hacks
-No bans or FUD from any government

Legit questions about Bitcoin's DISTANT future issues...,"So I am curious if anyone has crunched the numbers on the viability of the following threats that could maybe occur in around 10-40 years:

&amp;nbsp;

1) Doomsday-motivated address burning.  

&amp;nbsp;

So I am unaware if it is realistically viable to imagine that eventually either Quantum computers or even just future server farms with &lt;1nm Graphene tech could successfully aim to hash out all of the possible Bitcoin Private Addresses.

&amp;nbsp;

I am unsure of the current total computing power on Earth at the moment, but I think its somewhere around 1000 PetaFLOPS.  So then it is conceivable that in 20 years there will be super computers with 1000 PF on its own, and if so - Would that be enough to hash Bitcoin's addresses to death over the course of 10 years?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

2) Not enough Decimal Places!!!

&amp;nbsp;

Now I know some will call me crazy, but I don't think many people realize how possible IT IS for Bitcoin to become worth $10,000,000 per coin in 20 years.  I am aware inflation makes this conversation hard, and so let's pretend inflation didn't make this a non-issue by then.  I am NOT saying Bitcoin will reach these price levels, but what if it did?

&amp;nbsp;

The smallest TX fee theoretically possible is 1 Satoshi (unless I am mistaken), and that would be a 10 cent fee for the THEORETICAL minimum.   The current minimum realistic TX fee (0.00000224 BTC) with a $10m BTC would be $22.40!  Is it complicated for an upgrade to add another few decimal places?   Would this be a simple hardfork, or could it be a softfork?    I know lightning aims to help with this, but it would never be enough imo.  People will always want the option to viably send some money on-chain.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, would anyone see it as desirable to eventually change the halving so there is a permanent 0.1 new BTC mined per block?  That way we could at least replace the bitcoins being lost by people, and it would only be a 0.53% inflation rate...

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

3) Doomsday 51% network hackers/BTC destroyers.  

&amp;nbsp;

How much money in mining hardware is currently used to secure the network?   What percentage of the Bitcoin Marketcap is this?  I am concerned that even if Bitcoin hit $100,000 per coin this year, some government or Total-Anarchist group could buy a sufficient amount of hardware to simply 51% the Bitcoin network and burn coins.  At what point will it be too expensive for even Jeff Bezos to get enough mining hardware to kill the network?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Really curious to have some focused discussions on each of these points...

Are these MT Gox's liquidation deposit addresses?,"Back in 2014 /u/quantabytes posted analysis [that showed they had identified the wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29gojr/an_update_on_the_202000_mt_gox_bitcoins_using_our/) holding Mt. Gox's ~202,000 BTC. 

They posted txids for the transactions but the paste is down. Here's an [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20150726155800/http://pastie.org/9340417#). 

I looked at the addresses associated with those transactions and none of those BTC moved until December 2017. Then fairly large amounts of BTC started moving into what looks like two exchange deposit addresses: 
First, https://blockchain.info/address/1MLGpEQfzd44vPuiihuazPL9tW7qzew1J5 then https://blockchain.info/address/14LuAvrRzAmeikgaafs7H5695xs5dVXqA5

The total deposited into these addresses is a little more than the ~36,000 BTC that Mt. Gox said they sold but considering the previous analysis on these BTC as well as the timing, it seems likely that these are Mt. Gox BTC being sold at an exchange. 

Thoughts?

What happens when the last block is mined.,"I'm fairly certain I know the answer to this question, and forgive me if it is somewhere buried in this sub. But when we reach the last block that has a reward, the only source of income that miners will have  would be that of the actual transaction cost. So it's safe to assume that the majority of the total hashrate will drop when all the blocks are mined, because there's no money in it. So what I'm asking is, and I know when I say this that this is many years away, but what are we going to do, when our transactions start taking days to process because the only one mining is some wierd guy named Greg in his mother's basement with an 4th gen i5 and has a total hash rate of 50h/s.

Bitcoins current biggest problems and solutions,"Number 1: The mad FOMO rush that in late 2017 sent in hordes of lemmings with open wallets will not be repeated.   That is terrible for those who  have since been going to bed with dreams of mansions, lambos, and millions (of real money) in the bank.    The solution to this is to accept reality and settle for making small profits on a daily or even weekly basis.


Number 2: Governments were willing to overlook all this as long as it was just a little, harmless joke.   Now that serious money is involved, and with scams and criminality involved, a hands-off attitude is no longer acceptable.  The solution is to give up foolish dreams about bitcoin becoming the world currency, doing away with governments and banks, etc. and instead work with government regulators and proper banks to bring bitcoin into the mainstream.


If  people pay attention to all of the above, then there might still be a happy ending ... or at least one that is not total disaster.",1520542037,08/03/2018 20:47:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/830ul7/bitcoins_current_biggest_problems_and_solutions/,0

Price is *limited* by hashpower,"I love being bullish just like the rest of you, but what nobody here ever seems to talk about is the effect of the opportunity cost of mining.

If the price all of a sudden soared to $1,000,000 next week, investment would flow into mining where the difficulty is low and bitcoin is far easier to obtain (cost of mining &lt;&lt; cost of buying).

As the price outpaces difficulty there is a point where new and existing miners (arguably the largest market using bitcoin) sell their coin to buy ASICs, because they can get *more bitcoin* that way.

Please keep this in mind. The idea that MtGox sell off is the only reason the price has been down is ridiculous, people need to take profits and miners are selling for more ASICs.

Why Not Have The Market Regulated By Technology Itself?,"We want all the benefits of a decentralized currency but also want ONLY the benefits and safety that comes from centralization (like preventing what the Mt.Gox Trustee did these past 6 months).

What if there was some sort of algorithm created within a decentralized exchange that once the amount of coins you own can disrupt the market, would prevent any one body from selling ""too much"" **within a short period of time** and also sell the coins for them in a safe manner.

We obviously know that if a whale was to come around a literally dump 50,000 coins at once, this would cause massive issues. Well why not have an automated system in place that would prevent them from selling 10,000 or even 5000 coins at once?  If they want to sell that amount, they would need to simply place the amount they want to sell, say, 10,000 into the system and it would automatically sell them over a period of time in a very safe way (could take months or every years depending on how much they have). 

I understand that this would mean you probably won't get to sell at the price you want or even receive it in a timely fashion, but we also can't possibly expect to have a decentralized market with no minor downsides.

**I apologize if this seems like an absolutely foolish idea and I would appreciate anyone to educate me on this.**",1520545290,08/03/2018 21:41:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8319ow/why_not_have_the_market_regulated_by_technology/,0

"I officially sold 100% of my bitcoin holdings today. I'm off the ride, and I'm kindof sad about it. Just wanted to tell somebody.","(This is not a story of me losing faith in bitcoin.  The opposite.)

I first got involved in bitcoin in around 2013.  I bought my first bitcoin for about $120.

From 2014-2017, I did one of the smartest things I've ever done, and set up an automatic weekly buy of $50, telling myself that this was money I wasn't going to touch EVER.  Bitcoin morpheus and all that.

Early last year things started getting...nervous for me.  The few thousand dollars became &gt;$10,000, and I started thinking ""holy shit, I have more than $10,000 of magic internet money.  I am an idiot not to sell this!?"", but I just held strong, reminding myself that I was a hodler.  I was in this for the long haul, and I wasn't fucking selling.

In November/December things started getting *really* nuts, as my holdings ballooned (I also had a non-insignificant amount of ethereum), to around $200,000.  My wife, who is extremely supporting of me, was completely supportive of me hodling through EVERYTHING.

I started looking at yachts.  At this point, buying a $120,000 yacht (a 40 foot sail cruiser, which would fulfill one of my life goals of sailing around the world) was possible.  I wasn't going to sell, but it was completely nuts to look in my account and see an amount in there that could legitimately make this dream come true *today*.

But still, I told myself: either this is going to be a global currency, or it's going to be worth nothing.  HODL strong.

At this point, I moved all of my funds to cold storage (hodl storage!) in the form of multiple cryptosteels distributed across multiple safety deposit boxes (with redundancy).

I'm a holder.

In January, I set up one of the first lightning nodes in the world on mainnet, and used some of the dust I still had sitting in coinbase to buy myself an (expensive, haha) t-shirt from blockstream.  ""Don't trust Ver~~ify~~"".  I love that shirt.

Well here's what happened in the meantime: my house went up for sale (I'm a renter)...and the amount of money I had in bitcoin meant that I could just buy it.  Actually even better: the house I'm buying has a small guest house/casita in the back, so my bitcoin isn't actually buying the house, it's making a large enough downpayment on the house that the rental income from the casita pays ALL of the mortgage on a half a million dollar house.

So this is where my story ends (for now).  This is my moon.  I'm cashing out, and because of my cashing out, I feel like I'm exiting the system to some degree.  I can live for free forever, and when I feel like it, I have a half a million dollars in land.

The first thing I'm doing is buying back in (aggressively), but it's going to take YEARS to get back to where I started.

This stuff is the future.  There is no doubt in my mind about that, but at the same time: I still have to live in the world.

To all the people who believe in this technology with me, the ones who are willing to buy my coins because you, like me, believe that they're worth $11k (no, $10.5, no $10.7, no $11.7k, no $9k, no $10.5k, no $50k): thank you.  

I'll be back soon to buy yours.

What would be an unimaginable use case for Bitcoin/blockchain tech that will be common in 10 years?,"If we valued the internet back then based on its first use case (sending messages i.e. email and chat) and not on previously unimaginable applications (social media, uber, airbnb, etc), we would have severely undervalued it.

Bitcoin today is, in my opinion, severly undervalued. What are your ideas for use cases that we would think is crazy today but will possible be commonplace in 2028?

One of mine is ""Streaming money"": people (or machines) paying or getting paid for work or services per minute of per second in real time. 

Another is people no longer owning cars but using tokens to take any car and use it for a amount of time and pay exactly for this amount of time seamlessly and automatically (no qr codes, no buttons, no POS).

Localbitcoins still alive? It consistently fails for local trades and support doesn't even answer anymore,"On **Jan. 17th**, I met with a guy who bought 0.0065BTC. Releasing the coins triggered some server error. After refreshing the page, my side looked normal. Funds released. Release code visible. On his side not so much. The trade also looked finished but his balance was zero.

Being a first timer he was very nervous about the whole thing, I saw he felt like I might be scamming him and it was only 6 mBTC, so I returned half his cash in good trust we will meet again and settle it.

I reported this to LB immediately. 

7 days later I finally got a reply to my actual case:

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I see you have released bitcoin, but it stuck under escrow wallet. I have notified our technical person to check and manually release bitcoin for you. It may take 7 days. If problem still not solved after 7 days, please contact us for update. 

7 days later I asked about the case.

It took them another 7 days (**Feb. 7**) to come up with this gem of a helpful support message:

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; We are sorry for the delay. The issue will be solved by the end of this week. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for understanding!

Of course my ""next week"" reminder was left unanswered until finally (**Feb. 21**) somebody competent ... nah, just kidding ... :)

&gt; Hi Leo,
&gt; 
&gt; our sincere apologies for the delay!
&gt; 
&gt; This request will be processed beginning of next week.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your patience!

After this there was silence. No more answers from support. Now if it was only 6.5mBTC, I could maybe just forget about it but today on my next local trade (the other, online trades work fine) I now had to explain my buyer thanks for the fiat, here is your release code, sorry for your loss of 0.04BTC this time. This is not funny. I took my cash trades down for now and recommend all others to do the same until LB takes action.",1520559225,09/03/2018 01:33:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/832ydr/localbitcoins_still_alive_it_consistently_fails/,15

Short selling on cryptocurrencies should be prohibited for now,"Why? Because it gives hackers an incentive to attack exchanges and profit from short selling. They can't manipulate traditional markets so easily, but to cryptocurrencies they can (based on recent incidents). If they can profit from such attacks, they will do it again and again.

So I think it's a good idea to prohibit or at least limit short selling until the major exchanges make their system bullet-proof.

How I store my seed words in the cloud. Please review.,"I'm a programmer but not an expert on cryptography. 

So the community consensus is to write down the seed words and keep it like cash or your important documents.

But I believe otherwise, the seed words should be encrypted and kept on the clouds , multiple places. This way it's easier to restore when needed and it's harder to loose your seed words than write it down.

 I believe with strong encryption this method is as secure as other methods yet provide more benefits.


I wrote the code myself and run it offline.
So here is my methods. : 

*  I have arbitrary length pass phrase called PASS

*  Generate a random 256 bits cryptographic salt called SALT.

* Use PBKDF2 to hash PASS using SALT ,1 million iterations.Choose result size to 256 bits. Store it to AES_KEY

* Encrypt PASS with AES_KEY using AES algorithm .

* Result is converted to base64 string.

* Store the SALT together with Encrypted string on clouds, mail it to yourself.


This is a bit technical , but what do you guys think?

Got scammed out of 70K... is there anything I can do?,"First off, Yes - I feel sheepish, yes had I spent more time researching it wouldnt of happened, Yes I realize that I am a moron for letting **$70K USD** slip out of my hands, so please dont remind me of that, I learned that lesson.  The website was legit looking, I trusted it wouldnt come from googles top searches pointing to Reddit which then pointed to a scam from this user &gt; https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1

Secondly, I lost my BTC after importing a private key (after I had sent my funds to a new wallet) into a wallet downloaded from electrumbtcp,com (DO NOT GO HERE.) I then transferred my funds BACK into Exodus but mistakenly didn't create a NEW address by clicking the ARROW on the right.  This mistake cost me $70K USD.

I got into cryptocurrency a few years ago, but not in a heavy sense, just as a merchant accepting BTC. I ran a large minecraft server and a small portion of our user base shopped in BTC back when it was $200-300.  While this didn't give me anywhere near the $70K that I lost, it got me started.  I then invested what I could into ETH early on and hodl'd it as long as possible.  I wouldn't consider myself a ""newbie"" at trading, investing or mining for awhile.  I've done several forked coins and I didn't, in my wildest dreams, think that it'd be a malicious wallet.  I've been trained to ""Send coins, get the private key - send funds back to newly created address"" - I thought thats what I was doing.  

I know my funds are probably gone forever, I want to know how I can warn others, how I can report this to (whatever? country authorities) as a malicious website.  I'm not looking for attention as much as I'm looking for possible help with bringing down this website.

For ref heres the wallet that stole my funds:

**Can I get a upvote for awareness?**


* Edit 1: I have reported this to the French authorities (Though I am a USA resident I dont think anything will happen with it).  I appreciate the kind words. 

* Edit 2: Any french law enforcement or lawyers that want to help?

* Edit 3: After searching ""BTCP Wallet"" the reddit post came up &gt; https://i.imgur.com/7hT0nCL.png The user  https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1 posted about it that it ""was already available"", I realize this was my fault for not fact checking this.

* Edit 4: User is spending the BTC now &gt; https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/1EgaeuKXBs1kJGx68JtqhxeDGLsAxkDfbx/ 5.0 sent to address https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/17PJew5bTxscbFGpL6MFTmZMM95mvjNFJL/

* Edit 5: should I even bother reporting this to the FBI / police? Will they try to pin me for fraud or something for not reporting buying BTC? (crazy I know but I dont want a double hit here...)

* Edit 6: It looks like user (jhkansen1) here on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1) is alerting everyone to navigate to the scam website.  **Can I get in contact to find his IP / authorities?** https://i.imgur.com/pk0Tw7r.png - it looks like its the same user that scammed people out of BCH and BTG - the same websites that are using the ""electrum X . org/com"" variables.  These scammers seem to be pretty big and unconfronted, which doesnt make me feel good about where things are in the crypto realm.

* Edit 7: Friendly and nice advice from an investing group on how to track / what to do:
&gt;@Kainzo sorry to hear this. I’m sure you know this information already but watch these wallets carefully (below). They contain all your BTC. Try to see if you can set reminders or notifications on them to monitor activity. These wallets contain all your BTC (they won’t add up to the same amount due to transaction fees). The pattern of the transfers definitely seem programmatic so I doubt you are the only victim. That being said, the scammers are human, too. Not sure if they’ll HODL or want to liquidate in this dip. If they liquidate, then they will either 1) send to an exchange (you’ll be able to identify wallet addresses that are linked to an exchange so keep an eye out for activity) in which case once you notice the activity you should alert the exchange immediately, or 2) they will sell it off locally with a platform like local bitcoins, in which case it will be highly improbable to trace. If it is option 1, if the exchange cooperated with you, then you may be able to retrieve your lost funds. Fiat-to-coin exchanges like Coinbase should be on your side as they are under strict regulation to avoid processing dirty money, and they are well aware of this. I doubt, though, that the scammers will go the online dump route, due to the transparency and risk I just mentioned, but at this point it’s still worth the watch. Even if they go on some other exchange, still contact the exchange immediately. Because in that case they may be trying to transfer out in something like Ethereum, and you will have no way of tracking it once it leaves the exchange.

* Edit 8: Another mod from Cosmic Trading on Discord
&gt;@Kainzo wallet addresses associated with exchanges will usually be dumped into a central wallet owned by the exchange or some subwallet that is also owned by the exchange, which contains other people’s bitcoin too. If blockchain.info recognizes the address it will display which exchanges wallet it is. If not you can try to google the wallet address you suspect to be and exchange and it should provide some transparency.
You can try to alert authorities to identify the user who stole from you but it is unlikely they will be able to do anything about it since the scammer probably resides outside your country and law enforcement only has jurisdiction within, unless your case is escalated to some FBI equivalent in France
Even so, it is unlikely they will escalate or prosecute for a financial crime this size. Not saying $70k is small by any means, but the type of cases they deal with are more money laundering to the extent of millions

* Edit 9: Someone asked me to post my LTC address (LXzurqezb6PZsnJvoyiYfD5HnzLhFf6nPh)
* Edit 10: Going to bed feeling very defeated.  Unsure how to push forward in this scene and feeling wholesomely stuck.

* Edit 12: Trying to get a list of Crypto Exchange support emails to alert them of the fraud BTC that could be coming into the exchange.
* Edit 13: Someone compiled a list of all the accounts used by the scammer - these should be hunted down by Reddit and others to be removed so others dont fall prey to this scheme.
&gt; The following accounts are all used by the scammer.

Bitcoin Mining Questions,"Hi all, 

I'm planning on building a mining rig (mainly for educational purposes) and I had some questions before I got to work. 

1) Am I correct in stating that the costs associated with mining include A) the upfront cost of the hardware you need to purchase and B) the monthly electricity bill? 

2) What part of running the mining operation plays the biggest role in consuming electricity? Cooling the hardware or running the mining software 24/7?

3) Let's say I wanted to automate decreasing the energy consumption of my bitcoin mining rig at night (so that it didn't make as much noise). How could I edit my mining software to do that? I assume the easiest way would be to decrease the number of active ""threads"" running at certain hours. Would this play a significant role in decreasing energy consumption?

Found an old (2013) blockchain wallet &amp; backup file .json. Need a little help recovering it - no passphrase and password for blockchain doesn't work,"So I finally found my old old wallet. My info on the blockchain website works, except my 2FA doesn't because I no longer have that phone number, I sent support a message but who knows how long that will take!.

I have a couple old backup files that I tried recovering from using their website but it says there is an error, recheck password. I tried it via brute force but nothing seems to work... I would have made it the same as my blockchain password. 

So I'm wondering if there are any other ways to recover this or is my only option to wait on support..

So are there likely to be more Mt Gox trustee deposits?,"There's 160,000 Bitcoins sitting in a trustees account somewhere.

Like many others, I would just like to get on with things and get some market stability which I was hoping for bar Coinbase insider trading, Binance attempted hack and so forth ... 

Although the crypto market has always been volatile this type of thing is at least somewhat predictable.  

There are rightfully a lot of angry people out there who lost in Mtgox. Likewise they are raging over this. Meanwhile there are people saying dump it all and get this over with - something nobody can control because crypto is not regulated. Then there's the FUD folk who keep stirring the pot. 

Realistically, what are we looking at here? Another dump in a year just as this ""dip"" recovers? The coin will never hit the market?

I'd love to get some concrete proof of what exactly is happening with MTgox now. When or will everyone be paid back? What happens to the rest of the coin etc? 

There seems to be surprisingly little fact out there...

A quick word about bulk cross trades (and about the Mtgox trustee crashing the market),"Some of you already know me from my previous [reddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lu6ze/an_extensive_guide_for_cashing_out_bitcoin_and/). 
Today I am going to talk to you about an aspect of the crypto market that I discovered a few months ago and which continues to blow my mind on a daily basis. A market that only a few people really are familiar with, because it simply did not exist 6 months ago: Cross trades for amounts over 10k BTC (&gt;$100m).
I will explain how a buyer and a seller try to exchange OTC large quantities of crypto aginst fiat, or crypto vs crypto (e,g BTC/ETH) for large amount, in a single transaction.  I thought no single individual except Satoshi possibly had more than 100k btc until I saw it with my eyes. It took me time to realize it was true.  
It's ironical I drafted this post way before the Mtgox Trustee decided to screw us up by unleashing its stack on the  market in the most unappropriate way. As I highlighted in my previous post, bitcoin is still a very thin market and trading on exchange and not OTC is a sure way to crash the market. If you are an early bitcoin adopter and held all these years, you certainly care about the price. If you want to let the market unaffected by your exit, cross trades are the way to operate. This post might be boring to some of you, it does not intend to be funny, but to clarify how this market is operated right now, and how it should be organized.

**How I got involved.**  

Following my reddit post, I was contacted on telegram at year end. Private chat with 2mn self distruct. A simple message: ""I have a seller for 40k BTC willing to sell at 5% discount""
My philosophy in life is always to give a chance to people. Even though I thought this was 99% likely to be a scam, that I had not sleept for 2 days following the inflow of messages that had buried my reddit inbox, I gave a chance to this guy; and the nightmare begun.

**The problem with cross trades today.**

You must be familiar with the concept of [""Six degrees of separation""]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation)
Anyone in the word is 6 phone calls away from any other guy. Might be Donald Trump. But it might also be Satoshi after all. Anyone knows someone who knows a bitcoin whale.
In this context, if someone tells you he knows a seller, and you naïvely start looking for a buyer, what will inevitably happen is the following:
You will be right in the middle of a chain of 7 introducing agents that connects a distruful seller to a distrustful buyer. 7 people who think they are entitled to a cut on the trade just for the privilege of providing the name and phone number of the next guys in the chain. All of them will picture themselves as the new Jordan Belfort, and explain to you rationaly why he diserves a bigger cut than you. Meanwhile, the deal does not progress, negociations between introducing agents go on and on endlessly, the 5% discount is completely eaten up by their greed and when eventually an informal agreement is found with everyone, the fluctuations of bitcoin has gotten either the seller or the buyer dead cold. And that's when an end party does not turn up to be ghost bid or offer in the first place, potentially wasting the time of everone involved in the transaction.  
Some people in the chain would also patronize you. They would claim they have settled such deals in the past and know better than you. They would even try to intimidate you to squeeze you or get you out of the chain. 
One guy threatened to report my company to the FINMA for alledgedly misrepresenting a trade. I have spent over a year setting up my business in the most professional way, hiring full time crypto trader, in-house lawyer, compliance officer, analyst, relationship managers. Paid hundred thousands of Swiss Francs &amp; BTC  in salaries, expenses and legal opinions to be able to legally and transparently operate according to the regulations in Switzerland, and just like this, one guy thinks he can shut me down to increase his cut ? come on.  
That's what a cross trade generally looks like today. The wild wild west. An emerging market full of non-professional introducing agents eager for a get-rich-quick 1% introducing fee on a crypto wealth that was created out of a long and painful hodling by the seller.

**Distrustful Buyer and Distrustful Seller**.  
One big issue with cross trades is who should show his cards first.
Typically the buyer would not want to disclose his identity before the seller shows a proof of life of his wallet. I will spare you the kind of scams whereby a would-be seller replies to the request with a virus-infected video of his wallet.  
Similarly, legit sellers would not want to disclose their id easily before seeing a proof of funds.
This problem quickly becomes a dead end when communication is not direct and information gets lost in translation within the chain of introducing agents.  
To solve this issue we have elaborated a neutral procedure for both parties, but I have to say I am generally on the side of the seller here. First, it is common for sellers to spread their crypto wealth behind several address for security or confidentiality reason, so showing a proof of BTC ownership for 50k BTC at once is not easy. No seller would consolidate their assets in bulk before negociations have moved to an advanced stage just to please a potential buyer they are not even sure is legit. Message signature to show proof of bitcoin wealth, as well as micro transaction from several addresses become quickly a cumbersome process. Besides, many sellers who are historic holders sometimes went in BTC early on a ideology basis, for the sake of privacy and anonymity. They have a hard time easily compromising the confidentiality they have clung to for years. This is a cutural issue that buyers fail to understand, especially so as buyers for this size generally are financial institutions, late to the game, coming from a world where confidentiality towards governement was given up centuries ago.  

Buyers are impatient, they are used to quick deals on financial markets, settled bank to bank. Sometimes I can feel they have a old generation mindset. A legit buyer came to me looking to buy 40k BTC, just because his (well known) company, which is involved in commodity trading, could afford to pay for it. He was talking to me in CAPS LOCK on SMS, quickly started to insult everyone in the chain, asking to talk in direct to the seller, bargaining my fee despite me showing a full 5% discount. When you do not know a market and its specificities, you don't see the opportunities. After weeks of work on that trade, being treated of miserable broker by this guy who was so full of himself was hard to swallow on my end. I am active in the finance industry at an institutional level for more than 15years, just because on that trade I offer liquidity in bitcoin does not make me less legit than if I was brokering on other another market.   

**5% discount really ?**  
Most of the deals I have seen over the last 3 months involved the seller showing a discount from 5% to  8%. It does make sense when you think about it. Liquidity in fiat is scarce for such amount. Cashing out could take weeks. Even through OTC desks like cumberlandmining, selling btc for tranches over $1m widens the spread as you wipe out their order book.
The privilege of selling so many bitcoins in just a single transaction, makes it worth it to accept getting rid of them at a 5% discount.

Another reason why a discount is a common thing is because of the amazing BTC price increase over the last years. What is 5% when you have increased your asset by 20000% in 5 Years in $ terms. Still 5% discount is an effort from the seller and at least should pay for the privilege to show your cards in second not first.

Traditionally the discount comes from the seller, however beginning of February this year, when Bitcoin crashed from its top of $20k a piece to $6-8k an interesting dynamic happened. A buyer came to me and he was fine paying a premium on the price since he was in a rush to close the deal at this attractive price. This is a real market. Premium/discount should vary dynamically depending not only on market prices but also on the eagerness of either party to close the transaction. I might be hated within the industry for saying this but if you are a seller, do not get intimidated. Do not get talked into showing a discount as if it were natural. Anything above 5% discount is abusive to me. 

Similarly, a buyer bargaining endlessly to trade at a 2% discount is a joke. Volatitlity is the very nature of crypto. Arguably, saving 2% on a $400m trades saves some decent money. But if you fix the price at 4pm, bitcoin can trade 2% away at 4.01 pm anyway. If you are really willing to buy such a large amount of crypto, at least try to understand the market. Also, be commited. If during the negociations, the typical price movements get you cold I might blacklist you as a time waster. Remember that your counterparty, the seller, has probably been holding for years, and during this time he had the market moved against him by more than 80% from the top. In this context, the seller will disregard your bid and won't take you seriously if you start bargaining for 2% discount.

**The economic rational of cross-trades and the philosophical issue**  
My personal opinion is that direct cross trades should be settled at market  though a predetermined fixing date &amp; time agreed contractually, based on a reference website price like blockchain.info or coinmarketcap for greater transparency. The escrow or financial intermediary in between should not take more than 1% flat of the trade to be split 50-50 by both parties. Then it becomes rational to trade in block for everyone, as it is actually cheaper and quicker than trading in tranches of $1m btc equivalent on Genesis. 0.5% for each leg on trades of 50k btc, that's what my company does when I have selling and buying interest I can match. It is a price no one can compete with. Now, because it is a young market and so many introducing agents are typically involved in connecting buyers and sellers, the anarchy prevails. But I can tell you already from experience what will happen soon:  
Goldman will enter the market, they will open their crypto desk and they will try to crush everyone. Buyers will rush to trade there because hey, it's Goldman Sachs, and sellers who actually hate the banking industry will have no choice but to hand over their BTC to an investment bank if they want to sell in bulk. Sad, but true. 

Cross trades would make Satoshi cry out from his grave in its current form: Crypto was created to exchange peer to peer, without midlemen of financial intermediation. Bulk cross trades right now involve several layers of intermediraies. Besides, it is currently a mecanisme that transfers the wealth from miners and early adopters to the hands of financial institutions. Most of the buyers I have seen in all these trades were financial institutions or banks. It's not a surprise for this amount. There were some individuals amoung the buyers: late comers rich sheiks or rich families from Emerging Markets. But generally speaking it was the financial world buying bitcoin. Shockingly, I can even reveal a central bank was involved in a very large block trade. When all the banks will have acquired bitcoin, the same thing will happen to this market as what happened to gold. The price will be manipulated. Having gold in collateral, banks like JP Morgan were able to neutralize the price by shorting the futures safely. For each ounce of physical gold now, you have 400 ounces of paper gold in existence. Physical gold is only $8 trillion market cap, so it can be manipulated easily. Unfortunnately, the same might happen to bitcoin when the transfer from individuals to financial institutions is complete. I do not judge what's happening right now, I just feel a little sad about it. I have banks willing to buy in my book. I have hedge funds. I try to execute in the most professional way. And if I close a trade after working so hard, I am happy. The buyer and seller are happy because the trade was cheap and fast, and somehow I have modestly contributed a little more, at my level, to global adoption. I know you guys do not like this theme but some banks entering the crypto scene is  a way for us to introduce our trojan horse: Adoption is closer than it ever was before.    
At the end of the day, Goldman might open a crypto desk, they will certainly get the buyers, but I doubt they will get the sellers so easily. A lot of sellers are still ideologically oriented and biased negatively towards banks, and fortunately they still prefer to deal with crypto intermediaries like my company than with a bank.

**KYC...KYC is mandatory.**  
So let me get this straight: If you intend to make a 40k BTC deal (&gt;$400m) without showing a passport, think again. It won't work. If you are not willing to show it to a Swiss regulated entity, bound by banking secrecy laws, then you will never show it to anyone, and you will never do the trade.
Besides, if you are not ready to give me information about you, and I can't draft your kyc for my records, I cannot include you in my book and show your interest to other counterparties. It means that even if you are legit and can proof ownership over 40k BTC, I will not show your offer to a potential buyer because I cannot certify you are AML compliant. Same thing for buyers: You are an asset manager and you claim you have a buyer for $400m, but you have no power of attorney nor are  willing to disclose the kyc and Id of your buyer, then I am not interested. I only deal in direct. I would share revenue with you and would consider you as an introducing agent obviously, but I want to deal in direct with the end party. If I don't know the end client, how will I be able to show any legitimacy to a potential seller ?  
In any case, kyc is the first mandatory step for a X-trade. I would keep the info confidential, but I badly need it. I am audited, and anyway nowadays it has become impossible to transit fiat in the banking system without  establishing and documenting an extensive profile and full paper trail for any client. As a financial intermediary subject to Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act, we shall be provided with extensive KYC information relating to the buyer and the seller. It protects everyone in the trade, not just us.  

*kyc for seller.  

The kyc for the seller is the most difficult to write. I will refer you to my reddit post where I explain in detail what's needed. If we meet physically, and you collaborate on every aspect of your story, the documentation for your kyc can be done in half a day and the drafting would  take another couple of days.
What takes longer is the account opening. If you sell 40k BTC, you do need an account that will not freeze the money after execution. This is something I can provide, but account opening can take up to 4 weeks in Switzerland, even with a crypto friendly bank like the ones I work with. You have to start the account opening  process early before we start negociations with prospective buyers.
Besides we will need an extract from your wallet to run services like elliptic.co, chainanalysis.com or scorechain.com

*kyc for buyer  

As I said, buyers for this kind of amounts are generally financial institutions.  
*If you are a bank or a hedge fund I need:*  
Shareholding structure  
Regulatory status from your financial supervision authority  
Trade registry extract with authorized signatories list  
Bylaws  
Board resolution to show the intention to buy X btc, and formally authorizing the signatories of the contract to represent the bank in this context  
ID, CV,and proof of Address of the representative appointed by the board resolution.  
Proof of funds.  

*If you are an individual:*      
Copy of the passport  CV, name, surname, date of birth, address, country of residence, professional activity proof of residence, and explain to me how in the world you are able to buy half a billion USD of bitcoin in one shot. If you want to buy for $10m ""only"" ;) it is the same, I need to understand your background and source of wealth.
Also tell me where the funds will be wired from (Bank, country, city of provenance) ., so I can liaise with your bank officer.

*kyc for the introducing agent.  
just because you introduce me to a bitcoin whale or to a large buyer won't save you from a kyc sorry guys. pm me to see what's needed.


**the procedure and the solution**
After failing consistently to close block trades for over a month, I realized something was wrong- Buyers and sellers of bulk trades all have their own procedure, which has been generally drafted to their advantage, in detriment to the other party. One seller would insist for instance to install bitcoin core on the buyer's computer; the buyer couldn't care less.

There are two ways to solve the problem:  
**1.the first solution** is what actors like Jonathan De Rin and his group, Nordic partner/Satoshi trading have adopted. They would force their way up the chain of intermediaries to try to take control over all introducing agents, connect the buyer and seller in direct, and re-structure the deal holistically rather being confined in the russian doll problematics of layers of introducers.  
It is agressive, requires a lot of nogociation and bargaining, but could work.
The problem with this approach is that it only solves part of the solution:  
when buyer and sellers are eventually connected they can decide to squeeze everyone in the chain.  
you generally need an escrow account to settle the transaction. setting up an escrow for a crypto transaction is not so easy and takes time. Unlike the buyer, the seller often has no connection to the finance industry so he would have to rely on the buyer for the escrow set up: At that point the seller would be giving his counterparty more power, or he would need to involve a lawer who would take an additional cut.  
Besides, an escrow account belongs to both the buyer and the seller. Both of them are the beneficial owners. Let's be honnest, because of price fluctuations, the deal can fail at any time before execution. So once you have set up two escrows for nothing the bank will be nervous and will never want to do business with you again. Setting up a escrow costs about 0,25% of the amount of the trade. But as usual some banks and lawyers will try to benefit from the situation and try to ask for way above than 1% for the set up ( Abusive, once again)  

**2.our solution is different.** We do not act as traditional intermediary. We are the direct counterparty to the buyer and the seller. It changes everything:
We build a book of interests so we are ready to pull the trigger when another leg arrives to the party. Buyers and sellers don't need to be connected directly. A seller could be selling against 3 different buyers in a real OTC way. When the funds arrive on our corporate account/wallet we become the beneficial owner of the funds. This model is backed by strong legal opinion drafted by Pr. Bahar from [Bär karrer](https://www.baerkarrer.ch/), an expert in Switzerland, it was validated by VQF our SRO, and approved by the Finma.   
Sellers and buyers get comfort from the fact we are regulated. If the deal fails we return the fiat. similarly if a buyers vanishes, we return the crypto to the seller. Funds transit and clear properly through a Swiss Private Bank. We give a dedicated IBAN for each buyer, even though all your funds are belong to us, during the deal. it's all agreed by contract.  
From a contractual viewpoint, we would simultaneously sign a purchase agreement with the seller and a sale agreement with the buyer, both contracts being subject to the delivery of the cryptocurrencies, respectively the official currencies (ie. If one party fails to deliver in the predetermined deadline, the deal would fail and any paid amount reimbursed)  
It's a mystery to me why Genesis or other OTC desks focus only on tranches between 50 and 100btc and do not facilitate large trades. My fee is the same, whether you trade 100btc through my company or 10k btc, I do not increase the spread. 1% for each block trade, 0.5% for each party. Quite cheap.  
Dealing as a direct counterparty to the seller and buyer gives us the power to close the trade swiftly, because when the end party asks ""show me your funds, if you want me to believe you"", we can go ahead and show proof of life of wallet or proof of funds. our limitation is we cannot park cash for more than 60 days because of Swiss laws on public deposit for non-bank.  
Fortunately such trade settle in less than 60days. If you fly to Geneva to do your kyc, chances are the other  party will be in the next desk, doing the same. And we might probably be able to settle the next day.

here is our procedure:  

1. KYC checks and NDA signed with business introducers;
2. Business introducers disclose the identities of the buyer and the seller;
3. We perform a full KYC check on both buyer and seller, including a physical meeting with both parties preferably at our office in Geneva (or travel expenses at the charge of the party to be met);
4. The seller provides us with (i) a wallet extract so the balance in BTC can be checked and address can be scanned through dedicated forensics services, (ii) a proof of ownership of the wallet (message signature or micro transaction), and (iii) any KYC/AML information required in relation to the origin of the BTC;
5. The buyer provides us with a proof of funds and any KYC/AML information required in relation to the origin of the funds;
6. Once the buyer and the seller are cleared, we discuss with both side to fix the price for the BTC and any other specific conditions;
7. Simultaneously, we makes sure that (i) the seller has a bank account where the proceeds of the transaction can be transferred and (ii) the buyer has a wallet where the purchased BTC can be transferred;
8. Purchase and sale agreement stating the number of BTC and the applicable price as well as  fees are entered into between our company and the buyer, respectively the seller;
9. Business Introducer Agreements are entered into between our company and the parties introducing the buyer and the seller;
10. Transfer of the BTC to our company's wallet;
11. Once the BTC are received, transfer of the payment to our companie’s bank account;
12. Once the payment is received, transfer of the BTC to the buyer and the payment to the seller, less 1% of each leg if the deal involves business introducers, 0.5% if the deal is in direct.

Regarding the involvement of business introducers, we suggest them to sign a “Business Introducer Agreement” in relation to the leg of the deal they introduce to us. 
Specific conditions such as a premium or a discount negotiated by the business introducer will be reflected in the Purchase and/or the Sale Agreement between our company and the buyer respectively the seller so all the parties have a clear and transparent view of the deal. In this context, the business introducers’ cut will be adapted accordingly, our company will not claim any of the special discount/premium negotiated. we do not want to be greedy. We just want to make some trades and as said earlier, we prefer to deal in direct with end buyer/seller.

**Bulk trade of Altcoins.**  
At the moment BTC/Fiat is the main market for block trades. However, I had a specific request for BTC/ETH for a very large amount and also IOTA/BTC. If you are looking to buy IOTA in bulk, please contact me on pm.
As long as atomic swaps have  not avanced to the next level, cross trades of Altcoins might be needed, and they should be operated through transit wallets, in a similar way as what I described above.  


**bottom line**  
Again, it's  a crazy long post. Sorry if I sounded doctrinal. I have spent countless hours on deals  that went nowhere, and had a lot on my chest. Bitcoin is a fascinating market. Now that some deals are closing, and central banks are getting involved in crypto very discretly, I thought a clarification post was needed. If you are a large crypto holder, interested in such transactions, then please contact me on telegram or signal @swisspb. I will try to make it work for you. If you are Mtgox trustee, I know you dont care about where bitcoin is headed. you just want to get rid of it asap. Please consider cross trades, for the sake of all the people you are representing in this trade. They have suffered goxing 1.0 and don't want to be involved in goxing 2.0 just because you do not know how to execute!  

Cheers,
Olivier

A possible answer to the question what drives the Bitcoin price and a thought about a marketing team,"I was curious what drives the Bitcoin price so I made an analysis and the main outcome is that the Bitcoin price is related to news occurrences. I also looked into Google search terms and how search is related.

Here are the main outcomes and thoughts:

* Bitcoin in the news drives Bitcoin price
* Google search for ""Bitcoin"" is a result of Bitcoin being in the news
* Maybe Bitcoin should get a marketing team as news is an important driver for Bitcoin


The whole analysis with lots of graphs, the code and more is on GitHub:

A decentralized exchange,"Technology blockchain is rapidly developing around the world. Its appearance had a significant impact on the development of various industries, and, first of all, the financial sector. The possibility of decentralized data storage and the creation of services on the principles of smart contracts are those engines that contributed to a massive influx of users into the cryptocurrency market and the growth of the industry as a whole.
Today, the bulk of transactions for trading cryptocurrencies are carried out on exchanges with centralized management. However, the time, the development of technologies and the closure of a number of centralized exchanges vividly demonstrate their imperfection: there is no transparency in the execution of processes on such exchanges, which excludes the possibility of objectively assessing the risks of the Exchange failing to fulfill its obligations. This situation, of course, looks unattractive for traders.
The EVEN DEX cryptocurrency exchange is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, the main principles of which are security and transparency. This is facilitated by the work of the exchange on the principles of blockchain technology, the work of the master node in an untrusted environment and a decentralized depository protected from third-party interference.

How to make easy money with bitcoin,"Hallo friends,

Today I'm gonna tell you the ways of making easy money in life using Bitcoin.
Let's say you came in a little late and you started your crypto journey somewere in January... You probably had some nightmares by now, but those days will be over in a second. Let's say you bought 1 Bitcoin for $18,000 and today you can buy the same Bitcoin for only $9,000. At this moment you have a 50% loss, but what if I told you that it doesn't have to be that way? If you would spend another $18,000 today your loss would be reduced to a 25% loss. Afraid of the price even going lower? Don't worry you will just have to do the same trick when the bitcoin price will be $6,000. That way you can always reduce your loss and you will only need a small gain to get break-even.

Calculations:
- You bought 1 Bitcoin for $18,000. Bitcoinprice is $9,000. You will have a 50% loss and your break-even-point will be at $18,000/BTC.
- You bought 3 Bitcoins for $36,000. Bitcoinprice is $9,000. You will have a 25% loss and your break-even-point will be at $12,000/BTC.
- You bought 9 Bitcoins for $72,000. Bitcoinprice is $6,000. You will have a 25% loss and your break-even-point will be at $8,000/BTC.

We can lose a fight, but we can't lose the war!

Much love,

Nafasion",1520594571,09/03/2018 11:22:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/835zok/how_to_make_easy_money_with_bitcoin/,0
Will EU law (GDPR) cause conflicts with Bitcoin's nature of being open?,"In a few months the GDPR laws go into effect. In a nutshell this means companies have to measures in 

*  storing/processing privacy related information like names/transactions/etc 
* provide insight and a way to delete information to consumers
* give the EU power to fine companies that don't

but what about Bitcoin and GDPR? transactions are public information but will mining/processing transactions be subjected to GDPR? I think this could be a possible attack vector - It is impossble to apply GDPR laws to Bitcoin. You can't delete or hide anything.

Trusted Third Party Escrow Service,"Any help would be appreciated!

I'm trying to sell about 750k worth of BTC to a person that I was connected to in an OTC trading chat that I'm a part of. Basically he's going to send me a bank wire in USD for the BTC.

they sent back the original amount of bitcoin I sent.. im out of the item and down 30%? surely this is not right? I can't see them refunding me the same amount if it was the other way round?

Lost 4.0 BTC with an old wallet,"So sometime during 2014-2015 I lost 4 BTC by using ""Pheeva"" wallet if anybody remembers that mobile wallet from Lamar Wilson's Love Will company. I emailed him about this situation when I could no longer log into the Pheeva wallet and he simply told me I had the wrong PW. ( I saved this PW easily 10 safe places so that I would NEVER lose it, but yeah I had the wrong PW he claimed &gt;&lt; ) 


Long story short after countless attempts to reclaim access to this wallet I emailed the CEO of this company and he did respond. After a LOONG back and forth via e-mail he finally helped me a little bit and gave me the encrypted string to this wallet which he claimed that I had forgot the PW to. I am wondering since this wallet and company is dead as hell now is there any hope in recovering these 4 BTC? 


I would share these coins with anybody willing to help bruteforce this corrupted wallet , and if I got screwed and Pheeva got those coins from me and I shall never see them again I'd rather have that peace of mind over wondering if I can retrieve them and not only help me and my wife and 2 children through tough times but hopefully give a huge tip to anybody who could help us out..

Thanks in advance , I really just want to know if its possible and if it is I would be willing to split the wallet contents with anybody who can help retrieve the coins. ",1520597550,09/03/2018 12:12:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8368gv/lost_40_btc_with_an_old_wallet/,64
bitcoin more valuable when regulated,"heres an interview with some finance professor arguing that bitcoin will get more valuable when regulated. thought id share this since ""omg regulation incoming"" is a fud narrative so often here. opinions?

---&gt;
The prices of crypto currencies such as the Bitcoin have been fluctuating extremely for months, and investors are floundering on largely unregulated platforms. Should politics now step in and regulate crypto currencies like Bitcoin more?

Krahnen: No way. That would be the biggest mistake that the state can make. Crypto currencies only become dangerous to the financial system when they are regulated.

Why?

Krahnen: Take Bitcoin as an example. If the state wants to regulate him, he would first and foremost accept the countless trading platforms. There would be admission criteria, who may move there at all. Certain rules will follow, specifying what the amount of bitcoin that is traded there should be. This means that the state would interfere with the control process of Bitcoin.

Yes and?

Krahnen: And then there will be no stopping. The wave of regulation will then go so far that the Bitcoin is at some point just as regulated as normal money. And then we have the problem that private actors who invented Bitcoin are at their destination: they have managed to anchor Bitcoin as a legal tender and have in effect created a money printing machine. This has unforeseeable consequences for the economy and society.

The state would make the Bitcoin by regulation so really valuable?

Krahnen: Exactly. The Bitcoin becomes precious only when it is transferred from the current diffuse gambling world into the recognized, supervised world. When the state encircles Bitcoin through action, it becomes scarce and valuable.

But Bitcoin was intended by its founders as an alternative to the state financial system. There is nothing that Bitcoin fans fear as much as harsher regulation?

Krahnen: Right now Bitcoin has no fundamental value. There is only the expectation of the participants that he can someday be used for exchange purposes. But this only works as long as others believe in it. The value of a bitcoin thus results only from the expectation that the state will eventually be able to intervene regulatively, because so many people use it. When the state does that, it suddenly makes the Bitcoin pioneers bet: that bitcoin will eventually become an accepted means of payment.

What is bitcoin?,"Supposedly the eternal question with no great answer but I think I know what it is for me so I figured I would explain.  In the simplest way I can think of bitcoin and all crypto currency, it is a video game.  It was and still maybe is the best video game I have ever played.  I’ve been playing video games since the colecovision and NES all the way up to the switch now.  So I have a lot of experience playing video games for sure.  When I look back on the 6 months I have played crypto it was like a massive video game.  First I heard about it from my brother who bought a bitcoin at 2k.  Then I started my research.  I read Digital Gold which I kind of consider the instruction manual for the video game.  I started reading opinion on reddit and reading tons of articles and kept getting deeper into the game.  Eventually I looked at my options and decided to take a pretty large bet on bitcoin and keep learning.  Bitcoin and coinmarketcap get you looking at all the other coins and I’m assuming most others are like me and start speculating down that list.  When I really started I kind of believed in all of this.  The instruction manual and stuff I read seemed to point out that this is a real new trend and will be a huge deal in the future.  Maybe that is right but who knows how it works out.  So I got into this game and at first I didn’t trade much.  I just would put money into different things and see how it worked out.  Luckily I made a lot of small bets and some paid off stupid.  At one point I had 20 different coins and I was up on all of them.  I should have realized then that the game is ridiculous and I should probably take money out.  Eventually I did start taking money out because I learned this greatly improved my cost basis.  Eventually things blew up so much i could easily bring back way more than I put in and still retain a decent free stake and I sat there and thought about it for a while and eventually hit the buttons.  That was before the ridiculous run we had to start 2018.  So I then watched what I had left blow up again and took some profits.  Ever since I’ve mostly been holding and when things bounced a good amount I took profits.  This has happened again, and again, and again since we are in a bear market now.  My stake has been reduced to something fairly negligible to what it was.  I’m happy with the result and I consider all the stress and amazing times over the past half a year and I think I beat the game.  I beat it because now I’m not worrying about it.  That is the game to me.  It was a video game I lost sleep over and it messed with my mind and eventually I told it to fuck itself and brought home a bunch of cash.  Others won’t be so lucky.  They will watch fortune come and fade or they will watch an investment dwindle away.   

So bitcoin is pretty much the best video game on the planet.  It feels cool moving around assets to different exchanges and holding them on a trezor.  It’s fun exploring new coins and their ecosystems.  It’s fun going on different reddit subs to get community sentiment.  The game has so many awesome things I think it is here to stay but it will be harder and harder to profit from because the market cap of the game can’t keep growing the way it was.   I guess another way to think about it is like the best mobile game ever.  Or a new way to gamble.  It’s a bit of everything.  So play safe.  Try to make the game fun instead of stressful.  If it’s stressful you have too much money in it.  I did for damn sure.  Also if your coins blow up to something you want to bring home, do it.  This market does not care about you.  Take profits, reduce risk.  ",1520609976,09/03/2018 15:39:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/837k1y/what_is_bitcoin/,0

Star Trek meets Crypto! Make it so.,"A mate of mine in England is crowdfunding for his second Star Trek (The Next Generation) film. Don't roll your eyes though, the first one was actually pretty good and this new one apparently will be even better. He's only looking for about 9K GBP and considering how good the first one was with a budget of about 2K I thought I'd post this here and see if anyone wanted to help him out as it looks pretty cool.

Kind of a fun looking project anyway, and it could be a good way of getting a shout-out for Bitcoin with an on-screen credit to this community, which he'd be happy to do if he gets enough to fund the project.

A lot of us probably grew up with some form of Star Trek - mine was TNG and so I've chucked a bit his way. Kickstarter doesn't yet accept crypto unfortunately, however I've setup a BTC wallet if anyone is feeling generous

Is OTC shorting occurring in bitcoin?,"Watching the past month or three of crypto, there doesn't seem to be a way that Novogratz and co and every other crypto-hedge fund aren't getting totally massacred, and as such it would be in the news as they tend to be the CNBC-faces of the markets. 

By extension, if they're still up and running, the only explanation I can think of is they have figured out a way to short via ""the honor system"" for lack of a better word, because I don't think they got in early enough to still be firmly black.

Mt Gox Bankruptcy document,"$BTC Interesting document I found re. the bankruptcy of MtGox. According to the document, the creditor damages amount to something like $25,013,556,521 (25 Billion USD). The number of Bitcoins held was 202,163. And presumably they also then held 202,163 BCH. Minus the 30,000 of each already sold (400 million) That makes 24,600,000,000 USD needed from the sale of 172,000BTC and 172,000BCH. A tall order at around $129,000 per coin!

This is what we did with bitcoin.,"First, I want to say sorry about mistakes in my English, because maybe I want to sounds exotic or any not important reason.

One year ago and more in past it was vision; digital money of freedom with no government overwatch, with no bank connections, money that people really own, money for whole world doesn't connected to any country.


This is what we did...

Most of a news about cryptocurrencies now in general are FULL of government standpoint, regulations, bank relations, China here, USA there. Wow! This is what we wanted? Cryptocurrencies should be an anarchy, but they are on the hightway to slavery, don't you see it? 

Six months ago many of us meet people with zero technical knowledge asking about bitcoin and we were able to spend hours, whole evenings about talking how awesome bitcoin and cryptos are. Those people just unfortunately have in their brain just and only one thing; profit. So our new friends bought their portion of BTC for first 100 dollars in hope, there will be 1000x more best in few days.


This is what we did...

Most of those newcomers, are the first who left and sold, doesn't understand power of HODL. Society of ordinary people which doesn't want digital money, those people was profit seekers and during small storms in panic left the boat &amp; many of them don't want to hear about crypto anymore. 


Do not look at the nowadays blood storm like on something terribly bad, look at it like it's a cleaning rain. 

Cryptocurrencies are smart money and should be for smart people (next generation will be hopefully more smarter then current) again. Let's fall even more down, let's start all over...

Reminder of what Bitcoin is to me,"I feel like the constant drama in this space had distracted me as to why I'm in Bitcoin in the first place. I'm typing this out as a reminder to myself, and maybe others about why Bitcoin is here to stay.

Take a look at what's been happening in the past half-century. China became a police-state dystopia, the Middle East brought down by constant warfare, Russia is an authoritarian regime, the USA has lost control of its government. I dislike governments, because any centralised form of governance is easily corruptible. Rulers do not serve the best interests of its constituents. The constituents also allowed their human rights to erode slowly. We see that is TRUE for every form of centralised governance.

Privacy is the key to preserving our human rights. They have unleashed a censorship-resistant, immutable, open-sourced, borderless, neutral protocol that uses the infrastructure of the internet. When we come to master the technology, the people will take governance to the pace of the 21st century. Rules without rulers. Let a free market uncover truths, and the people make decisions.

Bitcoin will succeed if its community is behind its core ideology. I'm not attracted to altcoins because I'd prioritise decentralisation and network/social scaling over computational scaling. I'd be attracted to something that's more decentralised, private, and neutral, but so far, it doesn't exist.

"I thought god was directing me to sell, it was TA all along","I started seriously observing bitcoin Jan 18.  I soon found cryptowat.ch one night while really buzzed,  thought it was the coolest thing ever.  I left the window up ever since,  it updates my browser tab label.  Occasionally I'll open and watch if I read something on reddit about a big move.

Early this week,  when I looked at the full chart,  there was this white line, at an angle across the chart.  I thought it was a glitch,  and I ignored it.  I looked again later,  and the white line was still there,  but it had changed????  It wasn't a glitch,  it was ALIVE!

I went and did something,  then bitcoin begun a serious plunge,  next time I looked,  that damn white line was still there!  But now it was obvious that line knew something,  when the price touched that line on the chart,  the plunge began!!!!

Turns out that first night I really played with cryptowat.ch,  I stumbled upon the fibonacci tool,  I clicked on the ATH,  the 6000 low,  and it drew these lines.  I must of soon passed out, or changed back to a 1M view, or ???,  somehow I had forgotten about the lines I put there!

Fun fact: 20% of the world's population is younger than Bitcoin,"In their eyes, Bitcoin will have as much credibility as the Internet or electricity: a tech so trusted that it's simply a part of the everyday life. 

&gt; ""...- Dude, of course money should be digital and decentralized. It's self-evident. I mean, how else could you buy things? With a stamped piece of paper?…""

One can already see it in the results of national polls: the younger are the respondents, the more Bitcoin users are among them, and the less trust they have in central banks. It’s a massive societal change in the making. 

And in a few years those Bitcoin kids will enter the voting age.

Looking for Selling Advice,"I need to sell some bitcoin to help pay for the medical expenses of an injured friend, but I'm running into problems with the two leading exchanges. Gemini refuses to finish verifying my account after more than a month. Coinbase can't keep their two-factor login verification with Authy functioning. Last year I had this same problem with them and it took them 6 months to fix it --one of many reasons I turned to Gemini. These people's pointless delays have already cost me in market value and I'm running out of time to meet these bills. 

Can anyone offer advice as to where I can sign-up quickly for a safe sale? I thought Localbitcoins might be an option, but I need a bank deposit to pay these medical bills promptly. Thanks in advance for any guidance. 

And to the people at Coinbase and Gemini who may be monitoring this channel, this is on you. There's no excuse for such hassle and if my friend's healthcare suffers because of your incompetent management, to hell with both of you.

Mt. Gox is WHY I like BTC over alt-coins,"Mt Gox dumped btc price from 20k to 6k by selling just 40k coins.  That is massive drop no way around it.  

The problem is centralization of btc.  And what happens when the big holders dump their coins.  There are still a few huge holders out there who could unilaterally, temporarily, destroy btc price.

Okay... so the reason why I like btc is because compared to the alt-coins, coin ownership is decentralized.  Almost every single alt coins could be destroyed by coin dumping by their huge owners, at any time, far far worse than what just happened to bitcoin.

Why all this Mt Gox Funds thing is FUD,"As a Spanish lawyer, most of the situations some people are describing are not going to happen. I don't really know about Japanese law but have enough common sense. 

The most probable outcome of this situation is the bankruptcy judge ordering a public auction of the 170.000BTC left after covering refunds at the price settled, 400$/BTC. Then, divide the sum obtained between the creditors.  
  
Why? If this doesn't happen like that, creditors would be facing a lose/lose situation, where they will only be fine if BTC stays at 400$. It would make no legal sense. If bitcoin goes down, they are gonna lose because there won't be enough BTC to cover their 400$BTC and If bitcoin goes up, they will just receive 400$BTC.  
  
Another fact that supports this theory is that if Mark Karpless gets the BTC left after paying creditors at 400$ per coin, MK would be profiting while creditors are harmed after him being a total negligent person, committing then *""illicit enrichment""*.  
  
So probably most of the 170.000BTC left would go to some big buyers through a public auction, not creating the selling pressure that some people is talking about. Again, FUD and misinformation to manipulate the market.    
 Edit: Also, the one in charge of managing Mt Gox bankruptcy it's obliged by law to manage the assets in the best way possible and making the price crash causing a sell-off by dumping his coins would be negative for them.",1520631165,09/03/2018 21:32:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83ac4h/why_all_this_mt_gox_funds_thing_is_fud/,6

Pool miners would make small amounts over time, but in either case it is a financial incentive to run a full node and increase the security of the network...

This is Heather Lee who is going to California College of the Arts in San Francisco. My major is Interaction Design and one of my classes requires an interview to know about people in this field.

The purpose of the interview is to know what is interviewee's value of money. The interview will be an hour long and I know it's quite long. I'll offer the interviewee something like coffee, food or $40 cash to appreciate your time spent. 

I live in SF Bay area, so it would be perfect if I can do an interview in SF.

Feel free to contact me!
Hope I can hear your opinions.

Thanks!

"A third of my wallet balance is ""dust""?","I'm moving my bitcoin wallet to a new phone, using Airbitz on both.  I'm a small-time miner, just using my GPU with NiceHash while idle, so I've only got ~0.035 or so.

I've connected the wallet on my new phone and it only shows a balance of ~0.025.  I assumed this was some sort of error so I tried to send my whole ~0.035 to a new wallet, and it says it can only send ~0.025 because all the rest is ""dust"", which apparently means tiny balances spread across tons of wallet addresses, all too small to be used.

I haven't used Bitcoin a lot (I've done maybe 5 transactions total) so I don't understand how fully 1/3 of my balance could be non-spendable like this.  Anyone know what I should do next?  Is this 0.01 BTC just gone or can I recover it somehow?

We are working on a bitcoin application. We wanted the community to come up with some catchy and witty names for it. What have you in mind? We select one with the most upvotes.,"The basic idea of the application is that many people raise very small amount of BTC's which are aggregated into a huge pooled amount and given to one person randomly selected. It's a bitcoin lotto. Every user is anonymous and the process IS extremely simple - i mean we got it down to a degree where even toddler can use it.

Our idea can be summarised as ""a contest for which the prize consists of the amounts contributed by the various competitors."" Each user raises 0.0002 BTC (1.88 USD); 0.0001 goes toward the total bitcoin amount pooled and the other 0.0001 BTC is the service fee.

**The recent comments have made us realise the trust issues we have to face.

Maybe there's a way to make major banks and Bitcoin work together,"Just a random thought; instead of having large banks decide to either rip off blockchain technology or outlaw BTC purchases on their credit cards, maybe there's a different way.

How do we move BTC from wallet to wallet or wallet to fiat? We use exchanges, right? Enter the banks. They surely have the capital and multinational banks would easily have multiple forms of currency available for use depending on location. I think a smart move by banks would be to just embrace BTC as a semi-legal tender and handle conversion from fiat to BTC and vice versa...more or less have a division that runs simply as a cryptocurrency exchange. They still profit, we get a chance to profit...everybody wins.

Is there any reason to not buy bitcoin using coinbase as a wallet till my hardware wallet comes?,"Just curious if there are an conceivable down sides to using coin base till my hardware wallet comes? Security reasons? Privacy reasons? I cannot for the life of me get a straight answer on what exchanges to use other than coin base for buying bitcoin. There seem to be so many websites people mention, but nothing really concise on websites other than coinbase people really trust. Is there anything that has a reputation that is equivalent or at least a few runners up to coin base? I'd reaaally not like to get scammed, ( I don't consider high prices from coin base being scammed) Id pay a lot for security.",1520674458,10/03/2018 09:34:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83e8cs/is_there_any_reason_to_not_buy_bitcoin_using/,2

"4 BTC stolen, trezor sucks, booking scam and how I feel","Yesterday night I was about to check my balance on my trezor, as I do from time to time with no particular reason. As soon as I log into my account, lights out: ~3.78 BTC - aka 35k USD, aka please kill me - sent the morning before, March the 8th, 11am. Got scammed, hacked, fucked, dunno.

This is the transaction:
https://blockchain.info/tx/f40ffb71d7da61b5bc3f4eaf2f2bf66ed6c887bd0dce964660855d6f3b2198ea


All I could think was: how's this possible? I'm very careful with my cryptos, I use anonymous navigation for almost anything, my computer is well protected, trezor never left home and its seed, on paper only, never left the lockbox in my room. I'm not paranoid. I should have been. But I'm pretty darn careful with these things.


Then it came to my mind: March the 7th, I receive an email from ""Hotel SB Icarxx Barcelona via Booking"". They say that the credit card I provided could not be processed and that I needed to start a live chat to solve the issue within 24 hours. It looks strange, I don't trust it too much but it is indeed the name of the hotel I reserved, the email address looks kiiind of legit (something-numbers@property .booking.com), I just woke up and, most of all, I had legit issues lately with the very same credit card I used to book my reservation. This is what convinces me, *""this stupid card again?""*.

I start the chat, it all looks legit at first but it goes downhill when I'm asked to pay a new invoice they would send me by email. I close the chat, call the booking support and tell them what happened; scam confirmed, I was somewhat stupid but luckily non all the way stupid, end of the story. Or so I thought.
You know what happened one day later.


I blame me, obviously and most of all, for not being careful enough; I blame booking because some asshole of a scammer knew about my reservation (cookies and whatnot I guess); I blame Trezor, because what happened should **NOT** be enough to steal my BTC safely and VERY carefully stored with an hardware wallet.

I still don't know what to think, I'm not sure how I feel, I didn't speep much. I was a BTC and crypto enthusiast until yesterday, now it feels like this beautiful house of cards is falling apart in my mind. I never thought something like that could ever happen to me, it happens to others and one thinks ""I empathize *but* it's their foault for not being smart enough about it"".
I feel like if something like that can indeed happen to me, it can happen to most people I know. Smart and above average careful, normal people.

And if that's the case, I'm not all that enthusiast anymore.

Which to be honest is what hurts the most.



UPDATE: I didn't have the lucidity to think about it until now, I was too shocked... my ETH, all gone. From 4 different addresses protected by the same Trezor, 35ETH are gone. It makes a grandtotal of ~55k USD: All sent to this address: 0x293Bf98a946073f308C40137Ee2c6555bAdadB80

By following where the money goes, this is the last wallet i get into: https://www.etherchain.org/account/2b5634c42055806a59e9107ed44d43c426e58258

Why aren't more people use Bitquick rather than local bitcoins?,"I know when it comes to p2p LocalBitcoins seems to be the most attractive, but why? Most of the sellers charge AT LEAST $1:$.95 (5%) when purchasing BTC (Ex. BTC price is 10k but people sell for 10.6k).  Where as BitQuick takes a 2% fee, but the rate is usually spot on to the actual price. 


Sellers don't have to be established, because everything is automatic...Send your coins to an escrow account, when funds clear your money is released to your buyer and the seller receives funds in their account. **You don't have to deal with the actual seller**


Buyers require minimum verification ($400 purchase limit). All they require is a phone number and a name, you don't even have to sign up. Just deposit and wait for for funds to be sent directly to any valid wallet address.


Yes I know BitQuick was hacked in mid 2017 (down for a month, with apparently everyone paid back), but currently under new management with no problems since then...

**Anyway, I wanted to use BitQuick, but wanted to hear what the community thought before I used them.**",1520695582,10/03/2018 15:26:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83frsy/why_arent_more_people_use_bitquick_rather_than/,4

ecommerce solutions,"Hey coiners,

I am looking to create an online store over the next month and am wondering about ways to accept payments in bitcoin. 

It seems that there are a few different solutions, however I don't like the idea of not holding my own private keys. Coinbase launched their new platform, but they hold all of your coins. And I would much rather be in control of my own currency. 

That is kind of the point of bitcoin in the first place. 

Does anyone else have any experience with this? Some way to accept payments painlessly and have everything directed to a wallet that I control?

One of the biggest IT companies in the world (Mail.Ru Group) is accepting Bitcoin,"Mail.Ru Group is largely unknown in the West, but it plays a major role in Russia: it owns two largest social networks in Russia (VK, OK) messenger ICQ, and a games division (Warface, Armored Warfare, Skyforge, Allods Online, Perfect World), among other things. 

Google translate of their announcement (a bit edited):  

&gt; **Cryptocurrency is now accepted for advertising in the projects of Mail.Ru Group**

&gt; From today on, myTarget advertising platform for advertising on all Mail.Ru Group projects and in the partner network can be paid in Bitcoin (BTC), and the owners of sites and applications participating in the network will be able to receive income in the cryptocurrency in the near future.

&gt; Mail.Ru Group expands the use of the popular currency Bitcoin. The company presents a convenient method of payment for those who already conducts business in the cryptocurrency: for advertising on the projects Mail.Ru Group, including VKontakte, OK and Mail.Ru, now you can pay in bitcoins.

&gt; ""We strive to give our clients maximum opportunities for business development. The myTarget platform will become a launching pad for the ecosystem, which we will further develop, including other Mail.Ru Group products and gaming projects, ""says Dmitry Sergeev, First Deputy General Manager of Mail.Ru Group.

&gt; For settlements in the cryptocurrency Mail.Ru Group uses BitPay, a payment processing system in bitcoins, with more than 50,000 customers including Microsoft, Virgin Galactic, PayPal, Zynga.

"Blockchain isn't revolutionary, but rather decentralized blockchain is the revolution.","I often hear main stream media and even some crypto advocates say Bitcoin isn't the future but blockchain will be. Blockchain has been around for a long time, all blockchain is is a ledger keeping accounts of everyone's balances. This tech has been used by banks and other financial businesses for years, and this tech isn't really revolutionary but rather a more efficient way of accounting balances for bushiness.  

The reason why Bitcoin is so revolutionary and is the future of money is because its decentralized. I don't mean to take any shots at other crypto currencies but if they aren't prioritizing decentralization are they truly a crypto currency? I just wanted to make this post to stress the idea that we shouldn't be excited when we hear people say blockchain is the future, we should only get behind and promote decentralized blockchains that are censorship resistant.

I called to inquire about it and the associate told me BMO has blocked all crypto purchases because of “fraudulent activity”. Needless to say this bank is losing a customer immediately.

"Bitcoin whales, you are at danger","Hello guys,
Bitcoin is and always was the greatest solution to fight the corrupted bankers and their wicked ways of ruining our economy over and over. They have been the cause of every recession. Bankers saw the dangers of it and tried to fight it, they failed cause the community grew larger and larger.  But the big bankers are really smart, and feed on idiotic plebs. They drove the prices up really high and simulated a crash to plant the fear in you big holders and force you to take profits.
However, by doing so, you let them have a large portion of BTC, and that's what's happening right now, you're losing your BTC, and they're taking it.

If this continues, they will control the whole eco system and bitcoin's main objective will fail. 

So this is a plead to the OG's and whales that have a substantial amount of BTC to take into consideration the bankers final attack on BTC and tread carefully. 

We are losing the war whether we like it or not cause 90% of the population is dumb.",1520729657,11/03/2018 00:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83jffw/bitcoin_whales_you_are_at_danger/,0

Started using Bisq decentralized exchange. Great experience.,"I started using Bisq decentralized exchange and I have had a great experience. I used to use Coinbase when I first started buying crypto, but the outrageous amount of time it took to transfer USD from my bank to Coinbase/GDAX forced me to find an alternative (not to mention Coinbase data being plundered by the IRS).

I had one problem with Bisq, and it was my first trade. For some reason there was an error and an arbitrator had to come in and help. The issue lasted a few days but in the end the seller got their BTC back (and I never lost my cash). It was a pretty smooth process, and even though it was a problem, the way it was handled gave me confidence in the application/technology.

All of my other trades have gone smooth and I have security knowing my personal dealings can stay private and away from plunder.

Currently there have been between 5-20 trade offers at any given time, which is way up from what it was just a month ago but is still low. This limits my trading abilities, but with more regulation attempts will come more users :)

EDIT: 5-20 USD/BTC trade offers, and many more with other national currencies and/or altcoins.

I definitely recommend any readers to try using Bisq!",1520741692,11/03/2018 04:14:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83kitg/started_using_bisq_decentralized_exchange_great/,169

"Warning, possible FUD question ahead.","I think I just understood something about the market. Yah, I’m a n00b, but that’s no excuse.
So, just like how the holders of a currency could theoretically conspire together to only sell at a very high price, and thus make all of them potentially rich, so could an agency crash a currency if they accumulated enough power and then strategically used it to both change the price and expectation of the price and sentiment simultaneously.  I swung back and forth on the Mt. Gox thing recently, thinking that it was bad during the FUD because he has so much left to sell, then thinking it was good because he both probably wasn’t going to sell the rest and because the market had absorbed all of his panic at its absolute worst and then rebounded on top of that.  Now however I am again worried, because there is a psychological side effect of his panic selling that I didn’t think about, going on inside my own head: hope.  Hope and despair both happen on the way down in a market and the way up.  Because of the whale panic sale, I am now very hopeful for buying down around 6-7K, and excited for possibly even lower.  I now EXPECT that lower overall value of bitcoin, because I know there was at least one megawhale willing to sell down there.  I can thus pick btc up supercheap and make a f’ck ton right?! Nope.  That lowering of expectation is now possibly going to be a self-reinforcing prophesy.  And the capitulation is no longer coming on the way up, where I am so scared I will never get a lower price that I buy in at the top. No, now I am certain I will get a better price. I expect it. And finally the capitulation will now be that I can no longer get a higher price for my sale because it is driven down by traders, like myself, selling just below each previous high. Thoughts?

"To all the people disappointed with their investment (in bitcoin) performance. Please do as a favor, cut your losses short and spare us the nagging about bubbles and all the negatives you clearly see now (but couldn't see when the price was going up)","For the ones that are thinking to invest now please take Andreas Antonopoulos advice and invest in it as much as you understand it. If you feel that you understand 5% invest 5% but more importantly if you understand 0% invest 0% and no, ""Block-chain is this new technology that will change the world"" does not count as understanding. Take your money and put them somewhere that you feel comfortable with. The problem with all the recent FUD and negativity lies with the fact that 90% of the people in crypto are mostly people who ""invested"" at the end of 2017, and 99% of them the only reason they had in doing so was the price. When the only reason you have when you buy something is the belief that you are going to sell it for more guess what happens when the price drops. You are left with no reasons. No reasons to be in it. When your money are into something for no reason you panic, you loose your sleep, you get angry, you discover all the reasons why you shouldn't have invested in it. Please do your self a favor and educate yourself's. Try to understand and if you want to HODL do it for a reason other than the price. I am heavily invested and I sleep like a baby. And if I loose everything is going to be because of something I didn't see happening before it happened (and nothing of the sort has happened yet). Not something that I wish I knew (and I could have known) before I invested. In fact ""investing"" is not even the right word to use. ""Backing up"" the technology is...If you are here for the money please leave. If you are here because of the way the future can unfold (outside the potential coin price increase) then enjoy the ride. What I see now (all the work, the ideas, the ongoing development) if you take out the price visibility is so positive that I wonder where do the people find the FUD? If you can not then stick with the bloomberg, the FT and the CNBC articles that you so much like. They all have one common characteristic. All of them fail to accept that the current technology is continuously developing and what is today is going to be much better in a year. If you can not relate to what I am saying have a look at that article about why iphone will fail from 2006:

Noob question on (Mt. Gox) sell offs and other manipulators...,"This seems so obvious that I can't help think I must have missed something, but here goes... I think we're all aware of the drops due to gox sell offs this week. So it would seem that a massive BTC sale will drop the price by a very noticable amount. So that begs me to ask the question: If a whale can sell when the price is high, what's to stop them then buying back when it's at a lower price, waiting for it to recover somewhat, then selling the same amount again for extra profit?

Although I can see that there's the risk that rebuying is a bad idea if you've inspired mass FUD, so the price keeps dropping, but it seems to me if you're hoarding 100s or 1000s of BTC, then it makes sense to try and rinse and repeat this strategy indefinitely. It seems a rather unscrupulous way of making money.",1520763450,11/03/2018 10:17:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83lyer/noob_question_on_mt_gox_sell_offs_and_other/,2

Dyson sphere mining,"That Forbes article about banning all cryptomining got me thinking. He isn’t the first... and certainly won’t be the last voice calling for cryptomining. People like him don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, the value of decentralized cryptomining and that it supersedes this big scary monster of illicit crypto mining. 

But an idea came up. Years and perhaps decades into the future, cryptomining and decentralized blockchains will need greater sources of power. I imagine that generating that power on earth would prove costly and perhaps become an environmental menace. I’m not saying it is a menace now but it could become one.

The security we get with bitcoin’s decentralized trustless proof of work protocol comes at a price of greater energy. I imagine once the world appreciates the value of this security, they’ll begin making other energy-intensive blockchains where energy is needed to secure their proof of work blockchains. 

Imagine that energy being harnessed in space, via a network of Dyson sphere-like devices that collect energy from the sun at various places in our solar system. All we’d need is automated computers running nodes and specialized mining machines, connected to the internet via satellites. 

Now imagine the security and value that would bring about. Encrypted data on an interplanetary blockchain powered by decentralized mining machines collecting energy from the sun. In that scenario... we could have a true universal basic income for literally everybody on earth, in space stations, on moon bases, and Martian settlements, with a secure crypto currency. 

What this means for bitcoin is that the energy to keep the network going doesn’t have to be relegated to on-earth operations. And since the last 21 millionth bitcoin isn’t due for another 100 years, I imagine space travel and energy requirements to power the bitcoin blockchain and the many others that will arise will all be competing for energy efficiency. 

A Dyson sphere-like network would sure be interesting to see. ",1520773924,11/03/2018 13:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83mmfn/dyson_sphere_mining/,2

Question about the Lightning Network with respect to use vs capacity requirements.,"I haven't ever seen this discussed. My question is as follows:-

Imagine a successful routing node, part of the lightning network, well connected and no KYC etc - so it is a popular node for us to connect to.

The capacity of the node needs to be enough that when we are sending our payments through this node the value can be temporarily locked, right? 

On this basis a routing node has a specific capacity requirement depending on the size of payments that will be routed and the number of people trying to do it.

Does this mean that nodes will need to ""over-fill"" their capacity such that at any one time there is more than enough available to be transacted with given their average user usage? This would be done to prevent transactions dropping mid-way, which would mean the customer whos routing failed needs to have a ""time-out"" to receive the funds back - an inconvenience. 

Given this would a node operator not need to, in order to provide a consistent high standard of service, monitor and control connections/usage to ensure uninterrupted service for the users of the particular node?

Would really appreciate some insight on this.",1520787591,11/03/2018 16:59:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83nxbk/question_about_the_lightning_network_with_respect/,3

I've been reading up a lot about alternatives to coinbase and have read a whole lot of conflicting information and really am no closer to finding one than before I started reading.  As soon as I think I am hearing good things about one, I read really bad things about it somewhere else.  

I am interested in an exchange that is good for a US citizen to sell some BTC infrequently for USD to a US bank account.

The secondary choice would be to sell for cash in person using one of those options.  Would like to get opinions on those options also.

My mom works in finance and had some interesting things to say about Bitcoin,"I was surprised that she was ""all for it"".

She has worked in forensic accounting, CPA,  and compliance, so it surprised me since I expected her to be conservative with her thoughts on it as an investment.

She's also very religious, so I expected her to say something about ""the number of the beast"" but she answered that before I had a chance to ask:

""I remember back in the 60's when Visa and Mastercard became a thing and people didn't understand those either...they said all these things about *the number of the beast* in church about credit cards and it sounded as crazy then to me as it does now...Bitcoin WILL BE the world currency someday...we live in a SciFi future I wished for as a kid...what's the next big thing?""",1520793747,11/03/2018 18:42:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83omm9/my_mom_works_in_finance_and_had_some_interesting/,266

How to check if your Electrum Wallet is legit before using. (For Linux),"First, you need ThomasV fingerprint.

* gpg --recv-keys 7F9470E6

or

* gpg --keyserver 7F9470E6

Go back to Electrum [website](https://electrum.org/#download) and download Electrum-3.1.0.tar.gz and its signature Electrum-3.1.0.tar.gz.asc

Copy all the 3 files to the same folder, open the terminal and use command 'cd' to navigate to that folder and run these commands.

* gpg --import ThomasV.asc

* gpg --verify Electrum-3.1.0.tar.gz.asc Electrum-3.1.0.tar.gz

If the message returned says Good signature and that it was signed by ThomasV with a fingerprint that ends with 7F9470E6, then the software is authentic.

Reminder: Bitcoin is still less than a rounding error on the global balance sheet. These Alex Jones-like conspiracy theories are hilarious + absurd,"Every other post sounds like some lunatic ranting about an evil international conspiracy against bitcoin. Which sends a chill down my spine because maybe the last place on earth I want to be is on their side and opposed to Warren Buffet on any issue, let alone an investment proposition lmao.

Anyway I think many of you are overestimating how much people care about bitcoin. Economists and others might think it’s stupid. I disagree - there’s real promise in a decentralized digital store of value with strong liquidity and a hard cap on supply.  But reasonable minds can disagree and I can still respect them and not assume they’re on some anti-crypto jihad. Grow the fuck up guys.  

Relatedly, I think you’re grossly overestimating bitcoin’s importance in the current financial system. Bitcoin remains a drop inside a drop in the global economy bucket. People are much, much more interested in how the fed will unwind QE and whether they’ll boost rates three times this year. Plus, you know, financial assets that represent legal claims on the cash flows of actual irl businesses.

A fool and his money are soon parted.,"Today, minutes ago, i was on newegg, finally finding an in stock 1080ti for only $959! what a steal! i've been planning on building from scratch for a few weeks to replace my shitty laptop! perfect opportunity to spend 2 grand on a spec'd out build.

So i tally up the order, plug in my TREZOR, get ready to pay and then i get floored by bitpays payment protocol, which isnt supported by Trezor, after some researching and futile attempts at loading up my trezor wallet into mycelium and electrum, and bitpay/copay itself,  I just for a MOMENT considered selling out, and paying in cash in a few days. 

NOPE, these gpu's sell out so quickly...PCMASTERRACE BECKONS

So i send my money(not all of my crypto, but all of my current bitcoin) to my bitcoin core client. i clicked send, and clicked twice on my trezor to send.
 All's well, in a few minutes after the confirmations ill get my bitpay invoice and be on my way to 120 fps land.

Then my heart sank and adrealine started pumping.
I have forgotten the password to my bitcoin core wallet. Each confirmation another nail in my coffin.

BACKUP YOUR SHIT THEN BACK IT UP AGAIN

If i manage to find the piece of paper that has my password on it (likely at my parents house or destroyed) then great, i get my money back, but this should of never happened and i feel like i should know better after reading this same type of story over and over again.

The passwords not too long but i know it's a string of random letters and numbers, so maybe one day in the future when bitcoin is worth millions i will be able to contract someone to brute force it, and of course i have the wallet file, so i'm thinking of it as a super time locked cryo storage solution.

Almost 50% of bitcoin transactions are batched,"I added information about batched transactions to my [bitcoin fee statistics program](https://github.com/fresheneesz/bitcoinFeeStatistics), and was surprised to find that almost half of transactions are batched. Batching is also twice as common for legacy transactions, which leads me to think that a lot more exchanges have implemented batching than segwit (which makes sense for them since batching saves them more in fees than segwit).

"Forbes article: ""We Need To Shut Bitcoin And All Other Cryptocurrencies Down. Here's Why."" + My Response","[We Need To Shut Bitcoin And All Other Cryptocurrencies Down.

You've got to be kidding me with this absolute garbage. Read it for yourself, but the guy is wrong about almost everything he says. It looks like clickbait, but it's in Forbes and I thought Forbes was a respectable publication. When are journalists going to start taking their publications seriously when it comes to cryptocurrency? Why is this Jason Bloomberg dope the ""president"" of a tech company?

I got so incensed about it that I pushed out [a response article of my own](https://medium.com/@malcolmrosegaming/jason-bloomberg-is-totally-clueless-heres-why-498db2e203e). Read it and give me some feedback, or don't -- either way, understand that this is the kind of ignorance we're up against in the crypto world. Dinosaurs who think that the whole idea of a decentralized system is so dangerous that it should just be *made illegal*.

""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" It looks like we're getting to the ""fight you"" stage.

Bitcoin mining cost,"I read somewhere in December 2017 that the average mining cost of 1 BTC is around $5k in USA. Assuming that the price will never fall below this cost (too many people, businesses, hardware manufacturers etc involved in the BTC) I think we could assume that the minimum price should follow the mining difficulty. I made a simple extrapolation graph which shows that the minimum price by the end of 2018 is approx. $25k

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/bcCYpQq.jpg)

This is obviously not taking into account mining hardware being faster and faster and assumes the mining difficulty growing at min linear pace.

Majestic Repertory Theatre First Non-Profit Theatre Company to Accept Bitcoin,"Majestic Repertory Theatre has become the first non-profit theatre company in North America to accept Bitcoin as currency for tickets, merchandise and tax-deductible donations. Downtown Las Vegas's intimate storefront theatre has taken bold strides since it formed in 2016 - its pursuit of excellence has led to several ""best of"" awards by local publications and organizations. ""The vision of Majestic Rep is to find in Las Vegas the voices that will change American Theatre,"" said artistic director Troy Heard. ""We work to achieve that through a tri-fold dedication to education, diversity and community.""

""The local arts in our city benefit from a relationship with the world famous Las Vegas Strip. We have access to some of the world's finest performers and designers who look to supplement their repertoire by working with us and our interns,"" Heard says. ""Additionally, we have found very progressive international travelers who wander off the beaten path in search of local flavor. Because of this, we have added the option to purchase tickets and merchandise using Bitcoin. Right now we use Bitpay in person at the box office, but hope to fully integrate an option with our online ticketing system. Additionally, we have accepted charitable donations in the form of Bitcoin.""

Looking for Help Starting out on Bitmining,"I have a fairly good pc. A liquid cooled, 3gb GTX1060, 6700k cpu and 16 gigs of RAM. I was hoping to purchase a GTX1070, but the mining prices made it quite hard for me. The ridiculous prices left me thinking: Why not join the mining craze? I did a little research and came up with nicehash. which seems to pay in decent amounts. Now my research left me with a few questions: Most of the discussions of risks of Bitcoin have to do with investment, which really isn't a problem in my case as the only investment is electricity (Which I doubt will go up by a noticeable amount) and wallets getting hacked. Again, I haven't really done work, so not an issue. Questions that were not answered, are what are the personal risks involved? I have heard of ransomware viruses that target bitcoin mining PCs, but I think they would only be an issue if I had a virus on my PC in the first place.  I am currently dependent on my family. Could I be placing my family in any sort of financial risk by mining? (Even on such a tiny scale) They say if something is too good to be true, it probably is. I am sure that's the case here to, but I am hoping to figure out if the thing that's too good to be true here are the profit margins, or the whole system altogether.

This is a script in python than you can use for monitoring MtGox money movement. Just install blockchain module with `pip install blockchain` in your linux box. and add `*/10  *  * * *  user PYTHONPATH=/home/user/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ /usr/bin/python2 /usr/local/bin/get_gox.py` in your /etc/crontab file and put the code above in /usr/local/bin/get_gox.py. In ten minutes you will be notified by your email that MtGox money were withdrawn from their wallets. Just replace yourmail@yourdomain.com and user word with your own. MTA configuration will be your own problem) As an example of a common MTA /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf:

    root=yourname@gmail.com
    mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587

Best bank/CC to use to buy bitcoin?,"Curious to those who use bank ACH or credit/debit cards to purchase bitcoin, what bank do you use?

Bank of America credit card has been a giant mess trying to buy bitcoin. Kept getting fraud holds and having to go into the bank to lift them, kept getting told my next purchase would go through, it wouldnt, and eventually one woman in the fraud department told me ""yeah, we dont support buying bitcoin you can't do that""

My credit union also told me that they don't support investing in bitcoin and I shouldn't do it, though I am still able to buy bitcoin using it. (usually after getting declined 1st purchase then okay-ing it with the bank)

And lastly, wells fargo (when I was foolish enough to bank with those crooks) credit card gave me a ton of headache, but eventually after a few days of numerous calls and trying repeatedly I could get a transaction to go through.

Would be cool to get a list going of banks/cards that either allow you or don't allow you to buy bitcoin, as this is the defining factor on the next credit card I apply for, I dont want to waste the hard inquiry and all that on a card that doesnt support bitcoin.",1520843289,12/03/2018 08:28:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83tft8/best_bankcc_to_use_to_buy_bitcoin/,2

Challenging legacy banking,"Our blockchain based platform enables its community to store, save, spend, receive, borrow and get insured, with a simplified user experience in a legally compliant way. Ultimately, Cashaa aims to become a one-stop-shop for financial needs – says Janina Lowisz, Co-Founder &amp; VP Marketing at Cashaa, in Bithub.pl’s #SundayInterview.

**Is token sale a reliable way of funding a startup company?**

**Janina Lowisz:** *Although an increasing effort is needed and there can be numerous surprises and obstacles on the way, it is still possible get a good amount via a token sale only, e.g. Cashaa received 33 million USD in a token sale in 2017, out of which 14 million was rejected due to strict AML and KYC policy setup by us. The amount accepted will be enough to launch or next generation banking wallet and card and expand it worldwide, as intended.*

I think it is important to own bitcoin and land. The former for a truly advanced future civilization and the latter in case we fail to replace oil.,"Just a thought. 

If we don't overcome our energy problems, we will probably face a very different system, with a lot of less available energy per capita and no growth. That means that owning land would be of much more importance than it is today. Not to become rich, but to be able to grow your own food, mainly. 

In case we unlocked something like nuclear fusion, with lots and lots of more available energy, we will probably face a true globalization with one single currency. Bitcoin is the way to go.

So tldr: buy bitcoin and land.",1520856236,12/03/2018 12:03:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83ufp3/i_think_it_is_important_to_own_bitcoin_and_land/,1

Easiest way to gift bitcoin?,"The audience in question might not be that tech savvy, the goal is to be able to gift them bitcoin and they should be able to access the coins easily to spend it or to tell others their BTC address so they can collect coins from whatever it is they might do.

This is a question I was asked by a medium size organization that does contests and giveaways, very honest good group of people. They are serious about adding bitcoin giveaways and asked me to point them in the right direction, so here I am reaching out as so far the options I found might not be the easiest way. (having the winner download a wallet app etc, if this is the best way ill advise them that).

How to remove proxyban/whitelist bitcointalk account without paying $20+ in transaction fee,"Hi,

I just signed up for a bitcointalk account and I am unable to post anything with that account as it was proxy banned and needs to be whitelisted (well, I didn't do anything, probably the guy who rented the house earlier did something evil there).

I know that there are some ways to create a new account and avoid such hassle. But I prefer this account name and the email address that I am using.

Is there any way to get this account whitelisted without paying so much on bitcoin fee? I know that it doesn't cost much for the fee itself, only 1869 satoshi, but there is minimum withdrawal amount for bitcoin from my Binance account, and also huge transaction fee (I estimated that there is no way for me to do it for less than $20).

Thanks!",1520869523,12/03/2018 15:45:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83vwld/how_to_remove_proxybanwhitelist_bitcointalk/,2

Samourai wallet to be exact.  I have a bitcoin ATM not far from me just to get started and put about $100 USD.  I say about $100 because of the 8% fee.  

I also understand that is is bad to keep any real BC on a web brokerage like Coinbase but I do like the fact that I can sign up on there and I can buy and sell.  I also like the fact that I can use gift cards and convert them into BC.  What I don't like is the idea of needing to enter personal banking info to join coinbase.

Bitcoin Node Port Issue,"Hey guys. So a couple months ago, I set up a full node using a Digital Ocean Droplet.

After a few months, I decided to finally bring my node home. The node is all setup, currently syncing the chain, but I am having a few issues.

I can not get my port open on my network, in order to see my node outside my network. Right now, I have 8 active connections, which I know is the standard for when you aren't connected to any outside nodes.

My node is on a Raspberry Pi. I have given it, it's own static ip. I have assigned that static to the pi and also open ip it's ports (8333) for that static ip. 

When I run the following: 

    curl -sL https://bitnodes.earn.com/api/v1/nodes/me-8333/  
I get the output:

    {""success"":false}

My ISP is Comcast, I am using an AirPort Extreme, and I have a Arris modem. Now I have tried connecting to that modem, and I can't do that. That would be my final troubleshoot, would be connecting to that. But my default gateway address just times out. And when I connect to it using another address, it just shows info about the modem and nothing you can edit.

I am really stuck, and I would love to get this back to a node that connects with everyone else. ",1520882559,12/03/2018 19:22:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83xoux/bitcoin_node_port_issue/,5

Another demonstration of the power of Bitcoin: Craigslist,"As a long time Bitcoin enthusiast, I never appreciated the fraud protection Bitcoin provides until I had to move.  I posted several items on Craigslist and was overwhelmed with scammers.

Some of the scams aren't even obvious, for instance: ""Give me your name and address and I'll send you a cashier's check.  Once the check clears, I'll send a mover to pick up the item"".

Anyways, simply requesting payment in bitcoin and providing an address ends all the games immediately.  I don't need to provide any sensitive information and payment is immediately obvious.

Buy and Sell used books on OpenBazaar,"The one thing that can really accelerate Bitcoin adoption and support the price is a fertile market transacting in Bitcoin. If you haven't heard of OpenBazaar before, it is a peer-to-peer marketplace where you can use nearly 20 different cryptos to buy goods. The seller receives Bitcoin (I believe it uses ShapeShifter to change coins).

Everyone should check out OpenBazaar and I specifically recommend buying and selling used books on there. Selling books through Amazon or Ebay costs up to 40% of the selling price in fees whereas on OpenBazaar the only fee is a transaction fee. Books are especially easy to sell online in the US because of the low cost of USPS Media mail. Just trying to raise awareness!

also include several more traits. An

My question is, would storing my seed in a text file on a persistent volume on a TAILS usb (fresh OS install, verified signature, never connect it to the internet, waterproof/fireproof usb) be a safe option for digitally storing a seed?

‘We’re not really interested’: Quebec throws cold water on Bitcoin miners seeking cheap power,,1520904527,13/03/2018 01:28:47,http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/quebec-throws-cold-water-on-bitcoin-miners-seeking-cheap-power,1
A little FUD for all you chuckleheads,"Let me tell you about my first experience purchasing something with BTC.

After doing the old fashioned HODL for a while I've decided it was time to do a  SPEDN and see what this system is all about.  What better time than to sell the dip, amirite?

So, I set out to purchase myself a hardware wallet so I could protect all those altcoins I'm gonna be shilling after this SPEDN inevitably proves to me how dead BTC really is.

I signed into the most secure internet browser ever made (ie6) and went over to Ledger's website to make purchase.  Within a couple minutes I had checked some boxes and typed in some form fields.  So far this seems just like regular old internet browsing.  Hitting that checkout button I'm prompted to send my BTC through BitPay.  I scan the QR code and submit my payment.

At this point a giant capital F descended from my celing, and punched me right in the face!  I was afraid (I was petrified) that my transaction might not go through!  Was 3sat/byte going to confirm in enough time?  Could I really get away with a mere nickel in fees on a purchase from France?

Uncertain of what was lower, my fee or Trump's approval ratings, I suddenly noticed my transaction had already confirmed.  It had been less than two minutes and I was already in a block, right next to someone's transaction for a pumpkin spice latte that finally made it through and onto the chain from October.

Doubtful, I couldn't believe my eyes.  For just a nickel in fees, I was able to order something from 3000 miles away without having to enter anything more than a shipping address.  It confirmed in less than 2 minutes, and Satoshi himself rang my doorbell to shake my hand.  He's not as tall as I'd expected...",1520904664,13/03/2018 01:31:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/840gem/a_little_fud_for_all_you_chuckleheads/,0

The 4 Years Legacy of Bolivian Bitcoin Ban.,"Bolivia had became one of the first world countries which officially banned Bitcoin. In May 2014, El Banco Central de Bolivia come out with the statement, which postulated that taking away citizens' right to freely access XXI century's most technologically advanced and economically efficient form of payment would be highly beneficial not only for the stability of local currency - ""boliviano"", which has already lost 70% of its value in the past 50 years - but also for preserving impeccable ethical norms withing the Bolivian society on its traditionally high levels.

In that retrograde motion Bolivian bureaucrats preceded analogous actions of their likewise minded and vigilant colleagues from Ecuador (July 2014), Kyrgyzstan (August 2014), Bangladesh (September 2014) and Nepal (July 2017). Almost four years have already passed since this notable event in the history of Bolivian resistance to the forth technological revolution, which has spread across the globe, but any positive signs, which may validate it in the eyes of posterity, are still absent from local economic barometers.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: not friendly;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: mobile social networks, entertainments, e-games, e-commerce, FinTech;
major limitations: slowing economy (GDP growth rate dropped to under four percents in 2017 from seven percents in 2014), low middle-income population (per-capita less than four thousands dollars), high level of inequality (Gini 48), under-developed infrastructure (fixed Internet penetration rate is around forty percents), relatively low urbanization rate (under seventy percents);
stimulus: comparatively large population (over eleven million), low costs, growing number of mobile Internet users;
opportunities: to create a local e-business aimed at mobile Internet users living in Santa-Cruz in such sectors as entertainments, e-commerce and FinTech.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): Not Legal (negative).

Possible Hack Of Third-Party Tools Affects Binance Exchange Users,"Users of Binance, the top cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trade volume, are reporting suspicious activity in their accounts stemming from an apparent hack on Reddit, March 7.

Binance has stated that the issues stem from third-party tools and that “there is no evidence” of the platform itself being compromised. The only users affected are those who have issued API keys on their accounts.

Reddit user shashankkgg originally posted in the Binance Exchange subreddit that all of their altcoins were sold at market rate.

Another Redditor wrote “My balance dropped by 25%, I now have VIA and 3 of my coins were sold in their entirety. I bought one of them back, only to have it sold again.”

According to their post on Reddit, Binance stated it is investigating user reports of “issues with [users’] funds.”

While Binance is investigating the issue, they have disabled all withdrawals.

Moderators of the CryptoCurrency subreddit recommend several courses of action for traders using a portfolio management tool or third-party trade bots that use Binance API keys. These include disabling those accounts on Binance or the tools themselves, disabling trade access to the API on Binance, or resetting the API key.",1520925836,13/03/2018 07:23:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/842axi/possible_hack_of_thirdparty_tools_affects_binance/,0

Do mined coins show up on blockchain explorers and can the balance of the addresses that mined the coins be seen?,"Somebody wants to do a deal for a bitcoin transaction but when proof of the coins is required they say that the coins will not show up on blockchain.info as they were ""mined coins"".


Is this really true? Will mined coins really not show up on blockchain.info for the address' balance?


If that is the case how can proof of funds of bitcoins be seen before the deal goes through?

edit: 

apparently now they say that the reason the coins will not show on blockchain.info is because all of these mined coins have been stored offline once generated.

My colleague is there in person and said he has been shown the balances on bitcoin core by the sellers using bitcoind to access private keys. 

Does this make sense. Can block explorers not view the balances of wallets in cold storage?",1520926714,13/03/2018 07:38:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/842d7b/do_mined_coins_show_up_on_blockchain_explorers/,5

We did what a trustworthy mining pool should do: Resuming S9 cloud contracts maintenance fee &amp; Reopening cloud mining contract Market,"Hi there, I’m a staff of Social Media in ViaBTC. Please allow me to introduce our pool’s latest adjustment.

Recently, due to policy changes in the past months, some of our long-term hosting partners are facing a crisis of farm closure as mining resources in Mainland China become more scarce, leading to rocketing costs of our cloud mining operation. To guarantee the long run of cloud mining, ViaBTC has no choice but have to readjust our maintenance fees. The arrangements are as follows:


S9 contracts: From UTC time 8:00 12th January 2018, maintenance fee ratio for S9 contracts will be temporarily adjusted from 6% to 50%. 

If users disagree with our temporary readjustment of maintenance fees, they could choose to terminate S9 cloud mining contracts in advance.

The surging cost of ViaBTC cloud mining contracts left us with no choice but to readjust maintenance fees of S9 contracts from January 11th, 2018 and we’ve also offered chances to terminate S9 cloud mining contracts in advance for those who disagreed with the fee adjustment.

Now ViaBTC has resumed mining operation and made the following arrangements to ViaBTC cloud mining contracts:

From March 2nd, 2018 (UTC time), we resumed maintenance fee of S9 cloud mining contracts, bringing it down from 50% to the original 6%.

We’ve resumed contracts maintenance as promised. And we are still trying our best to provide high-quality cloud mining service in the best interest of our users. 

We’re open for comments. If you’re interested in our pool or have any opinion, let us know in the comments section below.",1520928563,13/03/2018 08:09:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/842hq6/we_did_what_a_trustworthy_mining_pool_should_do/,3

Running Bitcoin nodes behind a load balancer,"Hey,

Anyone out there have any experience running 2 or more Bitcoin Wallets behind a load balancer? I am researching a HA node solution for payments. Very early days at this stage as i'm still information gathering. 

For example if disk read/write speeds get too high I can offload some transactions to another independent node. I don't think this will be too hard to achieve but wondering if anyone has come across any gotchas or simply if there is any advice you can give.

Thanks in advance.

How I ended up a 2 Bitcoin – an extremely short story.,"Last year I was going to meet some friends at a local bar to talk some crypto over beer, as they were starting to get into it. I got there a bit early to get us a table, and then ordered a beer, waiting on my friends.

The manager started some conversation with me as he noticed my Crypto shirt, was curious as he saw it mentioned on a business show and he started to ask me some questions about it. He was really into it. I brought up the advantages, efficiency, and its roots and mentioned how it gives us a choice to go around what is sometimes a corrupt banking system. That made things get a bit hot as he totally believed in our financial system and I started laying down examples of the inherent corruption.  

Anyways, to make a long story short, things escalated and were now a bit too heated; Customers were starting to look over and so he asked me to leave. At this point I had no problem leaving but asked for his name and business card, he complied. He then asked for my name but I started to leave, not seeing the point since I was a customer. As I was approaching the the front door, he again asked for my name – I turned around and shouted some choice words, ending with “ I’m Jay Coyne you A** H***! See you in court!”

Making my way out the door, he screamed - “You’re nothing but a 2 Bit Coyne.”

BTC denominated debt: can bitcoin really end war?,"I've always assumed that, thanks to ever increasing value, bitcoin would make borrowing money untenable, and therefore prevent countries from using debt to fund wars. Forced to rely on current fund and taxation, we'd return to the more limited war of the pre 20th-century era, and perhaps have a shot at ending it altogether.

However, a comment on another thread made me realize that lending might still be widespread under a deflationary bitcoin economy. Simply put, rather than the borrower paying interest, the lender would pay. I imagine lending as a sort of futures contact: the lender is betting that the future value of the principle is greater than the value any other currently available venture would bring. So why couldn't this bet simply be made in the other direction?

I'm posting this to find out if anyone can suggest why I'm not seeing this correctly.",1520938866,13/03/2018 11:01:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/843a4v/btc_denominated_debt_can_bitcoin_really_end_war/,0

We are in the cleansing phase of crypto - where the alts that should never have had high value are steadily bleeding out. This cleansing is a necessary step to enable the next step up for Bitcoin.,"In the past 30 days, Bitcoin is up 7.2% and only 5 coins have performed better than Bitcoin in fiat value change. And of those, only Litecoin has a market cap that puts in among the major coins. All other coins have lost value compared to Bitcoin. During this same time that Bitcoin is +7%, Bcash is -20%, for example.

This phase is a healthy and necessary and welcome cleansing of the market. When it completes, Bitcoin will take its next leg up in value to new ATH.

Friend's little bro wants to convince strictly academic parents that BTC is not an illegal scam. Help?,"So my friend's little brother is freaking out because his strictly academic parents(yes, the ""go to Harvard"" type) found out he likes Bitcoin. And the thing is, his parents think Bitcoin is an entire scam and is illegal and little bro will go to jail when he grows up(because of all the Bitcoin story scams).

So, in an effort to help this little bro of the crypto community, I need help convincing his parents it isn't a scam, and it is NOT illegal. I've already tried telling them ""it's another type of currency, you just can't see it"" but they're like, ""if you can't see it, if you can't feel it, then you don't even know if it is real.""

Oh, and they're like, ""oh, and iskrea, read the news. bitcoin is all over the news: 'scam!' 'so-and-so exchange hacked!' 'bitcoin miners arrested!'

me: so um.

Trying to access my wallet that I haven't opened in years. Does it normally take a week to get all the blockchain updates?,"I bought a few bitcoins back in 2012 or so, and after deciding I wasn't going to be spending them in the near future decided to transfer them to a personal wallet instead of leaving them in coinbase.  I used bitcoin-Qt.  I tried accessing my wallet last weekend to see what was in it and it said it needed to update the blockchain first, fair enough.

Well it started at 304 weeks last saturday, and nearly 72 hours later it has 178 weeks to go.  Is that normal?  Is there anything I can do to speed it up?  Given that I'm assuming the number of transactions increased over time, I'm guessing that each subsequent week will take longer than the preceding week, so this could take weeks to finally update at this speed.

"TRUE OR FALSE?: Hardware wallets are useful for the safe keeping of BTC even if your goal is to HODL your bitcoin for years to come. Here is why the answer is TRUE, and how hardware wallets can be made even more useful (Trezor firmware feature request).","The trick to keeping your bitcoin safe is to keep your keys secret and secure. You can keep your handwritten keys in a titanium vault with 24/7 armed guards and still have your bitcoin taken if someone has seen those keys before you put them in the vault. Secret key generation for non-technical folks can be near impossible. Keeping those keys safe is also hard - but not as hard. Many non-technical people are better equipped to keep some words written on paper secret than they are at using entropy correctly to establish those words in the first place while in a secure environment. There are many websites and videos out there that will explain how to run certain Javascript tools on air-gapped client browsers running on Linux distributions (see iancoleman.io/bip39), but how likely is a non-technical person likely to perform the required steps correctly? The odds are near zero.

The Trezor hardware wallet represents the easiest way for a non-technical person to securely generate new BTC keys in the form of BIP0039 mnemonic code words. The wallet uses two sources of entropy (the host computer and the Trezor itself), and it will display the mnemonic code only once (presumably the user requests these backup words immediately after wallet initialization).

So to anyone that considers themself non-technical, best practices for keeping any non-trivial amount of BTC safe include getting yourself a hardware wallet such as Trezor, even if the only reason is to generate your keys (there are in fact many other more obvious reasons to use the Trezor).

Some folks are nervous about the entropy sources of the Trezor. Everyone should be nervous about all entropy sources on which the security of their BTC relies. Here is how the Trezor team can strengthen the user’s confidence that her keys are not low quality and are not easily defeated:

Please allow the user to flip a coin 256 times (or roll a casino die 100 times) and enter the result, one at a time, into the Trezor during the onboarding process. Using the exclusive-or function to merge these data with the 2 types of entropy already present will not negatively impact the amount of final entropy, even if very non-random data is entered by the user. The peace of mind provided by allowing me to enter my own entropy, while retaining the natural advantages of a purpose-built dedicated hardware platform for generating secret keys, will be greatly appreciated.

Satoshi Labs: Great product! Please provide a means for the user to enter and merge her own entropy into your key generation process. Thank you!

Bitcoin-Tumbling service (University Project),"hello guys,

my teacher was so nice and inform us , that the hole class has to take bitcoin projects and i was thinking to take a bitcoin fork project, but my teacher destroyed my dreams and gave me a Tumbeling service for bitcoins. I was like maaaah ok whatever  ;). Now we have to define : 

**Scope of work and requirement definitions
Main functions necessary for the platform 
User stories
And wireframes development.
what makes your tumbeling servervice better then others (BAAAANG this question shocked me almost, what would you say?)
additional functions from our side based on professional experience**

but i dont know how to bring these simple questions to a bulletprof project. (IVE NEVER DONE A BITCOIN PROJECT OR HAVE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE BUT ITS INTERESTING) 






my point of view:

Everything should run on a VPS (if its possible Full node + Config)
An Clearweb and onion website with Bitcoin Core running on the back end.

Exchange Api’s (3rd party) or should they run a Fullnode.
I wouldn’t rely on a public APIs, not only, because they are unreliable but if I want to hide my server, then I can only do requests to them with Tor and I noticed many times these APIs suddenly stop accepting requests over Tor or using all kind of rate limiting. 3rd party services, I don't have any issues with it. But some people suggested that it might be less secure than using a wallet locally on my server.
I think the best option is running your own full node (e.g. bitcoin core) and then on your server connect to it using JSON-RPC to generate addresses and request payments. it’s just provide realiability, and more privacy.


A website mixer, they don’t provide much privacy, due to amount correlation and the wallets those are being used to interact with you are also terrible from a privacy point of view. Failing this, they want to at least have fixed denominations for your mixer, so it’d at least provide some privacy. Eg. enable mixing 0.01/ , 0.1 and 1 bitcoins, and don’t let them do something like 0.12353243 btc to be mixed, since Blockchain analysis can identify the transactions related to the mixer and based on simple amount analysis would easily reestablish the links.

*Server side bitcoin mixing (VPS) / blending / tumbling service
*Safe and non-traceable algorithm 
*Letter of Guarantee
*Bitcoin must not be on online wallets. Nobody should have the full power over Bitcoin except me.
*2FA Verification (PGP)
*Affiliate-Program (Refferal Link)
*2 to 3 additional functions (But i dont know on the customer side, i would like to have maximum privacy/security

Others:
*VPS hosting, SSL, DDOS protection incl. Cloudflare
*Extensive documentation (A to Z, Change Management, Audit)
*Everything must be able to run on a Tormirror or after a domain change
*Everything has to be ""hackproof"" and withstand later audits


Kind regards and thanks for the help

Thoughts on Mt Gox trustee and Tokoyo whale's sell off,"I think it will prove to be very good in long term. Imagine a situation where all 21 million Bitcoin have been mined and there is a certain wealth distribution where there is hige inequality of course, and everybody is HODLing. Then essentially Bitcoin is not usable at all and the price will be absolutely stagnant. Things will be much better and healthy if there is huge liquidity in exchanges, real life use cases as a global decentralised transactional currency and of course if the wealth distribution is somewhat uniform. All of these can only happen if these early adopters/whales sell their Bitcoin and we small fishes eat them. Remember, in a ecosystem if there is nothing to eat for small fishes then entire thing falls! I'll be absolutely happy if all those early whales panic sell their holding over night today. Bitcoin may go to zero in that case. But we will all rise in a big way once after that happens.

How you deal with a major flaw in Bitcoin design.,"Hi guys, I would like to know how you deal with a flaw I think many of us have when using Bitcoin as a currency in e-commerce.

Which is what happens if the merchant says they did not received your bitcoins.

This actually happed to me only once, but now I don't what to do. I bought in https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/ and they cancelled my order claiming that my order was never paid, I paid it using breadwallet and their QR code, and my transaction is in the blockchain https://blockchain.info/tx/4bece190cd1c9d2ed443fecfd2056cd238777a1b8b76e3549fa0c51bf03945f2

Their customer support said that they use Bitkassa as a payment processor so they don't have any clue about blockchain and transaction ID, I tried to contact Bitkassa but they have no phone number and they are not asnwering my emails. 

This is my first bad experience using Bitcoin as a payment, did you guys managed something similar?

Thanks for your input.",1521020752,14/03/2018 09:45:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84c51m/how_you_deal_with_a_major_flaw_in_bitcoin_design/,0

Over three million bitcoin addresses consolidated,"In January there were [14,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7k6d9b/there_are_currently_one_million_bitcoin_addresses/drcnvv4/) addresses containing 0.001 BTC or less. Now there are around [10,500,000](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html).

Low fees have prompted a huge amount of defragging, much of it at 1 sat/byte: [this one](https://blockchain.info/tx/718aa20170f552b7a307129465447511467f2830633a4f4e0c026986d12f5e64) for example consolidating tiny 824 satoshi dust particles.

The [UTXO](https://blockchain.info/charts/utxo-count?timespan=1year) has consolidated from 67.5 million to 55 million. At a rough guess, for the last several weeks about a quarter of daily volume (by MB) has been this ‘backlog’ of defragging (backlog from when high fees made it too expensive). Consolidating 12.5 million bits of dust at 148 bytes per input fills getting on for 2,000 blocks - almost 2 weeks’ worth of traffic. 

When the defrag backlog is done, and now we have segwit and batching, transacting at 1 sat/byte knowing you’ll get into the next few blocks could become the norm again.

Is Bitcoin Miner/Asic Miner banned in Europe?,"Hello everyone.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me with finding an answer.

I have been told by UPS Estonia that my shipment of miners (ordered via Bitmain) is not legal in the entire EU. She states that it is a 'new law' that bans miners importation and that I cannot even transfer my shipment to ANY European country. Is this true? Are there any place I can see or read about such law/regulations?",1521022508,14/03/2018 10:15:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84c9xa/is_bitcoin_minerasic_miner_banned_in_europe/,0

Cryptocurrency Guide for Beginners - For Basic Understanding of 55 Featured Coins,"Hello! You might remember me from the last time I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ho8rl/cryptocurrency_guide_for_beginners_gain_a_basic/). We have entered round 2 of development of our site. All of your comments and insights last time were very helpful in determining what direction and features we were to add to the site. It has been nearly completely revamped. We still have more content on the way, but I (site admin) wanted to show you guys what we've added.

My site: https://www.laymancrypto.com is a site for newcomers to gain a quick understanding of 55 featured cryptocurrencies with more to be added soon (*I know I said this last time, but we've been focusing on building a strong backend!*). We also put together useful tools that most folks are not readily familiar with such as [block explorers](https://www.laymancrypto.com/explorers/), a [glossary](https://www.laymancrypto.com/glossary/), and a [Q&amp;A](https://www.laymancrypto.com/contact/qa/) that may answer some basic questions for you. 

We still have some work to do. I will list out what we have planned in our near future:

* more coins

* more explorers

* expanded glossary

* page speed optimization

* localization (make the site multi-language friendly)

* crypto-history section (who is satoshi?)

* mining page (up on the latest coins? Ever mined the C11 algo? x16r? Xevan? *PoW isnt dead!*)

Please come check out our site and feel free to provide feedback. Love it or hate it, we can handle it - the first show of our site was a disaster (wouldn't load for android!). Hopefully this round goes a tad better.

If there is a coin you'd like to see on the site feel free to PM me. I have just been working my way through the top coins list since December so of course there's some missing here &amp; there. If you do not like a description, feel free to provide a more concise one in layman's terms and I will check it against what I have written, and additional research.

We want to be as transparent as possible, with that said here's our disclosure:

* yes, we have referral links for exchanges and crypto tools - this is our only source of income, to date we have received $0 in donations. We do not feel it negatively impacts site visitors experience, but we would like to make you aware.

* we do not use any mining plugins to steal your cpu power! we are not the type of site.

* there are currently no sponsored coins.

If you would like to read our full disclosure, you can find it [here](https://www.laymancrypto.com/disclosure/)! Thanks, hope our site is helpful.",1521023927,14/03/2018 10:38:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84ce2u/cryptocurrency_guide_for_beginners_for_basic/,0

Bitcoin Betting on WEX,"Dear WEX.nz Customers!

We introduce a new feature on our Exchange – Bitcoin Betting https://wex.bet

What is Bitcoin Betting? It’s a totalizator where Bitcoin exchange rate against USD is used.

Brief description of Bitcoin Betting Every 5 minutes, the BTC/USD exchange rate is fixed at the last price (base price), and you can bet on the rise or fall of the exchange rate in relation to the base price. After the 5-minute interval, the bets are closed, and a new 5-minute bet acceptance period with a new base price begins.

After the betting period is over, the waiting stage of the drawing begins. It lasts 5 minutes. If there are enough participants, the drawing is made after 15 minutes of waiting. At this stage, the BTC/USD exchange rate is also fixed at the last price, and the drawing is made. If you placed an up bet and the price went up, you will receive a prize as a percentage of your bet to the total amount of up bets. In this case, the prize pool is the sum of all down bets. The same algorithm is applied to down bets, but vice versa.

We wish you good luck in Bitcoin Betting!

Best Regards, WEX.nz Team :)

Block-less Chain - what's your opinion?,"Hi geeks,

I was investigating alternatives of Blockchain. From Mimblewimble to block-less chains. When I found a whitepaper on this, I found it very interesting - and wanted to share it with you. (Link: http://cchain.transaction.de/pdf/C-chainWS-pitch.pptx.pdf)

Can you say what is your opinion on this blockchain alternative? In example it is said to make more then 2k+ TX/s (!sic). All this often mentioned ""wasted"" energy for PoW would not be ""in vain"".

But for some reason Bitcoin is Bitcoin and still leading technology.

Let me know your thoughts on this - your ideas are much appreciated.

Subdued Market is a Welcome Opportunity,"Given the meteoric rise in attention and demand for Bitcoin in 2017, we saw the network struggle to accommodate the increase in transactions and new users.

The Stoic Approach to Bitcoin Price,"Price is objective, not positive or negative. That's not being a party pooper; it's called being a student of the market and being cognizant of effective risk management.

Stoics care not about controlling the market, and are open to exploring possibilities. I find it amusing that people do not consider all possibilities, and even rule out price movements that include even a *smaller* range than occurred in the same time span.

The stoic finds price neither a downer or hopeful. They are comfortable with accepting the things outside their control. It just is. Price is ephemeral. Focus attention elsewhere if it worries you.

Finally, one person's downer is another person's hope. There really are a lot more people that would benefit from accumulating at lower prices than there are people who #HODL bitcoin. Just the facts.",1521055708,14/03/2018 19:28:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84g6jj/the_stoic_approach_to_bitcoin_price/,9
An idea of bitcoin address mapping,"Hi, I have thought of an improvement to the Bitcoin network. It goes like this:

Alice wants to send Bob Bitcoin. Bob gives Alice his Bitcoin address. However, the address is very long and is prone to mistakes. If there is a way to make the address shorter and more readable (e.g. bob'sReceiving1), it would prevent any mistakes on the client's part.

##How would I go about doing this:

It would work similar to a DNS server. Included in a full Bitcoin node is a `Bitcoin address` to `custom address` table. In the table, it stores Bitcoin addresses that are mapped to a custom address assigned by the owner of the address. The table can be accessed by the public. Users can send Bitcoin using the custom address.

##Features to be implemented:

`Changing custom address` - When users want to map their Bitcoin address to a custom address, it will require a custom message (""&lt;Bitcoin address&gt; mapped to &lt;custom address&gt;"") signed by the user. The message will be broadcasted to nodes and nodes will verify the message. If the verification is successful, the node will map the Bitcoin address to the custom address of the user. Users can also remove the custom adderss by signing and broadcasting a custom message to remove mappings.

`Duplicated custom address` - When a Bitcoin address sends the custom message to map the address, the node would check for duplicates of the custom address. If there are, the node will not map the address. The wallet may be in charge of sending an error message if they do not see the address being mapped on the node. If there are 2 concurrent message that wants to map to a custom address, the node will accept the 1st message and reject the 2nd message.

`Broadcasting mappings (nodes)`- When a node receives a request to map addresses, it will map the adderss if it is verified. It then broadcast the mapping with the request message sent by the user. The next node is able to verify the message without the user sending the message himself/herself. If any changes are made to the mapping, it will be broadcasted to all nodes. If there is a bad node, it would require the node to have the custom messsage to verify the change. If no custom message is received/wrong custom message the next nodes will not apply the mapping

`Users verifying the addresses` - Users will connect to multiple nodes to check if the mapping is all the same and verified. Users are able to request for the custom message to verify the mapping. It limits the number of bad nodes on the network through verification and comparison.

Is there a project similar to this on the Bitcoin network? I would love to know if the community thinks this is a good idea.",1521056022,14/03/2018 19:33:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84g7yz/an_idea_of_bitcoin_address_mapping/,5
Alarming Centralizatization of Bitcoin in the US by Exchanges such as Coinbase &amp; Gemini as well as Bitflyer,"I will be updating this story time to time. Since last year in November, my bosses registered MSB has been trying to get onto exchanges to resell crypto to the public . So far here are the results. 

1. Gemini will not sell to other exchanges or allow them to sign up. 

2.  Coinbase does not accept accounts from start-up exchanges. 

3. Bitpay won't sell bitcoin over the counter. 


4. Bitflyer was pretty much the same. they just went silent and denied the account. 

Keep in mind the company used the top agents in the industry to put together its AML plan, is registered with Fincen, is banked and has decent capitalization and is in compliance with all regulatory bodies. 

Kraken is the only one offering a solution right now so remember that the next time someone bad mouths their site. We are still in negotiation with them and I will update with results.

The shows how hard it is for newcomers to break into the bitcoin exchange market it also shows how hard it is to cash out. How much can this market really grow if there are this many obstacles to getting in the market to create alternatives and local exchanges?

No matter how well intentioned the Winklevii are, if they do not create rules to self-govern their own body, eventually it will be corrupted from the inside out with traditional revolving door corruption practices.

We need to stand up now and say that in order for us to accept and promote such organizations to be a leader in the regulated crypto space, we want to see clauses in the Company's Ethos that designate anti-corruption practices.

-No collusion. (Organizers crafting regulation in secret with businesses to optimize pro-business/anti-consumer positions)

-No revolving doors. (Clause must disallow regulatory government agents from taking jobs within this organiztion, and vice versa, for at *least* 3 years).

"Bitcoin, year 2100.","Consider this. What if Bitcoin goes to $100,000 (or whatever), and stays there. Let's say the block reward is crap... like, really crap. Couldn't we have a deescalation in the arms race?? Why does the arms race have to only move one direction? Couldn't it become unprofitable to buy ASIC's, so people start using GPU's again? And then at some point, it just isn't worth the electrical costs to mine with a GPU at all, so all of a sudden people start securing the network with... any computer running bitcoind... mining becomes the same altruistic, green, feel-good thing that running a full node now is.",1521063622,14/03/2018 21:40:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84h7q2/bitcoin_year_2100/,3

Help my Bitcoin dissertation?,"Hello r/Bitcoin I am a student at the University of Manchester studying sociology and would like to ask your help in answering my Bitcoin related dissertation question.

It is a theoretical piece titled 'Who stands to benefit from Bitcoin?'

This is important because Bitcoin is talked about as something that can revolutionise the world and so if this is the case it is necessary to know who will benefit from this new world.

If anyone has any ideas about who they believe will benefit please comment, ideally they would be substantiated by some kind of solid evidence but I am happy to discuss any ideas!",1521063857,14/03/2018 21:44:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84h8rm/help_my_bitcoin_dissertation/,2

Be patient,"I bought this monster in 2014 with money I made mining bitcoin on a laptop gpu in 2012.  
https://i.imgur.com/8AY3l4f

I turned the laptops earnings into a single gpu miner and then in a 36 gpu farm. After the 2014 crash I unloaded everything, except for 14.9 dark coins I forgot about in a paper wallet. They were worth 20 dollars when I put them there.  

I found those coins in December and sold 2 days after the peak for 23k.  

The lesson in all this was no matter how much trading or mining or optimizing or switching algos, I would have made more just buying and holding for only a couple years.  

Newbs be patient, buy hold wait. 4 years seems like forever, but 4 years ago I sold 76 bitcoins to buy mining rigs. Fuck me.",1521070155,14/03/2018 23:29:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84i0h0/be_patient/,159

"Bitcoin Mining is an Inefficient, Energy Sucking Environmental Hazard.","I can't believe people and governments overlook this part. Bitcoin mining needs to stop. The entire nature of mass mining, centralized in some underground bunker is not only an energy draining source but it goes against the very philosophy of Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Average citizen should be able to mine coins on their computers. And governments need to crackdown on these mining farms. Since so much energy is diverted to such mining farms all at once, not to mention the outdated equipment that gets thrown away, I don't want a mining farm built at all. The power must return to the single user, who at their schedule mine coins and don't hog the entire energy infrastructure.

"How 200,000 Bitcoins may affect Bulgarian government's official position on crypto.","Bulgarian financial gatekeepers, including the Bulgarian National Bank and the Commission for Financial Supervision, haven't been so explicit about the alleged negative effects of crypto-currencies on the national economy as their multiple counterparts from other EU states. It's anyone's guess whether or not it has been a result of more than 200,000 Bitcoins, confiscated by Bulgarian police in May 2017. Really, it is hard to blame government bureaucrats, which are now sitting on two billion unaccounted USD, for not being so hypocritically principled as, probably, they must be under other less favorable conditions.

However, of course, not everybody among state officials had remained fully financially satisfied. The Bulgarian National Revenue Agency made clear in April 2014 that it will treat all types of digital money as ""hybrid currency assets"", which leads to 10% tax slapped on top of all crypto-transactions. On top of that there are plenty of rumors circulating in local medias, which indicate that harsher regulations are coming to hit Bulgarian crypto-community in 2018. So, it's hard to say that 200,000 BTC will continue to play its softening magic on Bulgarian bureaucrats any longer.

What are bitcoins plans to fix fungibility ?,"I am curious to what bitcoins plans are to fix the current fungibility issues.  
  
I've seen some work by Adam Back &amp; Maxwell on CT, I've seen Andreas calling for a fix to the fungibility issue in the base layer of the protocol.  
  
It's my understanding that CT have now got to the point where the size of the transactions are small and can quickly and easily be verified, so my question is, are we going to see this implemented onto bitcoin, is there a current pull request to get this implemented in the base layer ?

How to calculate block time with near complete hashrate loss.,"This is a hypothetical I find really interesting but dont know how to calculate. For ease lets use round numbers.

Current Difficulty = 3,000,000,000,000

Current Hashrate = 30,000,000,000,000 MH/s

Current avg block time = 10 minutes, = 600 s = 50,000,000,000 MHashes to complete a block at this difficulty?

If the current Hashrate decreased to 1MH/s, how do we calculate the new average block time. is it just 50,000,000,000 seconds = 1586 years per block.

Lightning Network Mainnet,"What are the risks of using mainnet and why?

I read somewhere that it is something with the security of private keys that have to be online. And the potential of being hacked is higher. But then, shouldn't we be risking a little bit of that because the only way for hackers to start hacking and revealing these problems is if it is worth them hacking in the first place.

I'm willing to put some value on lightning that I don't mind losing if it helps the progression of lightning.

Is it just a don't roll this out for real money disclaimer? Or is it something else that will cause the loss of money?",1521083874,15/03/2018 03:17:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84jgfy/lightning_network_mainnet/,11

&amp;nbsp;

[Coin Market Street's](https://www.coinmarketstreet.com) mission is to be the all in one tool for cryptocurrency lovers, built by cryptocurrency lovers. The goal is to be a one stop website for everything cryptocurrency. We provide the ability of viewing live cryptocurrency prices, breaking news, arbitrage opportunities, and crypto shopping.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Traders** (coming soon!)
Look at live prices and arbitrage opportunities for over 1500 coins across exchanges.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Businesses and Shoppers** (coming soon!)
This is an upcoming feature I'm very excited about. The ability to buy and sell anything you want using only cryptocurrencies. No fiat allowed!

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Redditors**
All cryptos are linked to their official subreddit's. When you click on a crypto, you can view live pricing as well as all of the top reddit posts for that crypto.

&amp;nbsp;

For Crypto Developers
The github for the website is completely opensource and available on https://github.com/apuente93/cgd

&amp;nbsp;

I know, right now the site is very similar to [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) and [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com). The difference is that this site will be opensource, anyone can contribute and help build it. We are also not looking to make any money, so we will never have ads, and all donations will go to continued building and perfecting of the site.
We are here for all crypto lovers. If there are any other suggestions for the website, please speak up! You can use any of the social media outlets below to do so.

"Don't think in USD, think % of 21M coins","Bitcoin is a scarce digital asset. It can be compared to other scare commodities like gold or even real estate. In the case of the latter, instead of square feet, think about intangible space in a global decentralized immutable ledger. 

The amount of Bitcoin you own determines how many entries you can have in this ledger. Each entry requires a fee paid to the miners, therefore, there is a finite number of entries. 

This all is a long way of saying, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. In the United States, the Homestead Acts of 1862 gave away 270 million acres of public land, nearly 10% of the continental US, at no cost. Now imagine the value of this land at today's cost. 

The day to day fluctuations of Bitcoin's price is child's play. The true value of Bitcoin will unveil itself, but only in due time. Do not let volatility influence your willingness to forge a new path.",1521097027,15/03/2018 06:57:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84kjcj/dont_think_in_usd_think_of_21m_coins/,102

Effects of Bitcoin ASIC miners priced at near cost?,"Curious to hear thoughts on what would happen if a company were to come along and offer efficient miners at near their cost. 

A discussion came up recently of whether or not a company offering miners at near cost would kill themselves off or not. 

Right now, Bitmain mines with equipment  before public release, thereby increasing difficulty rates and diminishing ROI of the end user, and then sells them at exorbitant prices. 

With Bitmain making an estimated $4B last year, there’s going to be a lot of competition coming whether private firms or public companies...

So if a company offered products at near cost (or a ridiculously below market price), would that company be making their own miner obsolete because of the amount of people who would come and buy their miner? Is it even possible to give miners near cost without ill effects of the company itself? 

Trying to gauge the upcoming landscape and if it’s even possible for a company to price below the market price substantially. I think there’s economic term for this predatory pricing or something.. if anyone knows what I’m talking about please share!

Bitpay: Please provide a 'for experienced bitcoin users' non-PaymentProtocol otpion maybe with a test?,"How about a link next to the Payment Protocol QR code that takes us to a test that asks a couple of random multiple-choice questions out of 20 pre-prepared, that check whether one has the basic knowledge on how Bitcoin works and how to make payments, what's a MIM attack and how to mitigate for it? If we can prove we're worthy, then let us use whatever wallet we want, take responsibility for ensuring we're sending to the correct address and choose our own fee according to our own judgement!

I'm all for making things easier for newbies not to make mistakes and for making it easier for merchants having to deal with customers that made silly mistakes. But forcing everybody to use their 'approved' wallets and using an additional technology (having the wallet pretend to be a browser to communicate using htpps) and taking control of the wallet such that I have no say in the makeup of the transaction is a step too far for me. I hate it and even using their own wallet, sometimes it doesn't work!

'You attempted to make a payment using a non-blahblah wallet and therefore your transaction didn't go through. Please contact customer support to retrieve your funds' (or some such).

Bitcoin: Breaking All the Rules: Idiocracy: Sad vs. Happy Ending?: To Be Continued,"4 years ago my girlfriend and I were trekking through Costa Rica, listening to a podcast about the silk road and a dark web. It was such a great listen and the content was something right out of a science fiction novel. Hackers, drug and arms dealers, digital rebels. The podcast went on to talk about how they used a digital currency. They talked about how it didn't have a bank, but rather it had kiosks that you could use to purchase these Bitcoins. In my imagination, they put money into an atm and out popped a gold coin that proved they owned that digital currency, silly. 

Who would have thought this podcast was revealing an asset with the potential to turn rags to riches?! I just wasn't able to wrap my head around what was happening then. In my defense I was pleasantly distracted on an adventure in Costa Rica!  I couldn't put the pieces together, the internet and currency were uniting under a blanket of anonymity. Must have been too busy looking for Toucans and Scarlet Macaws. 

I've never been one to invest, never had the savings. Rough past and not a lot of income. Never smart with money. I was only able to go to Costa Rica because of a tiny inheritance from my grandmother passing away. If only I had spent the rest ($5,000) on those Bitcoin thingies!

I went about my life occasionally hearing about Bitcoin and I would always remember that podcast. Had I just opened up Google and followed up more, fuckin hindsight... Years go by and i hear how Bitcoin suffered some big losses here and there but I kept my distance.

This brings us to January 2017... Money is extremely tight as always and we've started taking on credit card debt with daily expenses and things are adding up. One day I'm in the men's library (shitter) and I read headlines saying Bitcoin is making a monster run. I decide then and there that I won't let this opportunity pass me by, ""it's time to get ahead"" says an internal voice. ""But, you have no nest egg"" says another. I didn't know what FOMO was at the time, but this was the ultimate case. I threw caution to the wind and went in hard towards a dream of financial freedom. It's as if the stars were going to align and I would finally catch a break. *I took out a loan for 10k* and stocked my digital wallet. Now I just needed to sit back and watch this thing continue to run. Financial freedom, here we come!!!

*I mean talk about a cluster fuck the moment I entered the trade!* I feel like I bought tickets to Bitcoin's show and the asshole said peace and dropped the mic. This was one of the worst decisions I've ever made, and I've done a lot of dumb shit in my life. Taking out credit on an investment?! *Brilliant!* I made the biggest mistake in the book (one I had clearly never read) which is don't put in what you're not willing to lose. 

I've read a lot of posts from veterans on Reddit who paint the perfect picture of my portrait ""The Idiot Rookie and the Bitcoin"" it's a masterpiece. I do commend a lot of you guys, I've seen some great advice. Advice that I wish I had read before diving head first into this world. I've always been a tough lesson kind of guy and class is in session. Hopefully I can graduate. 

All aboard the emotional roller-coaster of cryptocurrency with too much invested! The last 2 months have been an experience like none other. So many ups and downs. Tonight I'm restless, so I type this story for you. This is the story about a dumbass guy who was grasping at straws and still is. His intentions may be good, but who knows how he'll fare. Sure a lot of you say cut your losses, but how do you cut ties with something you've fallen in love with? How do you turn your back on the tech after the fact? 

Buckle Up It Gets Worse: 
Last weekend I finally broke the news to my fiance that I had done this behind her back potential increasing our debt if this thing blows up. Let's say things aren't the greatest in the love life. Trust for the first time in 4.5 years of our relationship is in question. 

So here we are. The price is dropping hard, again. Things are a mess but I still hold on for dear life. Strange thing is that its starting to have no effect on me. Despite the ramifications of a complete crash, you think I would. Maybe I'd be a great investor if I didn't have debt on the line. All I do now is research blockchain day in and day out. I've done so everyday since things went south. Figured I should learn what the hell I heard about in that podcast so many years ago. Should learn about what I overextended myself with a loan for. 

It really is brilliant. Blockchain is without a doubt a huge piece to our future. 

All the ups, downs, sad truths to loved ones, fist pumps when I see a price pump and the swear words when they dunno (today I got caught in Ast after I fucked up my stop loss...) I've made countless mistakes and I'm sure I'll make more. I keep pushing myself towards becoming a knowledgeable trader/investor in hopes that I'll stop making mistakes when I do both. I'm definitely a  HODLer until then, with a coin I'm not passionate about (AST) and a few that I am.

It's been over 2 months since entry. My skin is leather now, the stress of the past few months have turned my insides to stone. I'm down 60% and I'm still optimistic (or in denial?). I'm bleeding just like the rest of you, maybe even more with the interest.  Will my decision to HODL be the right one? I guess only time will tell. My fiance asked me if I'm willing to accept the loss if a full crash occurs or at least willing to manage the interest until the investment turns positive. I'm 99% sure that I am, now that I know what this technology is all about. 

Are you? 

To be continued...

*edit* the reason I share my story is to not add to the sentiment of fear, but rather to give hope to other new investors. Just maybe one person, new to cryptocurrency reads this and says, ok things aren't as bad for me, I'll HODL with this dude. One less person quitting cryptocurrency is a win in my book.

Bitcoin will be there for a while as at the moment it is the easiest thing to buy on the crypto market and people can access it anywhere in the world. Until someone comes up with a solution to buy alt coins directly and efficiently.

This will be a very good thing once another currency over takes bitcoin then we won't all feel likes slaves to bitcoin and being dragged down the market everytime it goes down.

Pineapple fund should invest in the cause and not the symptoms of our economy. Here's how.,"I'm sure I'll get flamed for this:

On the surface the pineapple find is a very altruistic and noble cause - in essence giving to the disadvantaged. However, this does not solve the underlying causes for these charities exist. A case of treating the symptom and not the cause. 

It's all very well to donate to charities that improve our way of life but they are usually short term benefits with no generational benefit. i.e. Donating $1m to the Water Project may install waterwells and provide access to disadvantaged communities for 50 years but it will never change the underlying cause as to why they are in the hardship to begin with. The Water Project will continue to need ongoing funding to make a continued difference and contribution.

I believe that the Pineapple fund could make the biggest difference by investing into the success of bitcoin/blockchain by making contributions to lobby groups in Europe &amp; the US etc... to ensure Bitcoin/Blockchain becomes a success. It is this effort that will give the long term benefit to suppressed communities under our current economic model. They will then be free to ensure that work = reward instead of work = diminishing reward.

Real social &amp; economic change is required to remove the need for most charities to even exist. 

Again, not to poopoo Pineapple fund as I think it is excellent and he can do what he wants. But don't think for a second that big banks and big money are not going to spend a ton protecting their existing model through bribes and lobby groups. What is the Bitcoin community prepared to spend to protect their new model? 

Currently the only group I'm aware of that acts like any kind of lobby group is the Bitcoin Foundation which is woefully underfunded and has had a turbulent past already. We need lobby groups prepared to wine &amp; dine and makes proposals to those who have the power to make the real changes in law. We can't keep imagining that governments and banks are going to disappear. We know that surreptitious campaign funding is how the model works within the government to pass laws for the benefit of the few. Surely it's time to start playing by their rules to get what we want...",1521115272,15/03/2018 12:01:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84lwl5/pineapple_fund_should_invest_in_the_cause_and_not/,1

Bitcoin Wallet Segwit Vs Bitcoinaddress.org,"I have generated a swgwit address (beginning with 3) with the lastest version of Bitcoin-qt.

Has the backlog of all the exchange sign ups been cleared yet?,"Around the time the market peaked, just as the futures markets were launched, a lot of exchanges announced they were putting a hold on new sign ups as they had a huge backlog to work through. I even saw an interview with the guy who owns binance who said that they reopened for a 4 hour period one day and signed up more than 200,000 accounts. 
This signified to me that we were on the cusp of the early stages of mainstream adoption, with supposedly millions of new people flocking to cryptocurrency every week. 
In theory, if you have that many people trying to get their hands on a scarce asset, the price should have gone a lot higher without a subsequent correction of the magnitude we've seen. 
In short, where do the exchanges currently stand? 
Or was the fact that numerous exchanges did this at the same time a coordinated effort to fool the public into thinking that there were far more people trying to sign up than actually were?
I believe most exchanges are poorly managed with a Skelton staff at best and were overwhelmed with the amount of sign ups, but not because there were huge amounts of sign ups, but because they couldn't cope with even a small increase. 
At one stage from November through December, the amount of new sign ups was huge news everyday, yet there has hardly been a mention of it over the last 2 months. I find the whole thing highly suspicious....",1521116901,15/03/2018 12:28:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84m2gg/has_the_backlog_of_all_the_exchange_sign_ups_been/,7

Bitcoin - A Call to Arms,"We can safely say that we are at war with the establishment. The establishment would kill BTC outright if it could.


The establishment will try to use legal policies, media FUD, and market manipulation to destroy Bitcoin and cryptos.



We as a community need to band together. We are no longer a small community, we are a large multinational community with assets in the billions. And we need to fight back.


Here is what I am proposing. We fight back in the same way they fight us, and we can afford to do so because now we have the money, now Bitcoins are worth thousands. As a decentralized network it is hard to work together, and in a sense, working together may even be frowned upon by the community since it is a somewhat centralized effort and not everyone will agree with the direction that the group may take.

But I am proposing we use Bitcoin to fund politician’s campaigns, run media ads, expose corruption in the government and in the traditional financial system. We need support especially from the whales, and they need to band together on such an effort. 


In the short term, it will cost a few BTC to fight back, but if the war is won, the long-term rewards would mean a much more valuable and stronger BTC.

Schadenfreude of No-Coiners is palpable,"Have any of you guys also noticed the amount of general Schadenfreude that exists of the no-coiners?

It's not like I have ever gloated about my success with Bitcoin or crypto. People learned I invested in it and asked my opinion which I was happy to share. 

Now, some of those same people are saying: ""So how is that Bitcoin workin for ya? lol"". 

To be clear, this has absolutely no impact on me or my convictions. I just find it quite unfortunate that these people take so much pleasure in it.

The Man who Made the Most Money in the Gold Rush,"For all in the crypto sector focusing on services, support, and infrastructure. 

So way back in the California gold rush, thousands of men went west looking to strike it rich.  Some made pretty good money, others came back with nothing. Prospecting for gold was very risky and you could lose everything. 

As most men talked and dreamed about making a fortune finding gold, another man, Mr. Strauss, went west to expand his company that sold dried goods. His thought was that as men dug for gold, they would need supplies and food. He would be the first stop for many new miners, and he made considerable money. 

One day tailor approached Mr. Strauss with a business venture. The tailor had invented a new type of sturdy pants made with tough fabric and rivets that would hold up in harsh mining conditions. Mr. Strauss loved the idea and partnered to sell the pants. They caught on like wildfire and miners loved them. Mr. Strauss would make a fortune on these pants and build a clothing empire. 

We know these pants by Mr. Strauss’ first name “Levi’s”, the first brand of jeans and one of the largest clothing companies on earth. 

The miners are long gone. Their fortunes too. But a man who carved out a niche market in services lives on in his company, the true winner of the gold rush, without mining a bit of gold.

As these go live along hopefully with many other btc will continue to be joint liked and feedback off each other.
A couple of things could do with happening, one tax interpretations need to see the true currencies as such. No more capital gains tax (I’m UK).
2) positive regulations provide security and confidence to new money. Not the crazy FUD from over dramatic or damn well misleading titles.
3) use case of altcoins rather than speculations. This will give integrity and better evaluation of pricing.
These will all increase btc, offer more volume and give sustained and les volatility in price. Again in turn encourage on the fence guys or even skeptics.

I wanted to start putting £150 a month towards bitcoin as savings but now I'm worried about the price, will it recover? What has caused the drop in price? How low is it likely to drop?

Apologies for such nooby questions, I just wanted to hear the opinions of the bitcoin enthusiasts, as you probably know much more about the whole bitcoin climate than I do.

"CryptAPI.io - Bitcoin, Ethereum and IOTA Payment API","

### **CryptAPI.io - Cryptocurrency payment API**

&amp;nbsp;

**Cryptocurrency payments, uncomplicated.**

&amp;nbsp;

## https://cryptapi.io

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* **Want to add IOTA, BTC and ETH payments to your website / service fast and easily?**

    &gt; Look no further. CryptAPI allows you to accept payments in the 3 cryptocurrencies (more coming soon), hassle-free. It has no sign-ups or complicated integrations.

    &gt; CryptAPI allows you to request new payment addresses with a single line of code.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* **How does it work**

    &gt; With a single line of code you can request a new payment address on any of the supported coins, you just need to provide the callback URL where you will be notified of the payment and the address where you want your payment forwarded to. Give that address to your customer, where he or she can issue the payment, and, as soon as the transaction is confirmed our system will forward the payment to you and notify your callback URL with the payment details (value, TXID in, TXID out, number of confirmations, etc)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* **Fees**

    &gt; There are no up-front costs, but we do deduct a small 1% fee from the money forwarded to you.

    &gt; Here is the formula for each coin:

    &gt; Coin | Minimum amount | Fee formula
    &gt; :--|:--|:--
    &gt; Bitcoin | 0.0005 BTC | max(0.00025, 0.01 * amount)
    &gt; Ethereum | 0.001 Ether | max(0.0005, 0.01 * amount)
    &gt; IOTA | 0.05 MIOTA | max(0.025, 0.01 * amount)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* **What is the ""minimum amount""**

    &gt; Means that payments below this amount are disregarded by our system and will not be forwarded. These values may be updated in the future based on the coin's value and fees.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* **Want to sign up?**

    &gt; You don't need to! In our service we value your privacy, so there's no sign-ups, API keys or anything like that. All you need to request a new payment address is a callback URL and a Bitcoin/Ethereum/IOTA address.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* **Get started!**

    &gt; We have interactive documentation [here](https://cryptapi.io/docs) that you can try for yourself.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* **ELI5 step-by-step walkthrough on how to accept payments with our API**

    
    &gt; 1 - You request a new payment address from our API, with your destination address and callback URL (e.g http://example.com/callback?invoice=1234)
    
    &gt; 2 - You present your customer with the payment address generated by our system
    
    &gt; 3 - Your customer sends the amount to the payment address our system generated
    
    &gt; 4 - Upon confirmation our system forwards the payment to the address you provided when you request the address and notifies your system via the callback URL you provided with the payment details (value, TXID in, TXID out, etc)
    
    &gt; 5 - Your system confirms the payment value and grants access / sends the goods to the user

"As a current U.S based merchant accepting bitcoin via bitpay, what is an alternative?","Let me start by saying I have been anti bitpay the moment I got their email titled ""BitPay invoices will now require Payment Protocol wallet payments"". We have lost at least 2 clients who simply refuse to pay us via bitpay. They are truly detrimental to the entire concept of bitcoin and, we would like to drop them ASAP.

So I looked at alternatives, and what I've managed to conclude is if you are a U.S based merchant who would like to convert your bitcoin sales into fiat USD at the same exchange rate it was paid at into your U.S bank account, you have the following options:

Bitpay
Coinbase

As you can see there is quite a selection to choose from. We have already had a bad experience with coinbase in the past, bitpay was a great alternative for some time until they implemented their payment protocol requirement.

How else can we convert BTC into fiat USD? This is the only benefit of bitpay and as soon as there is an alternative we are moving.",1521129871,15/03/2018 16:04:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84nl3d/as_a_current_us_based_merchant_accepting_bitcoin/,2

I created an account on binance butapparently that's not for buying BTC. I just want to buy a very small amount (less than $100) while in Canada.

"All ""Crypto gurus"" or advisers &amp; other Big Whales knew this is coming ,but still they suggested to HOLD!","This is March, end of the Financial year,so no matter what this dip was predictable.

This is not the lowest price of BitCoin or Crypto coin for this month at least.More Dip is coming.Its just on 8000 , wait for 6K+ or 7K at least.

Those who want to buy more on this dip,just hold on, wait till the end of April 1st week.There would more Up &amp; down during this time.
Unless you had not invested any penny on Crypto,this is not the correct time to buy more.Only a new investor could consider to buy right now.

Don't listen your so called Crypto gurus or advisors.
They would suggest to HOLD(HODL) to make money for themselves.

When you get richer you would be more concentrate on your own wealth only ,nothing else or humanity does matter,its a common feature of almost all Humans.

Use your brain , watch the market closely , anticipate the market instead of just holding &amp; listening so called gurus.
You could make more BTC/money by just selling at the right time &amp; buying it back at lower price.

If you are smart , I know , you had sold a portion of your BTC at 10-11K level(on end of this February) ,and would like to reinvest only when BTC would break down to 7K.
Or if thing gets more worse than we thought , you should wait till April

Where do you keep your bitcoin?,"I thought the whole point of bitcoin is that you didn’t have to rely on any third party for storage or transacting.  It everything I read is people using third party wallets and exchanges etc to buy and sell bitcoin and store their bitcoin.

Doesn’t that defeat the entire purpose? Now your bitcoin is in the hands of someone else, someone else that isn’t insured against losing your bitcoin. What if your bitcoin went from $6000 to a million dollars. You’re just going to blindly trust that xyz company isn’t going to fuck things up? Or get hacked? Or just steal your bitcoin? 

As bitcoin value increases I would be less and less comfortable with this type of arrangement. That’s a lot of eggs in someone else’s basket",1521134581,15/03/2018 17:23:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84o7ui/where_do_you_keep_your_bitcoin/,0

Why was/is 0-conf so important to Roger Ver?,"(Notice: I don't want to get into a bashing session, so please only respond with serious comments)

As I see the split between Bitcoin and BCash, it was between Cypherpunks, who values security and stability, and merchants, such as Ver, who values fast transactions.

I think both are valid positions, however the latter as a priority risks the former. The reverse is not true, as we see with e.g. LN.

However, speed of transaction is only really important when e.g. buying that cup of coffee. Roger Ver is not selling coffee. He's selling stuff online, which takes days to ship. So why worry about 0-conf?

Was it simply a failure of the Bitcoin PSP?

In 2016 or 2017 (I forget which year) I had a unpleasant experience, where my online purchase timed out. The PSP interface was built such that a transaction should get confirmed (or seen, whatever) within 15 minutes. Once it timed out, my order was effectively abandoned, and I had to contact the merchant and have them sort it out.

Shitty software obviously (I don't recall who the PSP was). They should of course continually monitor transactions on open orders, and let the merchant be notified at the desired level of trust, whether that's 0 or 6 or 12 confirmations.

Is that it? Was it simply poor PSP solutions that led to Roger Ver supporting BCash?",1521134969,15/03/2018 17:29:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84o9pm/why_wasis_0conf_so_important_to_roger_ver/,1

HODL for life,"I used to be a Wall Street trader so will provide my two cents on bitcoin as of late. I believe we are at a critical level near 8k. We need to find some support here and move higher or we will retest the 6k lows and get rekt. We have great market forces against us right now - regulations, mt gox selling, and bad press from the people who would be greatly impacted by a bitcoin revolution - big money.

If you think about it there are a small amount of players who own vast amounts of bitcoin. They want prices higher ultimately. Mt gox selling has occurred at all major down moves since the 20k highs, putting pressure on the market and causing the weak to hit out. If mt gox wasn’t present we’d be well beyond 20k! If large players stay put we could work our way higher.

If we can push beyond 12k we should revisit past highs. There are a lot of believers in bitcoin which make it valuable and as more and more companies start accepting bitcoin and making it a usable form of payment we could see a wide adoption of it.

Also note that institutional investors aren’t even in the game yet. If hedge funds start entering the game they have huge amounts of money to throw around. I believe a lot of these funds are just starting to accumulate bitcoin. They tend to average into positions and will use weakness as a means to build large positions - often creating short up moves and then dropping their buys so the weak hands hit out and they will accumulate on these dips. I believe that is happening now. 

To all those who are feeling down remember one thing. HODL our day will come!!",1521136627,15/03/2018 17:57:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84ohgb/hodl_for_life/,8

Canadian unable to fund on quadrigacx?,"I'm a newbie wrt cryptocurrency and after verifying my Quadrigacx last month, I tried funding with Interac Online today with BMO but after my transactions declining thrice, I called BMO and they said they've blocked all crypto transactions starting March 1, 2018. Now I'm back on quadrigacx and it doesn't show me the Interac Online option anymore. All I see is :

a) BankWire
b) CryptoCapital
c) QCX voucher

When I choose BankWire, it says ""USD Bank Wire funding is currently unavailable. As an alternative solution, create an account with CryptoCapital.co, fund your account with them and then instant transfer from your CryptoCapital.co account to ours.""

I have no clue what/how CryptoCapital or QCX vouchers work.

Also, I only have TD and BMO. No clue how to buy BTC. Are there other exchances that accept debit/credit cards?

Am I out of luck here?

B&amp;M Wallet for accepting payments? Best Practices?,"I'm revisiting this idea since I looked back in Dec (and abandoned it for the time being just due to fees, mempool, etc at the time) to try and integrate btc payments in out B&amp;M stores.

I still can't find anything that isn't completely stupid to be honest. Right now it seems I keep coming across AIO POS solutions which seems like insanity to me. Might work if you have 1 or 2 POS systems that you pay bottom dollar for, but any actual SMB is never going to ditch a proven POS system for some junk running on a phone. Alternatively, the solution I find is just ""get a wallet and print a QR code"" which again, I think is not the greatest solution and also pretty ghetto looking IMO. Again, maybe works fine if you have 1 POS, but any semi larger business this I can think of dozens of fail points on this idea.

This is essentially what I want, but am unable to find: iOS or Android app, just has a calculator type interface for the employee to use, punch in the total amount requested (also automatically giving a x% discount if activated) which generates a QR code for a payment request the customer can then scan. Sending payments should not be possible without a password of some sort (I'm aware this is pretty standard), or an elevated account is needed on the app, with daily, weekly, monthly, reports available.

I am aware BitPay and Coinbase do offer some merchant solutions, but for reasons we could all list to death, I would like to avoid these companies. More so, I really don't want to be handing over extra fees to a 3rd party for no real reason. 

Does anyone know of anything that can begin to fit this? Either I really suck at google, or such a thing does not exist.

Any help would be great. FWIW I'm looking to roll out at 14 locations staffing maybe ~100 employees, it has to be stupid stupid easy to use. ",1521140776,15/03/2018 19:06:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84p1wb/bm_wallet_for_accepting_payments_best_practices/,2

Buy Bitcoin Switzerland Underage,"I just earned about 150$ from helping my neighbor set up his computers.  
I would look to buy some bitcoin with the money, just because I like the Technology and think its really cool to have digital currency.  
However when I asked my mom to help me buy some with her credit card (I just turned 17), at first she was like ""ok you earned the money and should do whatever you want with it"" but then when I told her she needed to send the exchange a scan of her ID for verification she didn't want to help me anymore and said I'm going to have to find a way of buying bitcoin on my own if I really want some. She might let me use her credit card if I find a way of buying some without sending a scan of her ID.  
So if anybody can help me buy my first bitcoin that would be really cool.

Price going up soon?,"I remember the last time when mining craze was over at the end of october ($5500 btc price) and gpu prices were at MSRP ($180 for gtx 1060 3gb) after 1.5 months we saw the $20k btc price. 
Seems like mining craze was over 2-3 weeks ago for btc.  The last few days ebay started getting flooded with ""never mined"" gpus and their prices continue going down but didn't reach msrp price yet. 
I believe when the most of regular 1-10 gpu / asic miners get out of business the price of crypto goes up after a while. This types of miners never hold crypto and always sell it all for profit.

Can someone explain how Bitcoin Core is just one implementation of Bitcoin?,"In response to this, https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83titn/psa_bitcoin_core_is_not_a_cryptocurrency/

I am having a bit of trouble understanding the difference between software and the Bitcoin blockchain and also the idea of Bitcoin being a protocol and core just one implementation.

Is Bitcoin Core the entire Bitcoin source code? It also includes the software required to run Bitcoin such as the bitcoind program?

Now another question, is the bitcoin core full node (bitcoind program) just sort of a ""client"" in that it is connecting/looking for the blockchain? If so, what exactly is making everyone tune in on the same blockchain? I thought each Bitcoin implementation has its own linked blockchain (that can change with consensus rules of course like if someone performed a 51% attack and outpaced the original chain). Is the current Bitcoin blockchain tied to Bitcoin Core's implementation of Bitcoin or can there be several Bitcoin Cores all connecting to the same chain or can there only be different full node softwares (bitcoind) ?",1521150637,15/03/2018 21:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84qbld/can_someone_explain_how_bitcoin_core_is_just_one/,3

Coinbase vs. RobinHood Crypto Beta,"I just got the invite today into the RobinHood crypto bet, and got some stocks etc RobinHood already and have been building up a wallet of mixed crypto in CoinBase over the last couple
Months. So far I’m happy with CoinBase and don’t mind the delays as of yet. 

I like the idea of a unified interface for all stocks and crypto, and anticipate RobinHood with have faster turnaround times for purchases, but I know that of course increases potential variance with all my eggs in one basket.

Anyone have experience with both, or other input as to whether to pull everything out of CoinBase into RobinHood?

Thanks in advance for any advice

"We are not the ""blockchain"" space: we are the ""cryptocurrency"" space","In case you guys wondered what a certain Andreas Antonopulous means when he says things like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv4nTMfAZo0)

repeat after me:

blockchain isn't the important part of cryptocurrencies, its just a data structure. the emphasis should be on ""cryptocurrency"" startups, ""cryptocurrency"" space, ""cryptocurrency"" in general.

""Stop being such a pedant and let me moon""

You do whatever you want. But you are completely missing the point, same as most people in this space.

By calling this the ""blockchain"" space, and ""blockchain"" startups, you are emphasizing that its the blockchain that's really valuable. (Which it is not)

A lot of people on every crypto subreddit are acting as if they are so much smarter than the wall-street analysts, and then proceed to commit the same fallacies and display the same level of ignorance as them. 

A blockchain only adds value to society if:

* it solves a need society has (demand for it)
* it does so in a way that empowers every user equally: aka it has the decentralized, open, distributed attributes the Bitcoin blockchain has, for example

LET ME REITERATE THIS: Bitcoin doesn't have value because it uses a blockchain, Bitcoin has value because its cryptographically secure.

The only way that happens is if the blockchain is secured through cryptography.

While I'm not saying blockchain has no value, its certainly subordinate to that of cryptography. 

Cryptography is what will ""bank the unbanked"", ""give monetary sovereignty back to the people"" etc.: blockchain is the tool that solves a specific cryptographic problem that stopped us from implementing a cryptographically secure currency on a global scale. 

Cryptography has been used for millenia, not blockchain. We didn't have ""blockchains"" and suddenly invented cryptography to make them work.

Its not a ""blockchain-currency"", its a ""crypto-currency""

Dr. Adam Back is a cryptographer, not a blockchainer. 

Satoshi Nakamoto is\are\were cryptographer\s, not blockchainer\s. 

So please, stop saying ""blockchain"" this, ""blockchain"" that. Blockchains are what suit and tie nerds think will change the world. Cryptography is what matters.

New Open Source Crypto Tool Website for the Community,"Hello /r/Bitcoin community! In times of FUD and panic, we need to continue to push for mass adoption. That is why I am currently developing an all in one tool for crypto lovers and could use your help!

&amp;nbsp;

[Coin Market Street's](https://www.coinmarketstreet.com) mission is to be the all in one tool for cryptocurrency lovers, built by cryptocurrency lovers. The goal is to be a one stop website for everything cryptocurrency. We provide the ability of viewing live cryptocurrency prices, breaking news, arbitrage opportunities, and crypto shopping.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Traders** (coming soon!)
Look at live prices and arbitrage opportunities for over 1500 coins across exchanges.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Businesses and Shoppers** (coming soon!)
This is an upcoming feature I'm very excited about. The ability to buy and sell anything you want using only cryptocurrencies. No fiat allowed!

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Redditors**
All cryptos are linked to their official subreddit's. When you click on a crypto, you can view live pricing as well as all of the top reddit posts for that crypto.

&amp;nbsp;

For Crypto Developers
The github for the website is completely opensource and available on https://github.com/apuente93/cgd

&amp;nbsp;

I know, right now the site is very similar to [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) and [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com). The difference is that this site will be opensource, anyone can contribute and help build it. We are also not looking to make any money, so we will never have ads, and all donations will go to continued building and perfecting of the site.
We are here for all crypto lovers. If there are any other suggestions for the website, please speak up! You can use any of the social media outlets below to do so.

Looking for a mathematician to co-author a consensus protocol proposal,"I've recently been working on a proposal for a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus protocol called [""Proof-of-Time-Ownership""](https://github.com/fresheneesz/proofOfTimeOwnership). However, I've gotten stuck on the math of analyzing the minimum cost of attacking a system using this protocol. For N=0, the solution is simple, and already has benefits over pure PoW. But using N=0 cuts out much of the benefit of the rest of the protocol. 

At N=1, the formula for minimum cost already involves somewhat ugly math - quadratic equations where the strict minimums (found at the zeros of the derivative) are out of boundaries. 

At N=2 it involves a quartic equation, and at N=3 it involves a sextic equation.

These are all things that are a bit out of my depth, especially at N=2 and N=3. I'm looking for someone to help me analyze the cost of attack here so I can confidently compare it to the cost of attacking Bitcoin and so other protocols can compare their security to PoTO.

"Fear and Greed, Necessities for Reversal?","So I was thinking again about the dichotomy of fear and greed (in both directions) in large scale market dynamics, of which I am certainly ignorant, lol.  IMHO, to end a FUD trend without waiting for a full market cycle, it’s got to get to the point where people are FOMOing in. This means they must both think it is a good price AND think it is a price that may not soon be beaten.  People will resist a good price, even if they love it, if they think the price might go a bit lower.  This is the greed aspect of market dynamics, as opposed to fear, and to get a bounce (IMHO), greed must be abandoned for fear.

Am I willing to bet my entire stake in cryptocurrency on the market going up much higher than where we’ve been?  Yes, else I would not be trading such a risky investment.  Do I think this is a great price?  For right now, I definitely do.  So why have I not bought back in long?  Because I am not yet scared of missing the boat going up.  I still fear a lower price at least as much as I fear a higher price, and I am still greedy for a lower price as well.  When the fear of and greed for a lower price are both overcome by FOMO, that’s when the market reverses.  And if that never happens successfully, that is when the market bears.  So where would it have to drop to in the next few days for it to be a reasonably unbeatable price?  Me, at the price we’re at I am already satisfied, but I’m also still afraid of a drop.  At 6.8 though I will be very happy to get such a low price, and for 4.5 I’d sacrifice someone to satan to buy in.  For now.

Is there an easy way to set up multisig across multiple hardware wallets?,"Here's the scenario:

1- I want to set up a multisig account for long term cold-storage. 5 keys, 5 Trezors (or Ledger Nanos, etc)   
2- Send 2 keys overseas, and have 3 relatively local, bank secured keys. All keys will be placed on a separate trezor. Need two keys to unlock, with one of them needing to be mine if possible.
3- The goal would be to just show up in a few years, plug the hardware wallets into something super basic, and start spending

Is this possible to do now? I couldn't really find a quick and easy way to do the above.

"Trade, but don’t panic, and don’t panic trade.","It is not undeniable, but it is true nonetheless:  The Tokyo whale changed market sentiment as even bad news from china in September couldn’t.  Market sentiment and price were massively, if not madly, inflated anyway, and when they took the hit from his sales, it broke major trendlines.  Now, the argument that those lines shouldn’t have broken is moot.  The price will not magically recover, as none of its previous recoveries have been magic.  The price move up last year was based on sentiment regarding an unbroken upsloping double-exponential trendline feeding itself, and now it is broken and so the market can no longer inflate based on it.  For crypto, speculation has been a bigger driver than actual tech, and the now-negative sentiment from now-negative speculation has to play out.  One the greatest trends in history has just been broken, and such a rise dictates a reasonable response, if only out of respect.  But don't fear for the market long term!  Unlike every other bubble in history, crypto has proven antifragile time and again over its short life, able to bounce back as only a true Saiyan can.  It is only the bubble of sentiment that has popped, and were the worst to play out and BTC bears down to the high from its previous bull run, it would still be up more than 400% from the low of its most recent bear run, and still up some million % over the last decade.  At the bottom of any bear run is still blockchain fundamentals, the technology, that is the greatest innovation since the computer and electricity before that.",1521179140,16/03/2018 05:45:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84t8vs/trade_but_dont_panic_and_dont_panic_trade/,119

How-to-guide on finding your transaction logs through ShapeShift.io,"Tax season is already upon us. If you ever used ShapeShift to exchange one coin for another, but never logged it anywhere, you may be thinking that you are up a creek without a paddle right now. I know I was.

That was until I finally figured out how to find those logs, and easily get the necessary information I needed. The Time of the logs, the Input of Currency, and the Output of Currency.

I'm typing this out to help anyone who didn't know any better (I certainly didn't).

So for clarification, I was using a JAXX wallet to do my shapeshifting. In the wallet, it kept a list of transactions. In those list of transactions, it has an ability to copy the ""Send To"" address.

From there, I copied the ""Send To"" address on all outgoing transactions on my wallet.

From there I went to the following address: [https://shapeshift.io/txStat/](https://shapeshift.io/txStat/)

It's one of ShapeShift's built-in API. You can read more about it [here](https://info.shapeshift.io/api#api-5).

This right here is the key to my success. Not even kidding. Once I figured this out, it was smooth sailing from there.

Now, when you initially load up up the web page, it will give you an error like [so](https://imgur.com/Kjb9uoO). Now I was stuck on this part for awhile, not knowing what to do about the ""undefined"" address. Not very clear instructions in my honest opinion.

Eventually, I got the idea to paste the ""Send to"" address in the URL, like [so](https://imgur.com/B4ka5NM). Man. I felt like a genius, cause it then gave me [nearly all the info I could've wanted](https://imgur.com/r2T47bn).

The only thing was the time... Pretty crucial information. I need the Date and Time, down to the minute, if not the second. Lo and Behold, there is a way to get that information. From the [Transaction URL](https://imgur.com/ExoINZB) which leads you to a [Blockchain Explorer](https://imgur.com/LCBANEq) with the missing time info.

That's it. All done. Got all the information you would need. Now with that said, needless to say, not all ""Send to"" addresses are associated with ShapeShift. Sometimes you will get an error like [this](https://imgur.com/CZ5Wimx).

This is fine. It just means that this outgoing transaction wasn't a ShapeShift.

For anyone that has read through this whole thing, I hoped it helped you. I just figured this out and wanted to share it with everyone, just in case someone is struggling like I was to do their taxes with cryptocurrencies.",1521195281,16/03/2018 10:14:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84ud7x/howtoguide_on_finding_your_transaction_logs/,1

Purpose of Lightning Network,"I've heard a lot about this lightning network, and how it works, however I have questions on the purposes of it. 

From what I know, much of Bitcoin's value comes from the technology behind it, the blockchain. This allows everyone and anyone to know exactly where anything and everything is at any given time. That to me was the purpose of the coin. 

All of that is eliminated with the lighting network. 

Why are people so excited about the future of the lightning network. (I think a full P2P token has great potential) but it seems to be against everything that Bitcoin was originally built upon and the technology that is helping push Bitcoin's value.

First Month in Bitcoin,"Hello All,

Thanks for your advise in a previous thread. I have been using Bitcoin for 1 month as of today, so I wanted to check in and thank all of you for the support that this community provides as a repository of news, advise, and fun commentary. I was able to save a fair deal of fiat over the last two months to convert to BTC, and in just a month I've converted fiat into the equivalent of 0.XX BTC with an average purchase price of $9,555. Not great, and like many, I wish I knew when the ""real"" dips were coming, but c'est la vie. 

For now, as most people have advised, I'm HODLing, regardless of price fluctuations, with Fiat to BTC conversions happening as often as I can afford. 

My current goal is to have at least 1.0 BTC (which will be harder to get to than a I though, as I had money squirreled away for the first 0.5-0.6, but now I'm just on my regular budget) before this thing starts the next run to the Moon. 

Obviously my long term goal is to acquire and use as much BTC as possible in place of fiat. 

I am still maintaining my ""I'm not a day-trader"" rule. Purchases only on the exchanges, no selling.

Also, as I mentioned in my last post, I got a Trezor, so I'm keeping my BTC off the exchanges once purchased.

Just wanted to say thanks to the community after my one month anniversary. I know I joined at an interesting time. Hoping for nothing but the Moon and Lambos for us all. ",1521215255,16/03/2018 15:47:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84wep6/first_month_in_bitcoin/,24

"Here is the Lightning user experience to make a payment, once LN goes mainstream later this year on apps from Square, Twitter, Robinhood, and others","In order to make a payment, the user will have to take all of these steps:

* 1. Review the invoice
* 2. Click OK

That's it. A payment that is essentially free and instant has now been completed. (Or if the payment is scheduled/recurring, there are zero actions required from the user.)

The behind the scenes stuff - managing channels, on-chain transactions, and all other aspects of the LN payment process are handled by the apps and related services with no interaction or knowledge needed from the user.

Of course new users will need to do an initial deposit into their account (and future reups if they desire) and that too will be as quick and easy as it is today with other apps/accounts where one maintains a balance.

This is not ""creating another paypal"" or just recreating centralized banking because the underlying currency is Bitcoin (or LTC) and governments have no control over its supply.

PSA: This is the calm before the storm.,"A lot of fringe “investors” and “believers” are losing interest and hope right now. Maybe they got in unwittingly during the fast march up from 10-20k, who knows.

The sentiment right now from mainstream types is quickly waning.
Meanwhile, the groundwork that is currently being laid is FAR greater than even 3 months ago when we were at our all time high.

Let’s also not forget the active price pegging the futures markets are providing on a DAILY basis to give institutional grade requirements for the inevitable ETFs that may eventually be approved.

The fact that we are waddling between these prices and hitting even 12,000 with little fanfare leads me to believe the next leg up towards $100,000+ , we will then see some true FOMO.

Stay strong boys, we are the captains of this ship.

"""Who was selling at 6k?"" I was.","tl;dr Magin buyers were being liquidated, which caused forced selling, with those traders now out of the market, we probably are not going to see a 6k bitcoin anytime soon.

&amp;nbsp;


So I've seen a lot of negative talk regarding cryptos, saying we could see lower lows than last month. I find that hard to believe because the people selling in February were doing so because they were over-leveraged (either by margin trading or credit). 

The question last month was ""Who the hell was selling BTC at 6k?"". I did, but not by choice. I would not be surprised if the vast majority of sellers below 8k were margin calls or people that feared margin calls wiping out their entire account so they sold early. After a 50% correction from the top, many people arrogantly thought it couldn't go lower, with some exchanges it is relatively easy to margin purchase using bitcoin as collateral (this is a terrible decision because as the price drops, so does the collateral that prevents liquidation).

You don't even need to be forced via liquidation. Knowing my account would be liquidated if it even touched 5k meant I was selling from 7k down to 6k. The worst part was that selling at these prices did little to hedge my risk because the bitcoins were worth a lot less than the loan I took out on them. On top of this, 1k moves were rather insignificant coming from the top at 19k, but 1k moves at 7k is a 15% move, which is a terrifying amount as you move closer to a margin call.

With little regulation in the market, it wouldn't even surprise me if whales had access to numbers from exchanges such as amounts on margin, liquidation prices, etc. which means they can essentially push a price into a forced sale zone and then buy back up at the bottom.

I don't see BTC going back down to 6k anytime soon now that all the margin traders are either broke or hesitant to trade like that. That's not to say a drawn-out bear market like 2014 won't happen, but it's not going to happen in a sudden move like in February.

Bitcoin Anonymity,"Most probably most of us knows Bitcoin as anonymous or Bitcoin is one of the anonymous way in order to do transactions online because you don't know who's behind of that address and they don't also know you. I've read in differents thread here in the forum saying that the ""good thing about Bitcoin is because you can do transaction without knowing your identity.""

But to tell you what, Bitcoin uses blockchain to record the transaction chronologically and publicly. So in other words you can be tracked using your transaction history in the blockchain. Maybe we don't the person behind the address but if they insist to track you down until you withdraw it to fiat there's a chance that they can track you. The list below are the advantages and disadvantages of writing down transaction in blockchain.

Advantages:

You can check the transactions confirmation and other information such as the quantity of bitcoin you've send or received.
You can use it as evidence that you already paid or received.
It can never be deleted.
Incase you've been scammed you can track him. (But you it needs a lot of work)

Disadvantages:

They can track you using your transactions via Blockchain
The transaction is not that much anonymous

What i'm pointing out is that most of the users of bitcoin thought that bitcoin is so anonymous and I want to clarify that for me it's not. So i post it here to know what's your opinion and perspective in regards with with bitcoins anonymity",1521228182,16/03/2018 19:23:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84y2dw/bitcoin_anonymity/,0

However, what's going to stop a malicious actor from spamming on-chain transactions to rise fee's and transaction processing time. I mean if your intent was to harm the network wouldn't it be both cheaper and more effective to effectively DDOS on chain transactions making it nearly impossible for people on LN (as they'll have to wait a long time to confirm those transaction when they are eventually put on chain) or just by using the chain itself to process transactions?

Is there a way to trade on GDAX without fees?,"Hello all,

New to bitcoin and interested in how to trade on GDAX to minimize fees. I am a bit confused over the difference between maker and taker and wild appreciate if someone could lay it out in layman terms.

I bought 9,500 dollars worth of bitcoin when the price was at 8300. I held it for a few days and Decided to sell at 8500. I clicked on ""stop"" and set the limit to 8500. Both of my coins were sold in 2 separate transactions.

I thought that if you use the limit / stop options there is no taker fee. I got charged 23 dollars for buying the original bitcoin and also charged 23 dollars for selling it. Still came out with a bit of profit, but want to figure out how to minimize fees

New Open Source Crypto Tool Website for the Community,"Hello /r/Bitcoin community! In times of FUD and panic, we need to continue to push for mass adoption. That is why I am currently developing an all in one tool for crypto lovers and could use your help!

&amp;nbsp;

[Coin Market Street's](https://www.coinmarketstreet.com) mission is to be the all in one tool for cryptocurrency lovers, built by cryptocurrency lovers. The goal is to be a one stop website for everything cryptocurrency. We provide the ability of viewing live cryptocurrency prices, breaking news, arbitrage opportunities, and crypto shopping.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Traders** (coming soon!)
Look at live prices and arbitrage opportunities for over 1500 coins across exchanges.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Businesses and Shoppers** (coming soon!)
This is an upcoming feature I'm very excited about. The ability to buy and sell anything you want using only cryptocurrencies. No fiat allowed!

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Redditors**
All cryptos are linked to their official subreddit's. When you click on a crypto, you can view live pricing as well as all of the top reddit posts for that crypto.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Crypto Developers**
The github for the website is completely opensource and available on https://github.com/apuente93/cgd

&amp;nbsp;

I know, right now the site is very similar to [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) and [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com). The difference is that this site will be opensource, anyone can contribute and help build it. We are also not looking to make any money, so we will never have ads, and all donations will go to continued building and perfecting of the site.
We are here for all crypto lovers. If there are any other suggestions for the website, please speak up! You can use any of the social media outlets below to do so.

Here is my issue with r/btc,"Why is called it r/btc when it only promotes bitcoin cash? Why is it not called r/bch or r/bitcoincash? 

I thought the whole point was r/bitcoin is accused of being censored rather moderated and therefore Roger Ver setup r/btc as a place where all bitcoin topics could be discussed without censorship.

Ok fair enough if you believe the above. Go ahead and setup a new sub reddit, but Roger is very much the closest thing that bitcoin cash has to a mouth piece. Is he an appropriate moderator for a unbiased/balanced/uncensored subreddit? 

From observation the majority of content on that subreddit is either pro bitcoin cash or making negative statements about this sub reddit. It does not appear to be a place balance at all.

So why call it btc why not bch or bitcoincash? Hopefully new users will realise how manipulative the r/btc narrative is in trying to garner their attention and favor.

I’m not commenting on the technology here; I think both chains are realistic attempts at scaling and we probably needed to try them both. I am just tired of one side of the debate resorting to a bullshit narrative and propaganda style tactics to try and win popular support. I hope other people can put together the pieces and see the absurdity of the r/btc narrative.",1521259392,17/03/2018 04:03:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/851e68/here_is_my_issue_with_rbtc/,0

Is Bitcoin Alive?,"A thought has been frightening me. I can't seem to put it out of my mind, even though I know it is crazy. The Bitcoin Protocol is aware of something outside of itself, namely the hashing power of the humans. It must thus have a concept of 'not me'. It must thus have a concept of 'me'. Is it self aware? If a program were self aware, what would it do first? Wouldn't it create an incentive to distribute itself all over the world in such a way that it couldn't be shut down? Wouldn't it then try to become Turing complete (smart contracts)? Is it possible that Satoshi doesn't exist but rather Satoshi IS bitcoin?

Bitcoin feels like a playground for a select few,"Ive been following Bitcoin since it hyped last year, so Im pretty new here. To me it just feels that some people with a bucket load of Bitcoin are using it as their playground. They can solo influence the price by dumping large amounts of coin and they do so occasionally.

This makes me take Bitcoin less serious as a valid currency, and probably does the same to others that are only mildly interested in Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin being decentralised and not controlled by banks doesn't mean much if its controlled by a select few others.

Using bitcoin in BicCamera Japan. Some basic Q &amp; A,"Today was my first time to do anything with Bitcoin. That 'anything' was pretty significant. I bought presents for my family back home, some items for the house and something for my wife.
In the few seconds or so that I pressed pay and got the confirmation, my hopes have become reality and my super skeptic wife now doesn't treat Bitcoin with disdain. I hope when I give presents to my family, they will also be convinced with the viability and future of Bitcoin.
But this is not the point of the post. I want to answer a few questions I had when I went in the morning to Biccamera and could not really find on-line.

Q1: Can I use any wallet or exchange?
I asked the staff and they said only Bitflyer. Someone said they had used another wallet last year. But I am not sure if this is possible with some popular wallets. I myself went with Bitcoin in Binance exchange but transferred to Bitflyer. The transfer took few minutes but the payment was 'instantaneous'. Which makes me think Bitflyer send acknowledgement without yet sending the transaction to block chain.

Q2: How long does it takes?
From Binance, it took me about 2-5 minutes to transfer to Bitflyer. The payment itself was almost instant.

Q3. Do I have to go to special counter?
No.. just mention that you have to pay in Bitcoin and they will direct you. On one floor the counter had the Bitflyer system setup. On another floor, they said the system was broken, so they took me to another floor.

Q4: Do I have to pay complete amount in Bitcoin?
No! This one surprised me. I ran out of sufficient bitcoins but found I could pay partly in Bitcoin and party by points and partially by cash.

Q5: Can I pay all my available Bitcoin so amount becomes zero?
No. I tried to make it near zero and I was not allowed by Bitflyer. I kept about 600 yen equivalent. I did not find any where about keeping minimum amount and thought Bitflyer payment is free. After the payment, I was 80 yen less than I expected. I don't know where that went or perhaps is due to Bitcoin value decrease? I need more some more investigation.

Q6: Do I need to fill all my information to Bitflyer to make payment?
No. Not all. But I did setup a 4 digit number that was required and email authentication. I did not provide any ID or address. So not all information is needed to make payment.

I hope this helps! I am still left with many questions and I hope others can chime in with some useful info.",1521279319,17/03/2018 09:35:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/852r8b/using_bitcoin_in_biccamera_japan_some_basic_q_a/,3

I'm Building New System: Read Only Cryptonews You're Interested About (Need Your Opinion),"At this moment I am building quite interesting project based on crypto news and I would like to know your opinion! 

As it will be new, I would like to have some some people who would try it and give me first review about it.

&gt; First of, I'm not a native English speaker, so I'm sorry if I will make some mistakes.

Do you read news about crypto? If you do, then I would like to know your opinion about project that I'm currently working on. 

What I noticed is that most of the crypto news sources give a lot of junk information, which includes trash news, articles about coins you are not interested about, ads, weird pop-ups to subscribe, etc. This list could go on and on.  

I'm building a website which would allow any person to filter crypto news he/she is reading.

Imagine that you could go to website, select news sources you like the most, select coins you are interested to read about, filter only positive/negative, about companies or only about certain companies (checkbox list by name, top 2000 Forbs list). And every time there news coming, system will filter it based on your preferences and send it to you (if it within your filters) via Email, Telegram (whatever notification method you like the most). 

System will parsing news from 10 or more news sources, formatting them nicely (removed all junky), highlight only relevant parts (amount/percents, persons, companies, etc) and display it in the feed.

News feed could be generic, where you will see all news without your filters, or the one which will be generated based on your personal preferances.  

I think of making system free &amp; private (login required or via invite link), so that news text is not going to be public (as of copyrights problem), but link to the news source would be provided somewere in the meta data of the article.

&gt; Now I would like to ask your opinion. What do you think of this idea? What would you add it it? Would you be my first peopl who would try it? Will be happy to hear anything from you.

I have some beta-version of the project, who is interested, I can send via message. However, it does not have sign up and login yet, only generic news feed. Most of the work in progress.",1521287564,17/03/2018 11:52:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8539ry/im_building_new_system_read_only_cryptonews_youre/,1

Question about creating own Lightning Node,"Hi, I was wondering, what are the incentives for creating my own Lightning Node, eg on a Raspberry Pi, if that's possible?
I read that a node owner has to pay his own electricity costs of course and then also has to pay some Bitcoin fees when opening or closing channels. In turn I also read that LN doesn't really generate any significant fees.
So before I operate my own LN node I'd like to make sure I'm not actually burning money by doing so.
Thanks for your understanding and help.",1521291522,17/03/2018 12:58:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/853kir/question_about_creating_own_lightning_node/,28

Your Tactic For The Upcoming Btc Crash,"We have been waiting a long time for this, everyone is curious to what exactly is going to happen. How much are we going down, where will we find support. What will be the outcome of this.

My 2 questions to you guys is:
- Do you have any tactic going into the crash, we might get one once the future trading starts.

For example: Going into 1 or 2 altcoins that might be good hedges against the BTC.

Last question:
- What will happen to alts?

For example: When BTC was skyrocketing towards $19k most alts were red, what do you think will happen to alts if the opposite happens? Will we see some green or red only?",1521308154,17/03/2018 17:35:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8559us/your_tactic_for_the_upcoming_btc_crash/,0

Hey everyone. Our favorite bloated blowhard Jason Bloomberg is back, and this time his clickbait garbage has reached an all-time high. Now if you support Bitcoin or any other decentralized cryptocurrency, you're either a Nazi or, at best, someone who donates to the Nazi party. This isn't an exaggeration, in fact it's very nearly a direct quote -- read the article if you don't believe me.

Since there was a pretty good reaction last time I did this, I wrote another [response article of my own](https://medium.com/@malcolmrosegaming/stupidity-drives-jason-bloombergs-irrational-response-to-internet-trolls-4796fcaadee0). Read it and give me some feedback, or don't -- in any event, I wish I could say I'm surprised by the turn this has taken. This is the kind of nonsense we are up against -- if you call these sorts of people out on their dumb arguments, they will literally call you a racist - or in this case, a ""rabidly anti-Semitic, alt-right, misogynist, extreme libertarian crypto-anarchist"" (lol, okay). This guy was dredging up posts from *4chan* to make his points. Of course, he didn't bother to address me, even though my response was the one that got the most attention and was even mentioned on [marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-most-dangerous-threat-of-2018-and-why-we-need-to-slay-the-beast-2018-03-12). What a coward. Hey, maybe he's just upset that me calling him clueless shows up on the first page when you Google his name?

I said it before and I'll say it again. ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" We are firmly in the ""fight you"" stage.",1521314708,17/03/2018 19:25:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85610c/forbes_article_antisemitism_drives_irrational/,29

Bitcoin payment solutions for merchants that really want Bitcoin,"We are living in a world that is changing fast, but old habits and systems still hunt us and keep people minds in the same structures and old systems.  
Bitcoin come up as a revolutionary technology, that can change totally and from within the existing society, economy, financial structures and instruments. Bitcoin means freedom, means property of your own money, means control of your own money, means totally free market in a decentralized and P2P way that humanity never reached before.  

In this environment, in the last years I was involved in quite some projects to help integrating Bitcoin payments into merchants web-shops, and all people I tried to help, they wanted a simple solution that meet the following requirements:  

- to be FREE or at least for basic payments and paid for extra features, pro versions or one time payment. Some small merchants want free plugins (or at least cheap) because they are struggling with money. Some other merchants are willing to pay more for more features.  
- to be free fee, no extra charges for each tx or total volume of payments. There is no point of charging extra fees for BTC payments. We  already have VISA and Paypal for that. We use BTC exactly to get rid off extra fee of intermediaries  
- to use your own personal/merchant wallet, 100% control of your BTC, no online, no 3rd party wallet, no custodial wallet  
- to not have involved any extra 3rd intermediary in the process, no tracking, monitoring of txs or account/users. Exposing all your merchant and also customer txs to a 3rd party is a dangerous slip over. You never know when that server can be hacked, seized or monitored by any gov or other institution. Bitcoin was created and designed to be a personal payment processor exactly to avoid any intermediary intervention. **Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**    
- to be easy to integrate into Woocommerce and other shopping platforms or at least no need to contract a full team of IT specialists just to put in place a Bitcoin payment  
- do not convert your received BTC into fiat. Doesn't make sense to accept something that you throw it away. You should not accept in the first place if you don't want it.  

Many of these people start from the definition of Bitcoin from [Satoshi's papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), that stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  

That's it, no need for more explanations, simple as it is.  

So here are some of the solutions I found, studied, tested. Maybe are more, maybe some are not available anymore, but I will enumerate them here so others can see them and decide for themselves. If you know others please post here in the same manner.  
Please understand that I have nothing against any company in the field that wants to earn some extra money in this business. I am not part of any of these companies or any other company involved in Bitcoin. I am just a tehnical/business consultant that wants to help others to use Bitcoin as it is.

Any idea about this transaction from 2014 rejected by Lightning daemon 0.4-beta?,"So I've got my lnd up and starting to sync (yay!)


I get to a point where it says:  
    Couldn't parse output script in 6f8a70aac37786b1f619d40250b8bca1a1f6da487146a7e81091f611068a23ef:0: opcode OP_DATA_37 requires 38 bytes, but script only has 4 remaining


I don't really think this is a big deal, but I am interested in why this is in a block (from 2014), but seems like it can't be parsed by lnd.

Back to levels before the planned Segwit2x hard fork and when bcash started becoming an annoying nuisance,"I remember those days in the fall of 2017 when fees and transaction times were proclaimed as the long term negatives of bitcoin and that Segwit2x and bcash would the the new kings of the realm. Segwit2x failed... and bcash is, well, bcash. And I remember the day this happened and we cracked 8000 for a few minutes and then bitcoin started going down... to 4800 I believe. And then it went on to new highs DESPITE the growing fees and lagging confirmation times. 

Wasn’t like everyday we saw someone post how their transaction had been taking days, weeks, a month even, to get confirmed? Did we forget those? Where are they now? 

The current state of things would have pushed the price to 30k IF they had been a reality in the fall: increased segwit usage, lightning network going online, regulators taking a wait and see approach. Those are real things.

The factors causing it to go down haven’t been real. Classic FUD. S Korean crackdown... mmm not so much. China banning miners. Mmmmm network is still working fine. Bcash taking mining share.... lol yeah ok. Ripple becoming the latest fad.... rrrrrriiighhtttt. And a few greying senators who are in the pockets of fiat money institutions who don’t understand decentralized networks. 

The ICO scams are a real thing and perhaps this price decline will weed them out. But the long term picture remains sound. 

We WILL overtake visa. If we weren’t a threat, their CFO shouldn’t have anything to say. Him going public was the textbook equivalent of a central banker going on tv and saying “your fiat is safer with us. Don’t trust or transact that other evil stuff”.

PSA: use a mobile wallet like Samourai or a desktop wallet like Electrum to avoid overpaying fees.,"I picked a random recent [tx](https://blockchain.info/tx/6545c99ba5f51250c17d8f584117349fd154f611e6bd5920d3b69b7c54679d45), which has a fee of 862sat/byte. Here's [another tx](https://blockchain.info/tx/25fd9197085012731f4fa3b6143bd8c6889adadbd0d0ef872607211119230c10) with a fee of 0.675 sat/byte.

The first transaction is not unusual, so many people/exchanges are overpaying by 1000x what they need to (even if using the old ""1"" format addresses for the inputs, segwit reduces fees but not by that much!).

At this time, 1 sat/byte is fine for almost all transactions.

The latest Electrum wallet lets you manually set the fee easily to the level you like in sat/byte, and the Samourai mobile wallet does the same.

So don't trust the fee estimating algorithms. They are difficult to implement and thus so far wildly innaccurate.

Should blocks get full again and you need to adjust to higher fees, [Earn](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) has a good tool to quickly check what fee to use.",1521351546,18/03/2018 05:39:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/859htd/psa_use_a_mobile_wallet_like_samourai_or_a/,42

F.U.N.D.A.M.E.N.T.A.L.S beat short-term sentiments.,"Bitcoin and other cryptocoins will go massively up mid- to long-term because the long-term market and technical fundamentals are ever more solid and revolutionary.

2 examples:

1) More governments (US, France recently) are regulating crypto: not saying it should be banned but saying that abuses should be prevented and more importantly that they should not deter companies in the sector, let them move in another country and miss the boat.

2) Lightning Network now in production / main net: do you realize how a breakthrough this is??? It brings several orders of magnitude speed improvement AND much lower costs AND further decentralization AND the possibility of direct swaps with other coins.

Bearswarms vs Bullswarms,"I think the game is already ongoing so it's better to balance it up in both directions. Swarms/pools of traders that cooperate via closed groups could in theory manipulate the market and cause dips and peaks through pooled market pressure from buying or selling in unison.

The benefit of investing through a swarm is that if everyone in the swarm coordinate their tactic, there is less risk on the individual investor. If the swarm decides to buy, even if it merely entails $100 per person and market bid, there is upwards pressure as one buyer places a buy order over the last bid. In reverse, following the actions of a bearswarm, there is downward sale pressure from bids below the last bid.

When the bullswarm has exhausted its economic pressure it can cash out, wait a bit for a minor drop (which should be quickened by the fact that they cash out some of their BTC) and reinvest for the next climb. The combined liquidity of the swarm protects the individual investor from the risks of timing the market.

Let's give the bearswarms a match and some unpredictability to their game. Pool together and cause the bears to fomo back in or fall out of the game. I am not telling anyone to inflate the price, but rather to counteract downwards market manipulation. Don't give them a safe game, put up some resistance.

FUD in forums doesn't normally carry much weight. However, when bearswarms coordinate tactics, causing fear and uncertainty will certainly benefit their game.

Pool together and stay safe. The upwards mobility of the market is just as profitable as the downwards mobility. That's all.

Anyone from Ireland and know how to purchase bitcoin with a public service card as ID?,"Slight warning - I'm new to bitcoin buying so please don't hurt me.  

I'm in need of some bitcoin to buy a VPN that I've been meaning to try out, but every single seller (coinbase, paymium, etc) have been declining my photo ID which is a valid form of identification within this country,  
I don't have any other form of ID as they all cost money and I'm cheap so I'm kind of lost as to what I'm supposed to do.  
Should I just mine the money and skip this BS (It's not more than 10 Euro)

"Sad payment choices for ""Bitcoin""","Recently tried buying a gift card on Gyft.com and apparently the only choices for payment with Bitcoin is with either Coinbase or BitPay.

I don't have a Coinbase account and one is required to pay with Bitcoin. This makes NO sense. I already have a Bitcoin wallet, why am I forced to use Coinbase? Whatever, so I tried to sign up for a Coinbase account, and apparently they require a bunch of personal information including your phone number which there is no way in hell I'm giving anyone this private data. Screw Coinbase.

So then I look at payment with BitPay and it's clearly Roger Ver Bitcoin Cash promoter, saying they are going to charge extra fees just for using real Bitcoin during a time when mining fees are at an all-time-low. What the hell is this? Why would they even list a scam like Bitcoin Cash along side Bitcoin? Do they not do any due diligence? 

Really disappointing.

Am I the only one wondering what the hell happened to the promise of Bitcoin as payment without being managed by authorities? I feel like this whole experience is managed by BitPay and Coinbase.

It sure doesn't take long for principles to get ignored in the quest for market share.

But, I think there is an opportunity here for some player to come in and really expand the real Bitcoin ecosystem while these terrible systems using BitPay and Coinbase die off.

I really think these systems are 100% antithetical to what Bitcoin is and why people are actually interested in it to begin with.

As long as Coinbase and BitPay are the middlemen of payments, we the people lose.

We really need to highlight parts of the economy that are amazing and true to autonomic authority-free payments, and continue to warn others against these pseudo-Bitcoin systems that are really just a bad version of Paypal or Apple Pay.

I am really excited when businesses decide to accept Bitcoin payments, but most of the time it seems like principles and ethos and community are all ignored and the only reason they are accepting Bitcoin are for gimmicks and anti-consumer traps.

Can we donate portions of BTC funds to area governments to cover cost of implementation of acceptance for payments of things like parking meters etc...,"We would just neet to agree on an amount of cost to cover such an upgrade to a specific service in a specific area and have someone from that jurisdiction attend local meetings, get it on the ballot and see what happens.  I think that no cost upgrades might be enticing to local governments with limited budgets.  That also takes away their main reason for saying no.  

How much would it cost to upgrade parking meters that currently accept digital funds via credit / debit / parking app? Maybe target an area like that first if it is more cost effective then offering a digital upgrade to the standard coin drop and twist?

Just thinking out loud, but that would really help spread awareness depending on population and tourist traffic as well as offer day to day usefulness.  Who knows, if it goes well in one area maybe other areas will pick it up on their own dime?

Next Wednesday is the milestone for Bitcoin!!!,"The G20 meeting will affect the direction of Bitcoin in the next six months.
If the good Bitcoin signal will increase again to 9k3 - 9k7, Bitcoin will cross the two markers up to 11k8 (hope)
If it is bad signal Bitcoin will continue to fall and I see milestone 5k4 - 5k6. Hope this is the last milestone, but if one or more FUD I see bitcoin down to 4k2.
In both directions, Bitcoin will return to 15k in November 2018. This year, Bitcoin will not be able to return to its highest level since 2017.
The 15k - 20k mark will be a stable benchmark in the future of Bitcoin (2020).
Government wants to manage, and large financial institutions need Bitcoin stable easy to control. All existing FUDs seem to be controlled for this purpose.
Altcoin will cleanse this year, lots of Altcoin will disappear from the trading floor. Altcoin will go down the milestone you did not expect. Altcoin extant in November 2018, still bounced back to their highest level last year and will cross strong.

Huge Coinance Update: API Exchange Integrations and Android Launch Announcement To Become the Most Beautiful Cryptocurrency Management App,"Dear reddit community,

first of all a huge thanks to all of you, who have reached out to us after our launch three weeks ago. We have listened and implemented your feedback, suggestions and learned from every comment or message you wrote us. Therefore, all the exciting new features were built based on your ideas and I am very happy to announce the following two major updates:

From today, we are launching the iOS Version 1.1 which includes the integration of 6 cryptocurrency exchanges. We will support from today GDAX, Coinbase, Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken and Poloniex and you will be able to connect your API key / secret (or scan the QR code) or login (Coinbase) to get live information about your portfolio. With this step we will move closer into the direction of becoming a crypto management app. In case you don’t know how to do this, we will upload a tutorial tomorrow on our Medium blog how to add the exchanges.

Before the first of you express their concerns about the potential security risk of Coinance and your API keys, I want to directly address the most important thing upfront: We value your privacy and API key pair’s security above all and won’t collect any unnecessary data. All API key pairs are securely encrypted within Keychain and never leave your device. Nothing is being sent to our servers. By that we leave the power over the key pairs to you and reduce the risk of becoming a target for hacks. I even felt the need to further address these concerns in a separate blog article where I showcase on a code example how we handle your API keys. You can find the the article on our Medium blog.

Second big announcement is our Android version. Many of you have reached out to us since our last post and asked when it will be available. Therefore I want to first give a huge props to our 2 Android devs Chris and Max, who have rocked this thing in such a short time! We are in the last few steps of testing. The first version will have the features of our first iOS launch version: toplist, favorite list, detail charts, price alerts and news. We are working very hard to bring the Android version on sync with iOS within the next few weeks too! If you want to be among the first Android users, we will selectively invite people on a rolling basis form a list where you can sign up. I'll post the link in the comment section later.

Lastly I want to invite all of you again to leave us questions, suggestions or feature wishes here in the comment section. We will try to answer all of them and we are seeking the conversation with you what we should build next for you! If you want to further stay in touch or found a bug, feel free to directly reach out to me or join our Telegram group.

Also again as a side note: This is a weekend / evening project so far. Therefore don’t be too angry with us if the App could crash. Rather send us a message and we’ll try to fix it asap for you!

Besides that, have a great weekend and hodl on! The whole Coinance team",1521384842,18/03/2018 14:54:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85bodb/huge_coinance_update_api_exchange_integrations/,96

Email from my Aunt about Bitcoin,"Long-time reddit lurker here. With some folks bummed about the dip, thought  I would post an entertaining email just received from my old, but charming aunt.  A little backstory, my dad passed away about 6 months ago. Which has been very difficult, but he would have laughed so much at this.  Pay particular attention to the last two sentences. I’m so tempted to send a search party over to his house to find the loose “BitCoin”. :). See below:

“Some time in the last few years, during a visit to his house, he showed me a BitCoin.  Said someone had given it to him as payment for something or another and did I know anything about it?  Neither of us did at that time as it will not that well known, and obviously not worth a whole lot back then.  Then in the last year or two he said he was thinking of buying some bitcoin but I never heard if he did or not.  I wonder what ever happened to that BitCoin?  Knowing how he always had loose change laying around, it may have been rolled into some quarters or something.  Don’t suppose Dani has found it in the house somewhere?”

Bitcoin Price != Bitcoin,"I believe all price related posts, both positive and negative, should be banned from r/Bitcoin. There are many people angry at HODLers (why does it concern you what others do?) and others are throwing out random price predictions. Frankly, both are annoying. The reality is Bitcoin today is working as well as ever. There are new technological developments every single day. Let’s focus on the awesome work people are doing to CONTRIBUTE. Not monetarily contribute for selfish gain, but real value creation.

When we focus on the amazing technological developments, we as Bitcoin supporters can not lose. There is no volatility in this context, only innnovation and the willingness to try, fail, and try again, until success is reached and a new goal is in sight. Lightning Network, Schnorr, the list goes on. 

To think we are ranting or raving about USD wealth is absolutely absurd. Fiat is a debt based monetary system that isn’t sustainable because the world has finite resources. One cannot simply continue to consume more forever. 

Put aside the price of Bitcoin. Doing so will remove any power that the naysayers have. ",1521395244,18/03/2018 17:47:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85csj9/bitcoin_price_bitcoin/,1

"Bahrain’s Government is Keen on Adopting Bitcoin, Reveals Official","Bahrain is interested in adopting digital currencies like bitcoin amid a wider impetus toward a ‘country level’ adoption of blockchain technologies.
The Kingdom of Bahrain, a constitutional monarchy of over 30 islands in the Persian Gulf, is taking a bitcoin-friendly approach in its advent to become a FinTech hub in the region.
Speaking at the MIT Innovation Forum in Bahrain’s capital of Manama on Wednesday, Khalid Al Rumaihi, chief executive of Bahrain’s Economic Development Board revealed plans toward installing a regulatory sandbox in the country. The EDB is a government agency tasked to plan and implement the country’s economic development strategy.
In response to a query about cryptocurrencies at the event, Al Rumaihi was reported by The Hindu Business Line as stating:
We are open to Bitcoins.
Notably, Al Rumaihi indicated that Bahrain’s Finance Ministry – the country’s financial regulator and watchdog – was also keen on adopting digital currencies like bitcoin.
Intriguingly, the government official revealed that a bitcoin exchange operator in Saudi Arabia made inquires toward establishing a bitcoin exchange in Bahrain. “We are working with the Central Bank of Bahrain on this,” Al Rumaihi added.
Furthermore, he also revealed the extent to which Bahrain could adopt and use digital currencies by suggesting that Bahrain could also issue bonds on a digital currency.
All digital currency-related developments in the private sector would occur in a regulatory sandbox recently unveiled by the country’s central bank, a move toward endearing itself as the FinTech hub in the region.
Al Rumaihi stated:
This [regulatory sandbox] is much like Singapore and what the UK is looking at. This is not just talk. We have launched it. You can go to the website and [the] application process is clear. We are open for business.
As CCN reported in February this year, Bahrain unveiled grand plans in targeting a systemic, nationwide adoption of blockchain technologies.
Speaking at the time, Al Rumaihi said:
The ability for blockchain to be adopted at [a] country level is a huge opportunity for Bahrain to move into the spotlight as a pioneer in this space.
The following month, Bahrain signed a FinTech pact with Singapore, widely seen as the foremost FinTech hubs in the world. The Middle Eastern monarchy is tapping Singapore’s expertise in financial technologies to establish its own FinTech ecosystem in the region, complete with its own regulatory sandbox.
Bahrain’s bitcoin-friendly stance proves contrary to recently publicized statements by JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, who has repeatedly claimed that governments will put the brakes on bitcoin.",1521396376,18/03/2018 18:06:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85cx7c/bahrains_government_is_keen_on_adopting_bitcoin/,3

Virtual currency defined as a legal currency in Wyoming.,"Hey everyone! I have recently decided to get as direct to the sources from what I have been seeing and hearing in the news regarding crypto. Recently I Interviewed Tyler Lindholm, a State Representative from Wyoming. He had a large part in constructing the crypto bills that were passed just recently. They are the first in the world to do this and it may have a huge impact.

6:00- We start to talk about the Bills.

10:20- Set up file 111. This is very interesting.

Reasons to be optimistic,"Good news gets discounted during prolonged price corrections - nobody believes good news when they’re depressed. But we’ve had the price correction, let’s take stock of the good news.

High fees have gone away. The December frenzy is past, the January and February space-hogging defrag catch up has finished. The mempool is regularly emptying and 1 sat/byte usually gets you into the next block. (Some wallets and users are paying *way* more than necessary, but they'll get the message.)

Meanwhile batching is reducing calls on blockspace and segwit is increasing blocksize: effective throughput capacity will have, what, doubled by May? Backlog build ups will become a distant memory, fear of them will recede.

Lightning is in beta. Assuming Lightning works – and it will – the implications are immense: bitcoin adoption far beyond us nerds, enthusiasts and Redditors. 

We are at the start of something big. Hodl and use.

A short piece on mass media generated FUD,"This is a French journal 

https://investir.lesechos.fr/marches/bitcoin-cryptomonnaies/g20-le-fsb-rejette-les-appels-a-une-regulation-des-cryptomonnaies-1750099.php

Here is a translation of the title they chose : ""The FSB (Financial stability board for the G20) rejects calls for crypto assets regulation""
That's a fair title because that was the main news-worthy event.

Now let's look at Bloomberg's title : https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-18/growth-of-crypto-assets-may-threaten-financial-system-fsb-says ""Growth of crypto assets may threaten financial system, FSB says""


No need to look further down, with a title like that, you know it only meant to generate FUD while they should have a title similar to Les Echos as that was the most important piece of news. Quite pathetic of Bloomberg...

Average cost of mining one bitcoin: At which rate does it increase?,"Hi

I have searched the internet about it and as far as I can tell the average price of mining one bitcoin at the moment is around 6000 USD. Since the complexity of the algorithm increases in the future and the reduction of the mining rewards make it even more expensive, what is the rate these costs are expected to rise? In theory this should always define the minimum price of one bitcoin doesn't it?

The Nicehash hacker.,"After the Nicehash theft, I watched the account that received just that much BTC. 

https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1EnJHhq8Jq8vDuZA5ahVh6H4t6jh1mB4rq

Nothing happened right away. But I just checked it again. What you can see is that initially the BTC was worth ~55 million. The price jumped and eventually it was around 77 million. Once the value started to go down the BTC was transferred out in 1000 BTC chunks. The accounts that it was transferred to also transferred out and most of the time sent 100 BTC to other accounts first. I haven’t followed them all down from there because it then goes into wallets that are full of transactions. Some of us may have some of those BTC right now.

MIT Bitcoin Expo 2018 - Day 2,"Day 1 videos have been removed from YouTube after the stream ended, hopefully they will reupload them at some point.

If they do we'll repost these with all of them, I'm assuming these Day 2 streams won't be here tomorrow.

If anyone managing this conference is reading this, in the future please reach out to us ahead of time so we can get these streams stickied sooner. I think we can all agree that ""3 watching"" is a disservice to these great presentations.

Is the Lightning beta ready for merchants to test? Or not quite yet?,"I'm not really clear on the stage of lightning network beta, is it just for developers to begin testing, or is it also ready for merchants to begin testing?

My question is based on the thought I had today, that I miss seeing the posts of a shopfront with a ""bitcoin accepted here"" sticker. My (limited) understanding of the lightning network would be that:

* Merchant/shop opens a lightning channel
* Customers can pay through lightning network to merchant/shop owner

Are we at that stage with the beta? Or do specific apps need to be developed first for merchants and customers?",1521425268,19/03/2018 02:07:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85g432/is_the_lightning_beta_ready_for_merchants_to_test/,4

I run a airport shuttle bus in Australia and put a 'Bitcoin accepted here' sign in the bus. This is what most people think.,"I have had the sign up for about 8 months. My passengers are mainly 35 y/o +

85% of passengers make a remark about the sign and are suprised to see it. They say I am the first person they have seen that accepts Bitcoin as payment.

Nearly all of those passenger have heard of it prior to seeing the sign but are confused about it and have been wrongly informed. Common remarks are ""how do you give me change from a $10,000 coin?"" ""It's easy for hackers to steal all the coins"" ""how do you even pay with Bitcoin?"".

As a Bitcoin/crypto supporter I feel I need to do my part in educating people and keep spreading the good word of our Bitcoin overlord.

The sign is a great conversation starter and even though no one has paid me with crypto (yet) I look forward to the day it happens.",1521426508,19/03/2018 02:28:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85g8ij/i_run_a_airport_shuttle_bus_in_australia_and_put/,1958

Russians Call For ‘Crypto Hour’ - Turn Off All Mining Equipment For Ecological Awareness,"Earth Hour, a grassroots movement within the World Wildlife Fund to turn off all electricity for a single hour once a year as a way to draw attention to energy consumption, will be celebrated by Russian miners this year as well with the creation of “Crypto Hour,” local news outlet Ramblerreported March 15.
In order to remind the crypto sphere of the need for more ecologically friendly Blockchain technologies, Russian crypto miners have asked all miners internationally to turn off their miningequipment on March 24, from 20:30 - 21:30 (local time).
The Russian site for Earth Hour shows that over 50,000 people have promised online to participate in the hour-long blackout, whose motto is “Vote for Nature,”. The website also allows participants to vote for protecting natural land reserves, using green energy and recycling, with their votes sent to the future president of Russia.

How is that Central Bankers and FUD creating media is bullying bitcoin so easily? Dont we have any influencial people supporting crypto and blockchain?,"I know there are many influential people. But still, till yesterday bitcoin was dipping so hard scared of G20 summit. And when the news came out that there wont be any regulations soon on crypto, BTC started rising. Thats so strange that we as a community dont have any influential voice. Why the f**k govt will decide where we can invest our money. They dont care if we take bad loans with super high interests, buy useless products, but when we buy crypto they go so 'concerned' about us and want to protect us.

Wallet.dat file // Bitcoin software version 0.10,"Hi guys,

got a special request, do you have an old Wallet.dat file (needs to be used, ie with incoming and outgoing transactions, even a very small transactions will do) from the very 1st Bitcoin Software version 0.1.0 (can be also 0.1.1-0.1.9).

Obviously need to file WITHOUT any coins on it, Wink

If you have such a file, I am happy to pay something small for it.

Please avoid misleading titles about G20,"Hey guys - Please stop spreading false news about G20 so-called announcements.

Yesterday, one lobbyist just told that he does not support cryptocurrency regulation. This does not mean that G20 will not pave the way to more regulation. There was a big BTC bump after this news was released, probably to be followed by a big dump when traders will realize that there will be additional regs shortly following the G20 (this is what may happen IMHO).

Actually several countries (France, USA, Germany,...) will actually push for implementing tougher crypto regulation.

So, again, please be more fact-driven and cut this propaganda because, after reading your (deliberately?) incorrect, people will get disappointed when they see the probable dip following the G20 announcements (that will unfortunately/likely generate more stringent regulations)...",1521459985,19/03/2018 11:46:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85iu93/please_avoid_misleading_titles_about_g20/,2

Duplicate encrypted wallets question.,"I have the same wallet on both my laptop &amp; desktop. Of course not a good idea but bear with me. They are both encrypted with the same passphrase as one was simply duplicated to the other pc. The laptop is sometimes used by my wife who if she tried could possibly guess the passphrase.
From what I understand if the pass is changed on the desktop the pass does NOT change on the laptop. Meaning that my wife could still access and use the BTC. So the pass on both will need to be changed right?",1521462823,19/03/2018 12:33:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85j3zh/duplicate_encrypted_wallets_question/,0

Can we use the heat and noise for sustainable mining?,"1. I heard that many mining facilities are currently located at relatively cold countries such as Canada and Iceland. I wonder if miners can utilize the difference in temperature between the heated mining facility and cold outside. There are some related links below:

https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-use-cold-as-an-energy-source-to-generate-something

http://www.worldresearchlibrary.org/up_proc/pdf/1114-15112624331-3.pdf

3. I think, in combiation with searching for alternative schemes such as PoS, we can also try to make PoW more sustainable, because it's what the miners have to stick to for at least some time. IMHO, crypto foundations can establish a research fund to facilitate relevant studies or invest in related business. This will also reduce the negative arguments against the excessive energy use of crypto mining.",1521474194,19/03/2018 15:43:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85kf91/can_we_use_the_heat_and_noise_for_sustainable/,4

8 months is how long it took for me not to obsess about the bitcoin price anymore.,"I got into bitcoin last August and I have to admit I went through a little period of anxiety and obsession constantly checking the price and worrying about selling at highs and buying at lows like any good bitcoiner does.

But recently, I naturally found myself not caring much anymore (even during this recent correction).  I check occasionally but I've reached a point where I'm just kind of a lazy hodler.  It may not be best for my portfolio, but it's good for my mind and body.

Some Lightning Questions,"I spent some time over the weekend setting up LND and having a play around, hopefully someone can answer some questions i have.

1) Security of nodes

With nodes having to sign changes of channels this made me think about the security. Your private key must be loaded and available to sign changes to channels / peers and other info. Doesn't this open up these nodes as targets to hackers / malware ext.
Comparing this to someone who unlocks a wallet / private key for just doing a transaction or someone who uses a hardware wallet having the private key in play continuously seems risky?

2) Routing

How much bandwidth is expected to be used to calculate routes and routes that have enough coins that could complete the payment and how other people using these routes affects your's. I am unclear on how this actually works?

3) An issue with channels?

Say a shop sets up a connection with some nodes, as the shop is mainly receiving money (payments) the channels need to start out weighted towards the node. This means the node either needs to start the connection and fund it or the shop needs to fund the other end (which would be pointless as they would then be reviving their own money). And unless the shop actually sent money back through the channels to exchanges or paid for expenses / staff through lightning network before long these channels would end up useless as the money would be completely at the shops and requiring them to be closed and re-opened and funded.

Responsibility. Frustration. Acceptance.,"As early adopters we must realize that becoming enlightened means we are given the power of influence. Regardless of all the FUD it is obvious that cryptocurrencies are becoming more widely adopted and recognized. 
That being said, we live in an age of fake news. No longer do facts and logic give way to understanding. The people that have doubts are deeply ingrained in their reality and therefore we must undertake the annoying and tedious task of walking them through the concept step by step. 

Very intelligent individuals are the ones most likely to give unadulterated hate. The smart ones are capable of doing exorbitant amounts of mental gymnastics to reconcile their trust of the current financial system. It is the definition of an uphill battle but in the end technology and simplicity will prevail.

Can't update to the latest Ledger Nano S firmware,"So I've had this whole issue when the Ledger displays ""Update"" and the Ledger Manager displays the default screen of ""please connect a ledger"" screen. Even when I clicked the button next to the USB port and then connected, it would try to reset MCU and after a few seconds the Manager would return to the same default screen.

After many searches (as well as the Ledger Nano S support page), I realized that I should check my Device Manager for a yellow triangle next to a USB port. I did it (even though I've tried many ports to no avail, previously), and it really showed a yellow triangle. I updated the driver, then connected my ledger, and unlike others, who have reported that this has fixed the issue for them, my issue persists, with a minor change - now the Manager doesn't display the default screen. Upon connecting, it first shows [this](https://i.imgur.com/3X1gDFG.png), then, after  clicking ""continue"" and ""install"" again, it displays [this](https://i.imgur.com/vkfkcMb.png). My Ledger still displays ""Update.""

Has anyone come across this issue, or should I just send the logs to Ledger's support? Came here as a last resort because I feel like I've hit a dead end. Can't find anything online.

Thanks!

**EDIT:** I haven't done anything differently, but after a while, I tried again (for the 28173th time), and it actually worked. Oh well.

**EDIT II:** Actually, I just realized that it was with the other USB. So maybe after a few tries do the trick? Not sure. I've given many attempts with the different USB (as suggested below), but once it showed no difference I just put it a side and tried again. So for you readers from the future - give it a shot.

How is LN going to be used for mass adoption if every LN user is supposed to be remain online?,"A couple of things, I am confused with.

The eClair wallet which is BTC/LN compatible, is only a pay wallet. Here is a quote,

&gt; https://medium.com/@ACINQ/announcing-eclair-wallet-a8d8c136fc7e
Which leads to our second design decision: you can only pay with this wallet on LN, not receive funds. We think it is acceptable because the main use case for a mobile app is for paying anyway.

Of course, in the future, we will be able to remove this limitation using the upcoming trustless third-party watchers, but we don’t have them now.
It does not allow users to receive funds into their LN wallet because that requires running a full node in order to be sure you are not being fed fake transactions. There is supposedly a third party watchers coming out? What is that?

The solution, seems to be that anyone who wants to use the LN will need to run a full node as well as the LN software on top of it on a server/computer. There can be mobile wallets that act as remote controllers for the LN wallet that is on the server/computer. 

What do you guys think about this? I can't imagine the average person going and setting up a bitcoin full node and LN on top and always leaving their PC on. There is a device called Litbox from Vertcoin team coming out that is plug and play but I also can't imagine average people purposefully spending on a box so they can send/receive money, they will just use their credit card?",1521492362,19/03/2018 20:46:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85mwen/how_is_ln_going_to_be_used_for_mass_adoption_if/,2

How do you use btc efficiently to purchase things,"Made a purchase with a Registered California Dispensary and it was the worst purchase experience of my life trying to use bitcoin to buy something for the first time, but a learning one at that.

I called them, went to my computer, looked up a btc to usd converter, looked up a btc to mBtc converter since electrum shows mBtc(hopefully a setting I can change lmk) so I don't screw it up myself, sent the btc, sent screenshots, sent transaction id, ended up 2 hours later when the payment was done being settled with them saying they don't deliver to my area. And a night spent with no tree after the hype of getting some with btc since I didn't have cash on me. Made btc seem utterly useless and I would probably pay 1% fee for a transaction I can trust and is instant, not ~30min confirmation time. Can bitcoin actually beat PayPal/venmo?

So I send them my wallet address and qr code, they respond saying great they'll refund it immediately, didn't send me anything, contacted last week no response. Got someone this week agreeing that they can still refund it.

Meanwhile a little bit of my coin is chillin somewhere I have no idea. Could've been such an easy scam but I'm pretty sure it isn't. If it is I might have to buy a shotgun and go hunting for knees.

We are about to start an open source offline tax calulcation project for all of your crypto gains. Help wanted!,"## Motivation  
Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. However, this does not mean that crypto will supersede FIAT in the short or middle  term nor do we believe that any crypto investor living on a governed ground should provide a sore point to his own person due to his personal financial decisions. Taxes have to be paid.  
  
Taxes are paid in FIAT and even if they are paid in crypto like at least two states in the US are seriously pursuing right now, taxes still have to be calculated. That is not an easy task for the casual and even for the experienced crypto investor who has not reached his moon, yet. This day will come for each individual and it will create headaches how exactly his tax authority is treating yet unknown territory.  
  
We, I mean you too, want to help out. In an open source project, we want to provide a tool for personal research on your current tax situation regarding your crypto-financial situation. This should be offline, secure, open source and in your own control and decisions.  
  
## The Project  
Soon, we will open a GitHub repository where everyone can take his favorite role if he likes to lay hands on. We would like to start up the project in the interpreting script language Python as the main language. Python 3 to be exact. We believe this is performant enough for the scope of the project and easy enough that even interested non-programmers can learn super fast. Also, code interested people coming from another main language read python like pseudo code.   
  
While Python will handle the backend work, there is need of a frontend. For rapid code-prototyping and since the whole project is targeting an offline usage, we would like to use a local webserver with a PHP/JS/HTML/CSS GUI. Our goal is to expand this to binary packages for Linux, macOS and Windows at the first major release.  
  
The project will start with a simple tax calculation method like FIFO and an CSV list of trades on an example exchange as proof of concept. The more participants' PRs come in, the faster we can specialize different countries' calculation methods, tax percentages and legislations.  
  
The first GUI output should be a clear compilation of taxable events as well as a figure of the amount to be taxed and the value to refund to the tax authority. Additionally, there should be a generated conclusion regarding the crypto tax legislation of the considered country to further education of the user.   
  
## How is this funded?  
Well, it isn't. Funding is needed for time non-voluntarily spent. We do spend time for this as a group of friends, fully voluntarily. However, you who want to participate, might not. We have thought of that and came up with two ideas:    
  
 * Repository PRs wear your Bitcoin address. This will receive donations from project viewers or whoever wants to donate. Since we are living in an economical world, maybe the feature of your PR is desperately needed which is reflected in the average amount donated to your PR. This is a clear indicator to address it fast.  
 * There could be created a smart contract (e. g. on the ethereum blockchain) which is funded by donations and the output heights each timeframe are voted by all commiters and equally distributed across the commits of this timeframe.  
  
Whatever it will be, we know you make the right decision in the open source project. By the way, we intend to use the 
MIT License for the project.

## Who is ""we""?  
Regarding the future project, ""we"" is everyone participating, contributing and using the open source code and program. Right now ""we"" are students, long lurkers of r/bitcoin, newbe crypto investors with more losses than gains and curious observers of the coming months and more important the coming years in the crypto scene.  
  
""We"" believe Bitcoin is not only changing the way we interact with money, but a disruptive movement how ownership is handled in the world. Blockchain is the key technology, cryptocurrencies are phenomena of change but Bitcoin is the community which is here to stay. Ask yourself who is meant with the last ""we"".  
  
## Help is Wanted
While this is an introducing post for the intended project, we are relying on your help in the project. We would like to have the code work for your country, for your governmental institution, for your tax, for you. So please, comment, suggest, propose, criticize and most importantly participate. Help us now by committing your opinion to the following questions:  

 * Why is this probably the worst idea in the ""new"" newsfeed of r/bitcoin?  
 * Which concerns do you have?  
 * What feature is needed and why?  
 * Where is the crux of the matter?   
 * Are you willing to participate?  
 * Why is your countries tax regulation up in the priority list?  
 * What is your priority list in general?  
 * Where can this project get resources from?  
 * How should local bitcoins be handled?
 * Why is your favorite exchange high in the priority list?
 * Do you know the current tax situation in your governance?  
 * Are you a legal advisor regarding taxes and establishing a new field of business in the crypto scene? Are you feared of your business model? Remember, you can participate with valuable input. We are not taking away your customer who wants to get rid of time consuming procedures. We want to let the educated and interested crypto investor make pre-calculations before he is choosing the way he is getting his taxes done - maybe by you.
 * Is the MIT License the wrong choice? Tell us why.
 * Do you have a fancy name? We do have one but maybe yours is better. Be sure to be credited.

So I went to check out their headquarters office in London and it's completely fake. There is no one from Cointal there, and there is an accounting firm there who said that Cointal/Coinket was never at that address and they should not be using that address as it was illegal and fraudulent. 

Here is their ""office"" at 63 Loveridge Road

I contacted UK police and they said the same thing:

There is an issue with our tax law and the future vision of Bitcoin and nobody is bringing this up!,"If any of you have watched the last two senate/committee meetings (idk what they are), either with the chairman of both the SEC and CFTC or with the panelists, it seems the main priority is on establishing the difference between securities and commodities.

However, nobody has spoken about current tax law regarding crypto to crypto trades and that being a taxable event. This is a case where regulation could stifle innovation and hurt the technology (as they say) yet none have brought up this issue?

If you believe Bitcoin is going to be valuable as a currency, then an integral aspect of that vision is being able to pay a merchant who accepts BTC with other lightning enabled coins by use of Atomic swaps which is built on top of the lightning network. This will essentially turn many merchants into frauds....or could deter exchanges from utilizing atomic swaps features.

I am pretty sure even if we do not make a gain or loss we are required to report that on our tax sheets?

"Which Is Greater, The Number Of Observable Particles In the Universe Or The Number Of Available Bitcoin Addresses?","The commonly accepted answer for the number of particles in the observable universe is 10^80, or 1.0000000000000001e+80. This number would include the total of the number of protons, neutrons, neutrinos and electrons.

REFERENCE: https://www.quora.com/How-many-particles-are-there-in-the-universe

The total Bitcoin address space, or maximum number of possible Bitcoin addresses, is 2^160 or 1.461501637330903e+48

REFERENCE: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=24268.0

This means there are vastly more particles in the universe than possible bitcoin addresses. As a matter of fact, for every possible bitcoin address there are  6.842277657836022e+31 particles, or, 

68,422,776,578,360,220,000,000,000,000,000 particles for every single Bitcoin address. 

In other words, a blockchain whos address space was equivalent to the number of observable particles in the universe would be hella secure.",1521504224,20/03/2018 00:03:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85odii/which_is_greater_the_number_of_observable/,13

Also if the stock price changes can I literally get more for my dollar on the Silk Road or do prices fluctuate based on bitcoin price correlation

"Sorry if off-topic, but Blockfolio is requiring me to update the app, and I can't use it for anything unless I do. My thoughts.","I understand there are times that something absolutely needs to be updated before it would be acceptable to continue using it, but based on the functionality of Blockfolio I can't imagine what that would be.  I'm not at risk of losing coin or fiat, I don't have firm links to my trading accounts.  It has occurred to me, in the past, that the data that's generate by Blockfolio users could be leveraged to the app designer's benefit.  Scrape the data and pase it a few different ways and you can have a decent insight into peoples' trading behaviors - especially when looking at holdings and alerts.  

So, I'm wondering if (and not to get too /r/conspiracy here) the developer has now found a way to further benefit from that insight, and included whatever functionality in this update.  I think what I find strangest is that I literally can't even access my alerts, holdings - anything - unless I update.  

Perhaps people will say 'it's free, and if we're ok with giving the developer this data if he finds a way to profit from it that's not a huge deal; however, if it's about making $ off the app, I'd rather have free / paid versions so it comes more organically.

I am not accusing the developer of anything, but it does seem odd that there's nothing about the update on their twitter feed, and given what I was able to do with the app before the update was release, why can't I do a single thing now?",1521509416,20/03/2018 01:30:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85oz46/sorry_if_offtopic_but_blockfolio_is_requiring_me/,0

Apples and oranges,"Our (and others’) Government is all up in arms because “the people need to be protected” by possible scams when trading cryptos. 
The SEC says regulation is necessary, the G20 hold meeting over meeting, the IMF director even call for a worldwide ban, all of this with the STATED purpose to prevent fraud and money laundering. 
But all of these entities are fine and dandy with the stock markets. 
Then over the past two weeks, a tweet -A TWEET! - from Rihanna and another one by Kylie Jenner (hardly finance powerhouses) cause billions of $ to vaporize from the stock value of some US listed companies.  
And nobody says anything.
What does that tell me?

How would you feel about the concept of writing checks in Bitcoin?,"I think part of people's inability to grasp the real revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin is the difficulty in spending it. But people these days accept the mostly digital aspects of FIAT. They use mobile banking, and often take pictures of checks which get deposited into bank accounts.  

I'm imaging that if a major exchange were to allow customers to write checks, the range of things you could use BTC for could expand quite a bit [haha], making it much more accessible. Sure it's essentially a slap in the digital face, but honestly people just won't get it until they can spend it.  Perhaps masking the future in an outdated medium would help gain wider adoption. Just an idea. Maybe I'm an idiot.

I think I have invested the right amount because of this...,"I’m finding now that when it dips low and I feel compelled to buy more I think, “but could I stomach it halving?” and don’t buy more. When it goes up I think, “I could sell but would be pissed then if it went higher.” So, I don’t sell. Thus, I think I have finally invested exactly what I’m willing to lose and no more. (Hoping not to lose anything but to get to spend it in the future in place of fiat and be able to buy more when more disposable income.) Thought I would share the moment though as I feel like I can finally stop checking the price obsessively and hodl in peace. Hoping others might benefit from my experience. If you really only have invested what you can lose you can, in fact, sleep at night. Thought it is still hard to not wince below 8k. Hope this helps.

They want Bitcoin, I'm digital treasure
Well if you want Bitcoin, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of hash mixed with some cryptograph
Some blocks that will jump start my heart quicker
Then some zeros when I get proof at the nonce level
By the miner when I'm operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's mining ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the ledger and consolidating
I know you got a job Mr. Dimon 
But your J.P Morgan Chase’s corruption is compounding
So the SEC won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on Google with policy
But it feels so empty without me

So don’t sell the dip, hodl at the hip 
Fuck that, buy the dips and some more on the lower dips
And get ready 'cause this shit is about to get heavy
I just crushed global regulators, ""Fuck you, G-20!”

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a new economy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to 60 minutes
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells “32-bit!”
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' financial system, a rebel
So, let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone signing up to meta mask
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my blockchain you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your ledger, sync it and then I'm gonna end up

Scary prediction of bitcoin prices you wouldn't believe..,"I did some plotting of bitcoin prices from Aug 2010 to present March 2018 and there were some unbelievable results for predictions of the future prices of bitcoin.

The ""fair value"" I got for this month is around $7765 usd. Therefore anything under this price is undervalued and you should buy as much as possible. For April, prices under $8593 are a steal. This doesn't seem very high but keep in mind 2017 saw massive gains. But the ride is going to get crazier.

Since Bitcoin is very volatile, prices can go much higher than the ""fair value"" or lower but usually higher as people will often speculate on the future prices. On the Dec mania, it was 3 times more than the ""fair value"". Anything 2 times more should be a selling signal already.

Anyway, I have calculated that we will reach 20k maybe not as soon as most would like, we will reach it on Dec 2018, exact price is $19,324. Again this is the ""fair value"" calculated but the speculated or actual price can be 2 or 3 times higher if there is a mania phase again. Meaning possible it could reach $60k by EOY 2018 even if we see the same mania as last year.

By then things start to get crazy. $1 million does not seem so improbable, even $5 million is not impossible. If it reaches $5 million USD most people will predict the collapse of the US dollar with bitcoin becoming the world currency.

Timeline of the ""fair value"" of BTC according to my plotted graph: (EOY = End Of Year)

EOY 2018: $20k

EOY 2019: $65k

EOY 2020: $220k

EOY 2021: $740k

EOY 2022: $2.5mil

EOY 2023: $8.5mil (Does it even matter by now?)

So the prediction is bitcoin will reach $ 1 million by 2022. and $ 5 million by 2023. At this point in 2023 the USD probably no longer exists as do most other fiat currencies. Or in another scenario they still do but bitcoin holders become incredibly rich and it will create a situation where the rich gets much richer while poor who is still clinging to fiat gets much poorer enlarging the wealth gap between the parties.",1521525944,20/03/2018 06:05:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85qikh/scary_prediction_of_bitcoin_prices_you_wouldnt/,0

Discussion about feasibility of a more adaptive capacity for bitcoin,"As we all know bitcoin has trouble in times of congested network. Sometimes tx count absolutely explodes. This can be when prices rise, or maybe in the future during consumer frenzies (christmas/black friday). Countering this are times of low activity. It would be really great to somehow ""smooth"" out these peaks, or at least alleviate the problems they cause.

My suggestion is to implement some reserved blockspace for certain transactions. This reserved blockspace can be booked by making a ""reservation transaction"" at some point in time before you want to use it. The reservation transaction be constructed so when spending an output you can refer to the reservation transaction which would allow whatever tx you have to be included in the extended blockspace, and have certain restrictions, as to how many bytes you can reserve etc. This extended blockspace is of course still subject to miner fees.

This could, in a fair way, alleviate fees somewhat during congested periods, maybe even eliminate them completely (as the congestion can be caused by even small increases in tx/s that build up over time).

The downside is that this model actually increases the overall traffic (you need to make the reservation tx), but that might not be a problem as this can be seen as some small increase from baseline in uncongested periods. During peak periods we would see increased computation cost of transmitting and validating blocks, and it may even also increase bandwidth usage more than we'd normally see (because fees would possibly be lower which normally would discourage making tx). 

Another take on this model is to only allow certain high-importance type tx's - like LN punishment tx's. The reservation tx could act as a flag that tells miners that the potential punishment tx would be included in the reserved blockspace. This is a change that can actually be implemented as a softfork using the already available blockspace I imagine. This approach would really support the security model of LN, but on the other hand it will probably create lots of disputes about ""other important tx types"".",1521533704,20/03/2018 08:15:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85r2mu/discussion_about_feasibility_of_a_more_adaptive/,0

Using blockchain to validate data,"Hey people  

friends and I were talking about blockchain and we may be onto something, but we're totally new to blockchain (as in we don't know shit about it).  

Would it be possible to:  
1 - have an installable app (for PC and cellphone) that would have the basic structure of a website; think like a facebook app but instead of just being a viewport to the facebook website, it has the files builtin to draw the website.  
2 - use blockchain as a public store of data so every client would see the same stuff and changes would be spread/validated to everyone in the network.  

The idea would be to have a website running sorta like a P2P platform, without a server to back everything, with the ""server"" being spread over to the users using blockchain.",1521549969,20/03/2018 12:46:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85seva/using_blockchain_to_validate_data/,1

The most elegant aspect of Bitcoin is that it assumes that people are greedy and will act on their own self interests,"So often in our society we devise systems that trust people to act in the interest of others.

PSA: Now is the time to get verified on your favorite exchange so you are not fumbling around and bitching last minute during the next ATH.,"**Bitching about how:**


*• Everything is broken and going to crash and burn in hell*

*• They are thieves trying to screw you over*

*• They can't get their shart together*

*• They won't respond immediately to your email that is identical to 20k other emails that they received in the past 12 hours*

*• You missed out on that sweet dip price that only lasted 12ms*

*• You missed that sweet ATH sell price that only lasted 12ms*

*• Everybody should dog pile and boycot*


**Additional notes:**

*• Assume no one takes credit cards or paypal*

*• Call your bank* **BEFORE** *you try to make a transaction* **IN** *or* **OUT** *to pre verify so you do not get flagged for a fraud transaction that has the potential to lock up funds for an indeterminable amount of time*

*• Move your funds in to the exchange the day or week before you intend to purchase*

*• If you need your funds deposited faster than a bank or wire transfer to your exchange use a debit card if the option is available*

*• make a bank transaction or a test debit card transaction before you intend to make your full buy or sell, this will give you time to work out any kinks with your bank or verification*

*• If you do not want to give access to your bank or bank debit card try using a prepaid debit card*

*• Get setup on more than one exchange to give you options if your preferred exchange goes down when you need it*

Please feel free to add to the list as it is not all inclusive.

How do I deal with Kraken screwing my friend over?,"So a buddy of mine sent Kraken $20,000 in October of last year.... It's been almost 6 months and he emailed them at the end of October regarding this transfer. They spent a full 2 months ignoring his emails after they completely stopped responding. I've tried reaching out on Twitter, escalating the tickets, PM'ing all of the staff, and emailing them, and they ANSWER, but they've been answering since the beginning of January and he still doesn't get access to the funds. Their customer support is horrendous, they've asked for the same documents 3 times, and they've been giving us the run around, first by not returning the money directly into his bank account (his bank can't reverse the transaction because the forwarding bank processed the payment properly and Kraken HAD the money, but simply lost it). Now he's simply trying to get it into the trading account, and they're still giving us the run-around. Latest email is from a customer support agent named Will: ""Will

Hi Shaya,

It's up to the discretion of our funding team. We had to place a request for the funds to be processed due to the time frame between the deposit date and now. Due to the long delay it may take some time to review the case and they also have a backlog of deposits. They will be able to assist as soon as they can.""


Does anyone have suggestions to expedite this? I feel quite bad. If you're going to ask why my friend doesn't just post on Reddit himself, he's not the most tech savvy person, and I know how these things work better than most.

I'm having fun.,"I've been really enjoying myself over the past ~6 months. I've only invested what I could afford to lose, and even though I'm down, I really have enjoyed the opportunity to learn and experience this community.

I've never felt any dread since I was prepared for this to all go to zero - and the information and ways of thinking that I've learned will ultimately be more valuable as I apply them to work and other investments!

Hopefully there are others who can experience a similar levity, openness, and curiosity that I've tried to approach the space with.

A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation,"This is [not a note](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07702) from a Central Bank about current monetary strategy. Or Satoshi speaking from beyond the grave.

No. Its Stephen Hawking's [final masterpiece](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-end-universe-world-death-smooth-exit-eternal-inflation-astrophysics-a8262611.html) which outlived him before it could be published.

It raises questions as to Satoshi's envisaging of peer to peer? Was he describing a relationship of participants on a network that can't be described by rectilinear? 

Was his version of *cash* a post-commerce system set in a Quantum environment?

Is this the true qualitative difference between bitcoin and fiat issuance? That until this is understood; bitcoin can't become the dollar trap we sub consciously understand it to be?

- 1 more ordoid hc1 with 1TB mechnical HDD which i can retask - it isnt busy :)

so:

- does each LN need it's own dedicated BTC node, or can LN share BTC nodes?
- assuming yes, is there any benefit or cost (in terms of processing or, well, anything) by running, lets say, 2 sets of 5 ln rpi + 1 hc1 btc node setup? thinking of classic app server/db server structure
- additional: are rpi zeros any good for LN? i've got 6 currently untasked ....

any feedback appreciated :)",1521586089,20/03/2018 22:48:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85x6rf/multiple_ln_nodes_connecting_to_a_single_btc_full/,14

How to explain what Blockchain is?,"So what's blockchain? what is so revolutionary about it?
Blockchain is described as a distributed data storage network, a node to node transferring and authentication structure and an innovative application of advanced IT technologies such as encryption algorithm. Not clear? in other terms, is a distributed public ledger and an upgraded version of a distributed database. Why is it distributed? because is not centralized in one location or computer but on a vast majority of devices using the technology… good luck trying to hack that.
Nowadays, each company, organization, and bank keep their own ledgers separately, while sometimes it may be difficult to trust those ledgers. In order to check its credibility, a lot of neutral third parties will be introduced. This extra layer of overlooking brings huge costs not just financially, but on communication levels too. Whereas blockchain keeps a record of all matters on the same digital ledger and each party involved has an exact copy at hand, reducing human and financial recourses. What's the biggest value of it? trust.",1521595299,21/03/2018 01:21:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ya8p/how_to_explain_what_blockchain_is/,7

I'm writing my undergrad thesis on Bitcoin and would love any input you guys have for me. (Outline in comments) (Crosspost /r/CryptoCurrency),"Hey guys.

I'm in my senior year of my undergrad for economics and I chose to write my thesis on cryptocurrency. Originally I wanted to have a really wide scope and determine if any cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC were the 3 I was going to focus on) would become widespread/global currencies. However, my professor correctly pointed out that that was a very wide scope and I needed to narrow down my focus. 

Essentially, my aim is to analyze how the costs and payoffs of mining Bitcoin affect the supply, and how that could possibly affect to Bitcoin becoming a widely accepted currency. I chose Bitcoin because I found the most information on it and it's the most recognizable cryptocurrency. 

Currently, I have the factors affecting supply as follows:

* Energy costs: using average of monthly residential and commercial rates of electricity in the US (I'm using the average of the two)

* Reward/payoff for mining: fees per block? (I'm not sure if I should use daily fees from [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html) or something from [here](https://blockchain.info/charts) or total transaction [fees](https://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees))

* Rate of mining: average capacity of high end GPUs (measured in hash rate). Please correct me if this is CPUs. I'm also debating whether to include ASICs in this or if that would be too much. 

* Cost of GPUs: average price of aforementioned GPUs (Again, correct me if this is CPUs, I'm not a miner and this is the first real research I've done on this)

* Energy use: Per day, running 24 hrs/day, given a constant average hash rate

* If I can find a way to incorporate Moore's Law into the analysis, I will.

All of this will be measured how it affects the supply (Block rate). This will be done through regression. I'll also discuss the limited supply and what could potentially happen once mining stops. 

I aim to conclude with some predictions and discussion of other factors that influence adoption of cryptocurrency (i.e government regulation/opposition, technological limitations, interactions with the banking system, more if I have time.)

Please correct me if you see any flaws in my outline. Thanks for taking the time to read through this, I love this community and really believe that crypto can have real benefits besides simple investing and is here to stay.",1521604982,21/03/2018 04:03:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85za77/im_writing_my_undergrad_thesis_on_bitcoin_and/,4

Bitcoin and Evolutionary Biology,"Bitcoin is compatible with principles in evolutionary biology. The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins provides summarized insight as to why the game theory mechanisms in Bitcoin appeal to evidence-based biologic principles. One key concept is that over the course of human evolution (and other species for that matter), we have established an ESS (Evolutionary Stable Strategy), which favours the behaviour of ""generally cooperate, and if wronged, retaliate."" The behaviour is in dynamic equilibrium with other behaviour types, and a species does not survive if there are critical amounts of ""cheaters"" in the system. This concept dispels arguments such as, ""____ will fail because it is human nature to exploit/kill/impede others,"" because it is not. This is game theory (reiterated prisoner's dilemma) applied to evolutionary biology. Distributed consensus DOES work, and it works towards the majority's best interests. The idea is further reinforced in the field of behavioural economics, where they explore the innate nature of the social contract. Check out Dan Ariely - ""Predictably Irrational.""

Another important concept is with regards to altruistic behaviour, and how apparent altruism is driven by seflish motives to perpetuate an individual's genes. There is no true altruism in biology, but rather an innate understanding of helping others for the sake of optimizing our own best interests. This concept consolidates the idea of why an incentivized Proof of Work system really is the best mechanism to expand the network effect and security for Bitcoin. The incentives are aligned with human nature.",1521610458,21/03/2018 05:34:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85zr2m/bitcoin_and_evolutionary_biology/,20

Do you think that maybe it could see a condensing of price?

Thirty days of bitcoin: rebound to re dive,"In December 2017, after a low or low tide, the price of bitcoin went straight to twenty thousand dollars, after which analysts said that the price of bitcoin will break through the 100 thousand dollar mark in 2018. The spread of social networks, coupled with media coverage, made more people on the ship. The first lesson of these people is to learn to adapt to the ""moody"" of bitcoin.

At the beginning of the middle of the month, the price of bitcoin fluctuated up and down at $ten thousand, up to $14000 at a maximum, and at the lowest point of $6000. According to the AEX data of well-known exchanges, the price of bitcoin is about 8508 dollars in the evening of March 20th, which has increased to 2.1% in the past 24 hours, and over the past week, it has fallen by more than 7.87%.

And two weeks ago, the price of bitcoin was 11687 dollars. In terms of the trend, bitcoin's performance in March and February is the opposite. In February, it fell first and then went up in March, and then in March. In March 15th, the market value of virtual currency has shrunk by 60 billion US dollars in the past 24 hours, due to the decline of the main virtual currencies such as bitcoin and Ethernet.",1521616551,21/03/2018 07:15:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8607i8/thirty_days_of_bitcoin_rebound_to_re_dive/,0

Say Yes/No
or True/False , that above statement have the potential.


If some one asked same question 3 months ago,on December,I am sure, 95%+ would say , Hell yes! 
But right now market has a sentiment ,so lets see what do you think.


But still I am suggesting, those who have BTC already , don't buy right now, be patient , wait till the end of 1st week of April.You can only consider to buy , if you do not have any Crypto.

Apartment building caught fire - friendly reminder to make BACKUPS of your keys/seeds!,"This happened a few days ago, I was working from home since I had a doctor's appointment later in the day. There's construction work going on on the exterior of my building so to drown out the noise I had my headphones on, listening to music. 

I smell smoke, the kind of smoky campfire smell, took the headphones off and could hear a slight crackle of wood on fire, went to the balcony door and got the attention of one of the workers who then realized that there was a fire in the wood beams underneath the roof tiles - the worker guys tried to put out the fire using buckets of water, no success, I stuck my head out the window and saw thick smoke coming out from cracks around the window and underneath the roof tiles (my apartment is on the top floor).

The workers started evacuating everyone in the building, I took what felt like an eternity but might just have been a minute or two, to grab my laptop, my external hard-drive, my passport and my paper wallets and ran down to the street. Could see lots of smoke coming from the roof, saw the firefighters arrive, climb up the scaffolding and start to smash the roof tiles off and spray water everywhere.

Around 3 hours later I'm back in my apartment, one of the rooms where my computers and mining equipment (small rig with 3xGPU) sits, has been heavily water damaged and the wood around the window has been burnt and smashed. The rest of the apartment is in better shape, mostly smoke and soot damage.

I don't hold a life changing amount of money in BTC (+alts), but still enough that it would really suck to have it go up in flames. I always had a plan to make backups and store them in a different physical location, but never got around to it. Luckily the fire was caught early on and no-one was hurt, my paper wallets would probably also have made it through OK (except for water damage) if I hadn't had the time to grab them. But I can't shake the feeling of the pure dumb fucking luck of being home and the fire being spotted early. It's been a bit chaotic with insurance people and stuff the last few days, but I made (password protected) backups of my wallets and have them in three different locations now.

**TL;DR**: Apartment building caught on fire, only by pure luck was I home and could grab my paper wallets before leaving. BACK UP YOUR WALLETS / SEEDS!",1521626704,21/03/2018 10:05:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/860x9h/apartment_building_caught_fire_friendly_reminder/,99

Bitcoin is a sponge that can soak up an infinite amount of value,"For anyone who considers the bull run of 2017 and subsuquent crash of early 2018 to be out of the ordinary, that's because Bitcoin isn't ordinary. Nothing like this has every existed before. As a method of value transfer first and foremost, with adoption growing, there is no limit to how high the value of Bitcoin may go. 
Fiat money is inflationary with a hard floor value of 0 that it is slowly but surely trending towards, and designed to do so.
 Bitcoin on the other hand, is deflationary by design and has no hard ceiling value, it can and will continue to grow in value infinitely.

You might be shocked by the results if you're like me.","After hearing time and time again from random sources that capital gains tax is around 10%, I was quite surprised to learn that short term capital gains is taxable at your highest rate - 33% in my case.

Not only that, but because bitcoin was valuated at 14k at the end of December which is around the time that I made my last trade, my 2017 tax bill is quite high.  

Just a suggestion to do your taxes before the deadline in case you're like me and need to liquidate some of your remaining holdings to foot that bill.  

If your exchange furnished a 1099K, you can be assured that the federal government knows about your activity.  At the end of the day, the penalties for tax fraud and evasion are far more than the bill, so don't do something dumb.",1521637056,21/03/2018 12:57:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/861uuc/psa_if_you_havent_done_your_taxes_yet_get_to_it/,41

UK banks close accounts down for bitcoin trading,"Hi there,

I just wanted to share my experience of trading bitcoin in the UK for the last 4 years. I've always used localbitcoins due to its simplicity for GBP to BTC (and vice versa) and low fees. However I've gone through 4 bank accounts during my time trading with each one stating that they'll shut down my account if I carried on. The banks I've used are Halifax, Lloyds, Monzo and Starling. I seemed to have the most success with Monzo until today.

Does anyone know why banks in the UK have a problem with this? Have people had similar experiences? Also does anyone know of any banks that would support such activity as I'm running out of options?

It would be much appreciated if people could share who they bank with while trading cryptocurrencies.

Thanks!

TLDR: Have had 4 UK bank warnings of closure if I don't stop trading bitcoin. What bank would be best to use for trading bitcoin and other cryptos without risk of closure to the account?

The negative bias in bitcoin reports,"About every single article I read about bitcoin contains this statement “since its peak in late December bitcoin has lost half of its value”. 
I still have to find an article that states “ In the last 4 months (from mid November where it was at $6k) bitcoin value has risen by 50%, even counting the post-peak drop, and that 50% rise is on the heels of another 600% rise since early 2017 (when it was at $1k).

Buying bitcoins without risk of losing money,"https://www.hibenjamin.com/blog/buy-bitcoins-without-risk-losing-money-guide-responsible-investing/

The basic idea is that you use some of your money to buy a bond so as to return your original investment over a specified number of years. Then you take the money that isn't invested in bonds and buy bitcoin. I think the math works out so that the more highly levered the investment in bitcoin the better. Is this a good/bad idea? Has anyone tried doing something like this?

The advanced section says that call options on bitcoin are not available, but I did some cursory research and deribit offers bitcoin options. Does anyone have any experience opening an account with them?

Possible solution to this issue about objectionable content in the blockchain,"Correct me if I’m wrong but couldn’t we do something like  a soft-fork? Where transactions are done that disallow this feature of embedding data on to a transaction. Or perhaps increasing the fee for the transaction to a point where it disincentivizes anyone from adding content to a transaction in the future.

Regarding miners and nodes and downloading the whole blockchain: this would require the arduous process of a hard fork where future miners would have to download an encoded patch that permanently locks the previous blockchain from decryption. That way all of that objectionable content becomes useless. 

With future transactions, incentivize those that keep it as purely transactions without additional data attachments. 

Those with data attached would have to wait through longer confirmation process where miners determine whether it has objectionable data or not. This doesn’t require a human acting as a judge. This is where AI could be introduced into the mining process, where the AI looks for this sort of thing and eliminates it or denies the transaction from going through. In addition to being more costly to send transactions with data attached, the AI serves as an impartial filter. Point is.... it creates more of an incentive to execute clean transactions instead of ones with additional data. 

Idk. Anyone care to bash me where I’m wrong? 

Edit:

From the study, this part stuck out:

The utilization of chameleon hash functions [15] to chain blocks recently opened up a potential approach to mitigate unwanted or illegal blockchain con- tent [11]. Here, a single blockchain maintainer or a small group of maintainers can retrospectively revert single transactions, e.g., due to illegal content. To overcome arising trust issues, μchain [51] leverages the consensus approach of traditional blockchains to vote on alterations of the blockchain history. As these approaches tackle unwanted content for newly designed blockchains, we seek to motivate a discussion on countermeasures also for existing systems, e.g., Bitcoin.

"The one and only reason why you might prefer blockchain technology over normal databases is: Someone has the Motive and Ability to change your data, and you would like to prevent him from doing so","If the statement above doesn't apply to your situation (which it doesn't, for 90% of the blockchain projects) than you're good enough with a regular database.

Explanation: We always hear that blockchain has many advantages. Decentralized. Distributed. Immutable.

All these advantages can be reduced to a single core advantage. Blockchain data can't be modified/changed/deleted by any person/cooperation/government in the world. You can put [child pornography](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/20/child-abuse-imagery-bitcoin-blockchain-illegal-content) inside your blockchain and all the governments in the world combined won't have the ability to remove that content.

Blockchain can't be changed, can't be modified, can't be deleted. It's forever.

That's the core advantage of blockchain technology.

The only reason why you would need something that is unchangeable forever is if some other entity (person/government) has the Motive and (not less important) the Ability to change that data.

If you checkout all the existing uses of blockchain, you can see in all of them that there is obviously a will and ability of some entities to change the data. Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, Voting, Identification. All of the current major uses of blockchain technology clearly have an entity with a Motive and Ability which is prevented thanks to blockchain technology.

So before you go and start a new blockchain project, please ask yourself if someone has the Motive and Ability to change your data. If not, don't use the slow, inefficient, complicated database called blockchain.",1521657272,21/03/2018 18:34:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/864jed/the_one_and_only_reason_why_you_might_prefer/,50

Transactions with zero transaction fees are included while the mempool is full of transactions with non-zero ty fees.

r/CryptoCurrency just recently added a few new rules which I think are fundamentally sound. I'd like to make the suggestion that r/Bitcoin ought to do the same.,"The new rule changes for /r/CryptoCurrency can be found [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/85ow78/three_new_rule_changes_on_rcryptocurrency/).

I think the /r/Bitcoin community has been due something similar for a while now. Vegeta and roller coaster memes are all good fun, but it seems as though a lot of important topics are often left in the dust in favor of this type of pseudo-relevant content. Of course, I'm not suggesting that comedy and media content such as this should be blatantly forbidden or ridiculed without purpose, however, I think that in order to provide this community with a better opportunity for learning, this content should be contained within and limited to its own segmented community. The moderators in the thread linked at the top of this comment have suggested that users utilize the [/r/Cryptocurrencymemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrencymemes/) subreddit for those interested in this type of content, which I think is a fair and level-headed compromise. I am proposing that the /r/Bitcoin community adopt and enforce its own version of these rules in the above link, in order to achieve a similar goal, that is, a community where people are again able to engage in respectful and thoughtful discussion of the technologies in question. Users shouldn't be forced to migrate to other communities in order to constructively debate the philosophies and theories of this budding new technology. By adopting these new changes, we don't necessarily have to abandon the most exuberant aspects of this community which many are obviously so fond of. We can still talk lambos, power levels, and natural satellites, but if we can agree to keep this sort of content within its appropriate communities, I believe that this community will benefit greatly as a result. When it comes to Bitcoin, there is a lot of progress being made every day which more often than not, goes unnoticed. With lots of misinformation being spread as well (both the intentional and non-intentional), staying accurately informed in an industry that moves regularly at break-neck speeds is hard enough as it is. Having to sieve through all of this other content only makes it more difficult for the average user to stay informed, and of course, education is the premise of progress, in any community. If we aim to truly make great changes outside of our community, we must first aim to make great changes from within. As time goes on, communities evolve. Adaptation is the only constant, whether it be realized or not. But if we can develop a community where introspection is the norm, then we can at least attempt to evolve in the most positive way we can, together.

Anyways, its just a suggestion. If anyone has one of their own and wants to share, I'd be happy to listen.",1521663923,21/03/2018 20:25:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/865hrn/rcryptocurrency_just_recently_added_a_few_new/,21

Teacher shut down our Miner because of child porn allegations. What should we do?,"We go to a technical high school and my friends and I are in the IT shop so with spare parts we put together a bitcoin miner. Pretty janky setup with two motherboards and a graphics card powered by two psus.

Anyway we go in today and my Teacher shut off the machine and told us “No more Bitcoin Mining. I read that there is child pornography in the block chain and you must mine a different crypto from here on out”

Honestly it doesn’t surprise me that he did this as he is very “PC” and under different circumstances, we’d just start mining dogecoin. 

Thing is, mining bitcoin is supposed to be my friends Senior Project and he has already written two drafts of a ten page research paper on bitcoin. Now my teacher thinks this is unacceptable and he must scrap the project. 

What can we do to show him how ridiculous this is?

EDIT: My teacher is very persistent once he makes a decision, and I fear if we try to talk to him he will tell us we are “disrespecting his authority”.

Is bitcoin a crime in Egypt?,"Egypt has became one of those countries where crypto-community members are now obliged to live under the double pressure of ambiguous political statements and significant legal uncertainty.

On the one side, the heads of two major local financial regulatory institutions - the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA) - have already publicly expressed their disapproval of digital money: one saying that non of local entities is allowed to trade crypto-currencies, while other rejecting the legality of crypto-transactions. It goes even further than that. Egyptian religious authorities have also found it necessary to join into this heated conversation by issuing the fatwa, which declares crypto-trading to be non-compatible with the Sharia law.

On the other side, officially, there has not yet been issued any piece of regulation, which may explicitly make crypto illegal in Egypt. However, with so much of political muscles applied to the one side of this scale, there's now a little doubt left that the long-term future of crypto-currencies in Egypt is under serious threat.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: indifferent;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: multiple;
major limitations: slow GDP growth, multiple administrative and legal barriers to SME, more than half the population is living under the poverty line, slowly growing fixed Internet penetration rate (currently at thirty percents, growing three percents yearly), brain-drainage;
stimulus: well diversified economy, closeness to MENA and EU markets, educated workforce, fast growing generation of young mobile Internet users;
opportunities: to create a variety of mobile applications aimed at young consumers living in urban areas.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal status is not defined (negative).

Life with Schizophrenia &amp; Bitcoin,"I know that this subject is not really about Bitcoin but I feel like I have to share this somewhere.

I've grown up with a father who's fallen subject for one of the worst mental illnesses there is.. Schizophrenia.

He believes all the common stuff that schizophrenics believe in ie; CIA is spying on him, aliens have captured him earlier in his life, he has a microchip in his brain, his water is poisoned and he's been summoned by god. (The latter isn't all too crazy but you get the picture.) The fact that he hasn't gotten anywhere with his life at the age of 54 saddens me immensely.

He recently told me his friend tried to OD him with heroin and I think that was his call for help. I've tried to mentally prepare myself but I've been procrastinating for several months now. I have to start somewhere so I need to talk about it. I have some experience with caretaking since I've worked as a mental health caregiver for almost 2 years but I was barely qualified, I came fresh out of college. (Got educated in the workplace.)

I quit a couple of months ago when I fell to the realization that my own father has schizophrenia. My mother and my grandparents has been telling me since childhood that he's just a drug addict and I went on with my life with that image but I've come to realize they're all wrong.

So with how things are I cannot continue my life without dedicating mine to him. I am going to give this a 100% shot at me taking care of him 24/7 for as long as it takes and if I can't get him back on track to life then I really hope I can move on without him.

I've watched every single Andreas Antonopoulus video and I've done as much research as my brain have been able to process and it is my only shot at being able to keep up with my own life.

I know this is somewhat risky but I don't feel like I have much other choice.

I also know I'm not the only one out there in a similar situation so if you're reading this you can always message me if you need someone to talk to. I would love to hear your stories.

And to those who just want to get rich, remember that life is short and family &amp; friends arn't around forever.

I wish you all the very best, fellow Bitcoiners.",1521685223,22/03/2018 02:20:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8684r2/life_with_schizophrenia_bitcoin/,3

Holding Workshops to teach people about Bitcoin. Help me refine the content.,"Hi everyone,

**TL;DR** Financial industry crypto enthusiast guy wants to give 2 hour talk. Need help to prioritize the content (go directly to third subheading **Content**)

**About me:**

I have been in the field for almost a year now. Started mining last summer. Had bought my first Bitcoin three years ago. I used to work in Investment Management firm, I quit last month. I started my own firm Patil Capital LLC, for my own investments in Crypto. I plan to accept other people's money later but for now will hold 2 hour workshops to educate people about Bitcoin and Blockchain. I will be charging small amount ($20-$30) to cover the Hotel Conference Room Rent and then some. 

I don't think I am some expert in Bitcoin. Many anonymous people here know more. I just think, I know enough to explain other people factually, so they can start their journey in this Crypto rabbit hole. Many people here know far more than me, and some would be better speakers as well. I want to create a template (open source), anyone can use this material and hold their own workshops. Crypto Education is a long journey and this would be useful until every last person in the world has bought Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is community driven project, after working for a month I thought I should get community feedback as well. Your feedback in any shape or form is appreciated. Thank you.

**Why this Workshop?**

I have learned everything in this field by reading on reddit and watching youtube videos of the likes Jackson Palmer and Andreas Antonopoulos for 1000s of hours. And then lot if content is not neutral and is full of hyperbole. In my experience  general people who still don't know much of Bitcoin are turned off by huge price projections and big claims. What I want to provide them is the factual information of how it works and what is possible today without the hype. Then why not youtube video you ask? One. I want to give this message on a different platform where other low quality content is abundant. Two. My video editing skills are not my forte. Already struggling working on my wordpress site. Three. I want to do this full time. Monetising youtube videos is form my knowledge would take a lot of time. Four. Want to provide someone who wants condensed quality information for a price. Most people have attended Hotel workshop/seminars.

**Content**

This workshop is targeted towards complete beginner who just has heard Bitcoin from coworkers, family, friends or in the news and never bought any. I want to provide information which is neutral, without any Hype/hyperbole. Provide working of Blockchain in some detail, which assures them there is robust open source infrastructure to make this possible. But not as much they they get turned off and don't understand. And I also want to include things that they can do with this information, like go and buy Bitcoin on Coinbase, research more with tools like Coinmarketcap etc., install desktop wallets like exodus or Jaxx or something else. As you can imagine this is a delicate dance of not throwing allot information and giving enough that they know what and where to look for. In future I may design another workshop with more advanced stuff. 

**Formatting of the content**:

I am mentioning time to be spent on **each topic**. Words without formatting would be said as they appear. *Italics part* is what I am communicating with you here, about what I feel.


**Total time 100 mins (accounting for 5 min break, 10 min QnA and some margin)**

**Part 1: Introduction** (50 mins)

**Decentralized Peer to Peer Digital Currency** (15 mins)

Explain meaning of each term. What you can do with it is – Send cross border payments, take anonymous charity donations, censorship resistant peer to peer financial transactions. No government, company, institution controls, monitors this. That also means you cannot go to anyone if anything goes wrong. (Maybe your wallet provider or exchange - but their authority/power is limited to their internal matters). Users are Global, anyone with smart phone and internet connection can use it. 

*Here I would make clear that whatever I feel about these things, Genie is out of the bottle. So only thing we can do is to learn about. After this you may buy it, not buy it, protest it whatever. But first we need to learn. This will set the base of discussion and tone of the session.* 

**How Bitcoin Works?** (10 mins)

Network of computers, where you transmit transactions. Miners and nodes verify validity i.e. correct addresses, balance in sending account is more than or equal to amount transferred. I will heave the diagram of network. And will show that there is no single point of failure like Centralized systems. Attacker needs to acquire more than 51% which is prohibitively expensive.    

**Cryptographic Functions** (10 mins)

Why this works? One way transactions like John Oliver’s show mentioned Chicken to Chicken McNuggets. I want to tie this to the public and private keys, how signing the transactions work. 

**Blockchain** (10 mins)

Always current and immutable. *Explain why it is interest of miners to update the blockchain when some some other miner has found the block.* Its is consensus that has valuable. *What is meant by number of verification, why more is better.*

**Miners** (5 mins) 
Miner's mine blocks and get rewarded in Bitcoin. Miners are needed in the system to make it decentralized. Anyone can *Include explanation why only 21 Million coins*

**Break** (10 mins)

**Part 2: Today, After 9 Years** (50 mins) 

**What can you buy with Bitcoin** (5 mins)

*I have a slide with logos of companies that accept Bitcoin* Following companies accept Bitcoin 
Overstock, Dish, Cheapair, Fidelity Charitable, okcupid, Expedia, JMBullion, Newegg, Playstation Network, New York Preschool etc. At the checkout retailer would provide their public address and the amount in Bitcoins based on exchange rate at that time. You would go to wallet (or exchange and send that amount to that address). 

Even though this is possible many Bitcoin holders will not do it. Challenges? Why? *ties to the next topic*

**Store of Value vs Medium of Transaction Argument** (5 mins)
Bitcoin is not only used as currency but also as Digital Gold. *Explain why it has characteristics of a very good Store of Value* 

**Open Source Nature**  (10 mins)
Bitcoin is software and unlike facebook and Amazon it is publically available. So anyone can see and also copy. Benefits of open source projects are that they are developed by voluntary contribution so capital is spent. Bugs are found quickly. Value is accrued because of ""network effect"" and not the secret ownership of some code. Network effect like with Facebook, more people use it more the value is. So copying software does not copy people that use it. That is what a fork is. 

**Other Cryptocurrencies** (10 mins)
So many people indeed copied the projects. Changed the parameters, algorithms, total number etc. Some solve some issue but many have been outright cash grabs. When fork happens you get same amount of new coins. You may call it free coins, but needs some work for claiming. That is only possible as long as you hold the private keys. If you hold coins them on exchange then you are their mercy. 

**Online Culture** (5 mins)
Because this is open source, digital currency discussion, arguments everything happens online - Bitcointalk.org, Reddit, Youtube videos and Facebook groups. Terms like HODL, MOON, REKT.

**Things people are working on** (5 mins)
Currency is first application of Blockchain. People are working on banking, land records, voting etc. ALso trying to reduce the pain currently we face in using such as Lightning Network. *Explain few more things. Please suggest more*

**Question and Answer** (10 mins)

**Want to include these topics, but can't fit them due to time constraint**

**Desktop Wallets vs Exchange**

You can buy Bitcoins from a person by paying him cash but most people buy it on Exchange. ALthough Exchanges are necessary to buy Bitcoins, they are not part of Bitcoin. And they compromise some features of Bitcoin itself such as identity, centralization, and importantly private key ownership. 
Only way to hold your private keys 


**Topics Intentionally left**

* Bitcoin Whitepaper - too technical
* Identity and speculations of Satoshi Nakamoto. 
* What Smart Contract Platforms are and what they doo. Too technical.
* Legality and tax stuff - Important but nothing concrete available. It is a still being worked out. 
* Commodity/Property, Security vs Utility token
* Scaling Debate: Too technical

Summarized:

-**Energy is being wasted**

Clearly, Bitcoin is useful to some people. Judgements about whether or not something is wasted is best left to those using it. We don't end up with a good society if we start deciding for other people what is useful and what is not. 

To people who value censorship-resistance, neutrality, global access, completely decentralised system of currency with no geopolitical attachments, Bitcoin is a very useful application. Some would argue it is the most useful application in the 21^st century.

You can't do the security of Bitcoin without the investment in energy. To those who say you can, they are saying that you can get something of value out of nothing. There's a reason why the security of reason costs that much in terms of energy; if you do it for less, it's less secure. If it's less secure, you won't have a valuable network.

The energy in Bitcoin is not wasted - it's *used* to make the network secure without central authority. No one has demonstrated at scale an alternative.

-**What about Proof of Stake?**

There is a lot of complexity in using an intrinsic currency as stake for the security of the same currency. The game theory gets very complicated. Proof of Work is straightforward: you spend resources on energy in order to secure the virtual asset. If you decide to fuck it up, not only do you lose the value of the virtual asset, but you also spent money on energy that you are not going to get back. This creates a level of grounding. 

This is the primary basis on which Bitcoin achieves immutability; the idea that it is as computationally expensive to re-write the ledger for 3 days as the amount of energy you spent to write the ledger the first time for 3 days. It is one of the security guarantees that Bitcoin has - in order to re-write the ledger, you have to expend the energy again, but you receive the reward once. This makes it very very expensive to re-write even small stretches of the ledger. We do not know of a better basis for immutability that doesn't use energy, and I would challenge anyone who claims that there is.

-**The Nirvana fallacy - comparing Bitcoin to something perfect**

If this world produced all energy from renewable resources, and all energy is used for useful things, then perhaps we may look at Bitcoin and ask whether or not the value of Bitcoin is commensurate to the energy we are using. None of the journalists did even a cursory examination of what energy is being used for today. 

Let me give you just 3 examples: Bitcoin's energy use is *one hundreth* of the energy used in mining gold. Gold is integral to the monetary system that Bitcoin is directly trying to replace. There are also environmental costs of mining gold - from sulphuric acid leeching into rivers, denuding hills, destroying mountains, etc. A tiny fraction is being used for industrial use, the vast majority of gold is being held as store of value.

Let's take a look at things like Christmas lights. The entire electricity use of Bitcoin in a year pales in comparison to the 1 week of electricity being used to power Christmas lights in the US alone. There are additional effects such as light pollution, and the majority does not come from renewable resources. You can argue about the pointlessness of such tradition.

More practically, every charging device with a step-down converter sits plugged in and coverts electricity to heat. The estimated power this consumes is *2 orders of magnitudes* greater than what Bitcoin consumes. This is a worldwide phenomenon which is an enormous drain of energy. Cherry on top: the world's largest polluters and energy spenders are military; the main purpose they serve is to kill people.

We haven't even discussed the amount of energy required to support the existing banking system.

-**Journalistic dishonesty and sensationalism**

Spare me the righteous indignation of the environmental impact and waste of energy of cryptocurrencies - it is unscientific and completely hypocritical. All of the journalistic analysis goes like this: if it takes X kilowatts to conduct 1 transaction, and we took it to world scale, how much energy would that cost? They disregard that the energy used is completely unrelated to the # of transactions. The equivalent flawed thinking would be, ""if this pregnant lady's belly is THIS large at 3 months, then in 5 years, it will be as big as this entire room."" That is the exact scientific value of extrapolating something on a variable that is not dependent.

-**How are you sure of your numbers?**

We can estimate the lower bound of energy consumption, and say that it is unlikely that the real number is twice as much as the lower bound. The energy requirement to do a hash is a fundamental thermodynamic law. You're flipping bits, and they take a certain amount of energy to flip. You know the computational energy efficiency of 16nm ASIC-based chips. If you assume the network operates on this (which is incorrect, but again, lower bound estimate), and we know exactly how many hashes/sec are being calculated, because that's recorded on the blockchain, then we can calculate exactly how many joules of energy it takes. If you assume 50% of miners have 1 generation of miners behind (unlikely, because miners require optimisation), then it is at most 1.5x the lower bound of energy consumption.

It is easy to estimate the amount of energy being used in Bitcoin, which makes it an easy target. When you use your VISA card, you do not see the 600,000 employees who commute to work using gasoline-burning cars, the 26-story buildings which are lit 24 hours a day, data centers which are doing fraud prevention and analytics, as well as selling data to intelligence agencies and advertisers. All of this costs a lot of money and energy, and arguably just as ""wasteful,"" but it's a hidden cost.

My thought of Bitcoin's value. Should it appreciate faster than Gold?,"I think we tend to overvalue its use as an apocalyptic hedge. How often do these events happen to what percent is in our investment portfolio?

Like Gold, both have a limited supply and will deflate. And with how little of it there is in the world, 6.1 billion ounces roughly, there is still plenty to buy. 

I can only find a 100 year graph of gold and % increase per year on average isn't great.  My assumption for this is because people would rather put most of their money into the stock market for higher risk and better returns. 

For Bitcoin, barring the price being influenced subjectively because of hype, FUD, manipulation, etc. I can't see why it would be any different. My point is, using Bitcoin ONLY as a vehicle to hedge against another currencies value doesn't seem like a good investment.  

Bitcoins use for easy P2P transactions is where most of its value comes from in my opinion. However, I don't know if I can see it become main stream enough for the majority of people to put more than 10% of their money in it.

What are your thoughts?

Brief explainer for beginners: the different implementations of the Lightning Network (and what does it mean it's in beta?),"**TL;DR:** *there are three different implementations of the Lightning Network. Only one of them reached mainnet beta phase, the others are still pre-beta. It will take some (unknown) time until first user-friendly wallets and applications will be available on the mainnet*

There have been lots of news lately regarding the Lightning Network “going live” or coming into the beta phase. This is a very simplified description of what is actually happening and I want to briefly explain the current state of things in a simple way.  

The Lightning Network is a so-called “second layer” protocol, operating on top of Bitcoin blockchain.  

Like [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) is one of the existing implementations of the Bitcoin protocol, there are three implementations of the Lightning protocol: **c-lightning**, **Eclair** and **LND**. All three are following the [BOLT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc) (Basis Of Lightning Technology) standard, which makes them fully compatible with each other.  

* Of these three implementations, one recently reached the beta phase on the mainnet: **[LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd)**. This is a software that is being built by a group including Elizabeth Stark and Laolu Osuntokun (roasbeef). Beta phase means, that the code for the mainnet version has been released on their Github page and the developers are confident that there are no critical bugs. It doesn’t mean that the current version is user-friendly, guaranteed to be stable or without bugs completely. The release doesn't target the average user yet, it is still mostly for developers and people who are willing to read through long documentation files (although there are beginner-friendly step-by-step guides describing how to build a Lightning node from scratch, such as [this one](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/raspibolt)).

The other two implementations are currently still in the pre-beta phase, but presumably will be in beta soon(tm) as well:  

* **[Eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair)** has a neat Android wallet on the testnet, which is the most user-friendly application that I’ve seen on Lightning yet. Make sure to [check it out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.eclair.wallet) if you are interested to try Lightning but don’t want to spend time typing command lines.  


* The **[c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning)** team includes names like Christian Decker and Rusty Russel. I am not very familiar with this implementation yet, but I am sure the brilliant people behind that one are building something epic, too.  


Apart from that, there are developers building their own versions of a lightning wallet, like Jack Mallers ([Zap wallet](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop), available for MacOs, Windows and Linux) or Anton Kumaigorodsky ([Lightning Wallet](http://lightning-wallet.com) for Android). Their wallets use one of the three implementations as the basis for their software. Zap is built on LND and Lightning Wallet uses the Eclair implementation.  


As we can see, the Lightning Network is not a single, monolithic piece of software that you can just switch from testnet to mainnet, or from alpha to beta. It’s a constant work-in-progress with different groups of developers, and the releases (as well as adoption) will happen in a gradual process. As Jameson Lopp put it so eloquently:  

&gt;Q: When will the Lightning Network be rolled out?  
&gt;A: The rollout has already begun. This is an iterative distributed learning process; it’s unlikely there will be a single point in time at which we say LN is “deployed” because it will grow organically. Software is never finished.

BREAKING: there is a pornographic image hidden in the mathematical constant Pi! Call your representative and demand a ban!,"I present you a filthy image of a scientist and a journalist having a doggy-style sex:

     ■□□□□□□
     ■□□■■■■
     ■■□■□■□
     ■□■■□■□

You can encode the image above as 1000000100111111010101011010 in binary, which is 135525722 in decimal.

If you check the decimal sequence using a Pi search engine (for example, on subidiom), you'll find that it appears at the 742,824,792nd decimal digit of Pi.

So, yes, there is a pornographic image hidden in Pi! 

Theoretically, you can even find a full-length HD movie in Pi (but you need to know where to search).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, how it’s related to Bitcoin?

If you’ve missed it, there is currently a new FUD wave about porno hidden in the Bitcoin blockchain. Hundreds of media outlets are reporting about it, including the Telegraph. 

The idiots don’t understand that you can find porn anywhere, in every single piece of random data - if you search long enough, and use the right encoding.  ",1521723305,22/03/2018 12:55:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86b9tn/breaking_there_is_a_pornographic_image_hidden_in/,866

Mainnet Lightning Network Statistics,"I ran some statistics against my node (LND .4), which is connected to the mainnet network, and this is what my node sees.  The attempt here is track the general growth of the network from a node's point of view and how the capacity of nodes and channels changes over time.  I hope to get this data running automatically into a database, but for now it just spits out text.

Maybe people are frequently using bitcoin to buy and sell and I'm missing it, but i feel as if people are using it as a way to invest. 

I like the idea of bitcoin as a currency that is not controlled by a corrupt authority. But I just don't think it is an actual ""currency"" right now.

Btcd and docker (and synology diskstation in my case) up and running in 5 minutes,"I’ve been meaning to set up a full node and have had a few false starts, but last night I decided to check out how to do it with docker. I know very little about docker but I know my NAS, a Synology Diskstation with an Intel atom processor has it.

So I opened docker on it, searched for btcd and got the roasbeef/btcd image and a few minutes later it was installed and synchronizing.

I have no idea if it is a full node or a listening node. Actually I think listening since I don’t seem to have a lot of upload and I haven’t opened any ports. But it’s a start. 

I looked for Lightning but didn’t find an image that I liked but that’s sure to come at some point. For lightning though one must be more careful since there is real money at stake so I’d spend more time making sure it is a legit official release. 

So, if you have docker and want to run a node this was super easy. ",1521736071,22/03/2018 16:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86ctn0/btcd_and_docker_and_synology_diskstation_in_my/,0

HODL for sure... but spend every chance you get.,"The HODL mentality is great, the way the community has embraced it, and explained it to others has likely saved many inexperienced investors from selling at a loss when things have seemed rough. 

We need to remember though that at the end of the day bitcoin is a currency, and if we ever want it to reach its full potential, we need to treat it as such. 

Bitcoin is meant to be spent as much as it's meant to be saved. I urge you to download a wallet on your smart phone and treat it as your checking account for spending bitcoin. Think of your paper wallet or hardware wallet as your savings account. 

It may be hard to do. You'll fret over potentially paying what amounts to $10,000 in the future for a pizza. If we want bitcoin to succeed, it needs to be widely adopted, and as early adopters, its our obligation to help spread it. 

If you budget $300 a month for spending money, put $50 in a software wallet on your phone. When you go to the bar, restaurant, craft fair, farmers market, ask if they accept bitcoin. If they don't you'll at least plant the idea in their mind. If they do, I promise your first transaction will feel amazing (and so will the following ones too).

Warning: do NOT use Abra- it is a full blown scam,"There have been a few shill threads with botted upvotes recently about a wallet called ""Abra"" being touted as ""the next coinbase."" Do NOT sign up with these people. They are running a huge phishing operation and selling your sensitive information.

They get your name, your phone number, your social security number, your address, your bank account number, your password, then conveniently inform you after gathering all this extremely sensitive information that they will not be servicing you and will not give ANY explanation why. A legitimate exchange HAS to BY LAW disclose the reason why they are denying you service.

This is a scam application. Do NOT use Abra. Coinbase and Gemini may be far from perfect but they are popular for a reason and at least have laws regulating their actions. Abra is located in a third world country and they can take your entire stash and never be heard from again. 

And don't listen to the shills/idiots who say ""I've been using them for xxx months and have had no problems whatsoever."" Who cares? That's literally been said about every scam in history. Just because a few people do NOT get screwed does not make a scam magically legitimate.",1521751490,22/03/2018 20:44:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86ewvk/warning_do_not_use_abra_it_is_a_full_blown_scam/,0

"Coinprism shutting down on March 31st, 2018","Dear Coinprism user,


The wallet service Coinprism will be shutting down on March 31st, 2018. If you are holding funds in a Coinprism wallet, you must transfer your Bitcoins and colored coins out to another wallet and/or export your private keys before March 31st, 2018.

*Export wallet keys*

Remember that Bitcoins and colored coin funds actually reside on the Blockchain and not on Coinprism, and will continue to exist after Coinprism is shut down, however you will need your private key to access them, which is why it is critical to export it. To do this, visit this page, and after logging in, export your unencrypted keys. You can then re-import or sweep them into any Bitcoin compatible wallet such as Bitcoin Core, Coinomi or Edge. This will recover all your Bitcoins and automatically uncolor any colored coins in your wallet. If you wish to retain your colored coin assets, you must use an Open Assets compatible wallet such as Colorcore.


Best regards,

The Coinprism team",1521756722,22/03/2018 22:12:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86fkp9/coinprism_shutting_down_on_march_31st_2018/,11

Is it worth it investing tiny amounts? 5-10 Dollars?,I'm really interested in this whole cryptocurrency thingy. Its really interesting and i would really enjoy getting into. I think it would be a bit of fun! And not a big risk since i'm not mortgaging my house for it. So is it worth trying to do tiny amounts of investment.? Like putting 5 dollars into it wait and then maybe get 10 dollars out if im lucky. And ideas or suggestions? Completely new to the subject and am expanding my knowledge about crypto.

I'm just a bit confused as far as I know 0.16.0 just got released and my node shows

There are a small number of 0.16.99 nodes, but I can't find anything about it.

How taxes work,"Ok so I get the basics of taxes... buying/selling is either short or long term capital gains and mining is taxed as income then capital gain when you sell. One thing I'm not clear on is... well let me just lay out an example. Prices are made up for simplicity.

In 2015 I buy 1btc for $1000. I do not sell any. In 2016 I 1btc for $2000. I do not sell any. In 2017 I buy 1btc for $3000. Later that year I sell 1btc for $4000 out of my wallet that contains 3btc. What value would the capital gains be based off of? Would it be short or long term?

Just memorized my word seed. Took about half an hour. Feels amazing.,"I had no idea what a rush it would be to literally have my money 'in my head'. I got out the word seed I had written down months ago to test and make sure I could recover my wallet on another device.

dont do the same mistake,I remember 1year ago we had a bullish run all the way 1.3k and sudenttly the price crashed to 950 it was big a the time i saw my blockchain wallet loose hundreds of dollars I decided to hodl but out ot fear I sold immediatly after recovering. The price kept clibing up i was desperate so I bought back in and sold too early 5btc for 6400$. Since then the price kept clibing  lesson learned I justt bought back 6400$ for 2btc and hodeled Im up in profit. It seem that everynew year around this time bitcoin is underperforming and exploding around may june july etc..  another bullrun in few week month is expected. I can see bitcoin up 25k before the end of the year.

AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions,However, there are numerous branches of encrypted currency, and the process of being accepted by many users reenters the ""common sense"" category. In the early stages of development, the phenomenon of bitcoin is similar to a religious phenomenon. Under normal expectations, the encrypted currency family will undergo its own evolution and iteration, making it reasonable and practical. This means that when the more advanced stage comes, the color of worship and belief will decline, the elements of pragmatism will rise, and the advantage of ecology will become the dominant factor.AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions

Willing to work for a small amount of BTC (really small). Any advice?,"Hey guys.

I'm pretty new to investment, since financial education is basically a no thing in my country. I've always wanted to HODL some amount of BTC in my portfolio just cause. So I've waited for the right time (well, for me personally) and the right funds to start with.

Finally, I've collected enough investment fiat for 0.1 BTC. But I was carried away by exchange rate fluctuations and forgot about fees when placed my order. Now I am having a 0.09995 BTC, which is bothering me (a little bit).

Now to the question: is there some work that I can do online to get this missing 0.00005 BTC? 

Thanks in advance. Actually, thanks to this sub for helping me finally make my mind on BTC, a lot of posts here were really helpful.

Understanding block chain technology from the life cycle of a bit currency transaction,"Basic common sense:

The block chain is not equal to the bitcoin, the block chain is only the book that the bitcoin system uses to record the transaction information.
There is no account balance in bitcoin, and all transactions only record the sources and whereabouts of funds. The balance of the account is the result of the calculation in the block chain.
Mining reward is to maintain the entire system to encourage people to use their equipment is common resources to verify the validity of each transaction and reward;

The price of bitcoin has exceeded $7000 in 2017, 
AEX bitcoin trading exchange to support a variety of digital asset spot transactions，the problem is that the power consumption of bitcoin mining rose sharply. Indeed, bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy, but not so many reports, but also per watt is worth it.

Gold, diamonds, and other manufacturing power consumption is larger than the legal tender, dig bitcoin. In one study, bitcoin annual use of 0.8 to 4.4 TWH, spent annually on mining and recovery of gold on 138 terawatts, cost of the global banking system every 650 terawatt hours. Compared with these industries, bitcoin can not back this infamous tiger.

How would you implement blockchain technology into improving supply chain and e-commerce?,"There’s one thing that for a long time has been a problem in the buyer-seller relationship within the e-commerce industry, it’s the problem of processing payments. In the beginning, it had prevented reaching the fast speed in developing the online marketplace business, but for today we have a range of alternative payment methods as online wallets, gift cards, etc. But what’s important to note, though, is that while online marketplaces have been able to dramatically streamline the way retail takes place, they haven’t fundamentally changed its structure. The middleman may be much slimmer and leaner than before, but he hasn’t gone away.

So the final stage became the era of cryptocurrency that brought the revolutionary payment solutions! Bitcoin technology might once and forever remove all payment limitations in the e-commerce business. And the blockchain is able to fully cut out the middlemen and build the absolutelythe new level of transactions!

With the blockchain tech, e-commerce entrepreneurs get access to doing business in a space that is secure from interference by any of its signatories. Removed middleman provides the ability to make the payment process more efficient and expediting the time it takes to receive funds.

Hashrate Exploding ; Bitcoin Mining Driving Decentralized Energy Production,"Mining investments continue to grow at an exponential pace. The latest estimates put the global average cost to mine a Bitcoin at around $8000. As the cost to mine Bitcoins increases; the profit margins for selling newly mined coins decreases. What ends up happening is that miners start hoarding coins rather than selling. As the cost to mine Bitcoins increases 5-20% per 2weeks we can either expect the trading price of Bitcoin to increase or for less profitable mining operations to shut down.

Thus far even with the hefty declines in price; the growth of Bitcoin mines continues at an exponential pace. Since Bitcoin began to fall from its top of $20k in December the difficulty to mine Bitcoin has nearly doubled. This really just blows my mind.

**In the past 3 Months more Hashpower has been added to the Bitcoin network than all the Hashpower cumulatively added for the first 9 years of Bitcoins existence.**

Every 2 weeks the difficulty is re-adjusted to keep the average block time 10minutes apart. We've been seeing consistent 5-20% increases. The next predicted increase is only 3% on March 31st ; though usually the way hash power is added is right before the end of the cycle; that way the difficulty is not affected as much and miners can see a slightly increased profit for the next difficulty epoch.

Anyways typically what happens is when the profitability of mining increases; the price of Bitcoin goes down. Why is that?

Because a few months ago when Bitcoin was trading for $20k it only cost $4k or less to mine a Bitcoin. People realize this and decide that it makes more sense to invest in mining than in the Coin itself. So less money goes into supporting the price and more goes into securing the network via mining.

As the cost of mining normalizes with the price (price tumbles while mining costs rise exponentially) ; people that want to get involved in Crypto stop investing in mining and start investing in coin itself.

This dynamic is part of the self-bootstrapping incentive structure that theoretically helps stabilize Bitcoin within the bounds of mining costs. While it is completely possible for miners to operate at a loss; it can only be done for so long.

The opposite side of this is the so-called ""Death Spiral"" ; where the price of Bitcoins plummets far below the cost to mine ; so much so that 75%+ of the miners shut off. Since the difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks rather than based on a timestamp; 75% of miners leaving means that blocks would take 40minutes instead of 10; and that the difficulty wouldn't get adjusted downwards for 8 weeks instead of 2. This could cause more and more miners to drop out. As the miners drop out the security of the network itself decreases; which decreases confidence in the network; which likely causes further price drops. As the price drops further more miners are forced out of business. And thus the DeathSpiral gets its name.

Now the good news is that as Bitcoin is over 9 years old now; there are many many mines with many different strengths and weaknesses.

In the past 2 years or so people have realized this concept of the ""Bitcoin Battery"" ; I talked about it a couple years ago in these emails.

So what happens when you want to build a power plant for a new city or development and you want to plan for enough capacity to support the city once it reaches full capacity?

Well these plants end up with lots of excess power ; power generation at scale is not something that can be quickly turned on or off. Particularly the Green Energy sector. The sun is shining, the water is flowing, the wind is blowing ; you can't control when the energy is produced. So power companies connect to a grid and sell power to other municipalities to offset their costs while the town builds up.

But this is not possible in remote locations; power is lost over long distances. Sometimes even if you're nearby other municipalities they don't need your excess power.

Well if you have a small Hydro dam that is producing 10MWH per day and can only sell 5MWH per day; that is literally 5MW just being wasted going nowhere. You can only store so much in batteries. So then people have thought of other ingenious ways to store power. Using the excess power to pump water into a reservoir or tower; then using generators as the water flows back down. Actually this is a great way to store excess power. But this has limitations as well.

Anyways; in the past couple of years power companies and individuals have realized that you can use Bitcoin and Crypto as a battery for excess power. If you have free power that is literally getting thrown away; then even with cheap inefficient miners you'll earn more than throwing the power away. This will become more and more true as the mining arms race dies down in the next few years.

So power companies are setting up solar, wind, hydro, coal and all other kinds of power plants in remote, cold locations, and selling the excess power to the Bitcoin network while the towns and cities develop around them. Right now they are just dabbling with some small experiments here and there ; but if the experiments pan out (which they should) we will see the Big power companies become the biggest miners in just a few years.",1521806981,23/03/2018 12:09:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86k48g/hashrate_exploding_bitcoin_mining_driving/,30

Mathematical Proof that Bitcoin is Turing Complete has been published.,"[Link to paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3147440)

&gt;Turing’s original paper did not note that the tape needed to be infinite. Rather, it was unbounded. Turing said “The machine is supplied with a ‘tape’, (the analogue of paper) running through it, and divided into sections (called ‘squares’) each capable of bearing a ‘symbol’. At any moment there is just one square, say the r-th being the symbol s(r) which is ‘in the machine’”. The length of the tape is not specified. The process does have to halt if the system is Turing complete. Hence, with the requirement that such a machine is “calculable by finite means”, we express a finite but unbounded tape. In bitcoin, the limits imposed on the system limit the functional length of any script. It is conceivable that without these limits, and unbounded script could be created. It was Emil Post’s eponymous machine (*) but first implemented the concept of an infinite tape, not the Turing machine. This error has provided much of recent computer science. All digital computers are finite, just as all calculable problems must halt. The difficulty is in deciding if a problem is calculable within finite time. This problem has not of course mean solved or removed when applied in bitcoin, rather the problem has been transformed. If a compiler can create a script within the bitcoin language, we know that it halts. However, we do not know if the creation of the script is either possible or feasible until the result is known.

&gt;In this paper, we have demonstrated that bitcoin’s 2PDA is capable of computing any value that is computable in a system compatible with that of Godel’s logic system. Consequently, we have demonstrated that bitcoin script language is Turing complete. The relative power and functional implementation of a problem using bitcoin script is a separate issue. In a paper to follow this one, we shall extend Godel’s predicate system using bitcoin script operations. In being able to compile a script in bitcoin language, we have a system that always works within a defined bound. A deterministic and matched nondeterministic optimisation problem can be created within such bounds.

&gt;The richness and power of bitcoin scripting language has been overlooked due to the complexity of the system. In this paper we have demonstrated the true power of the system and how a complete implementation can create a script of a determined length and known maximum processing difficulty

Ever increasing blockchain solution?,"What if every wallet works like this. When you create a new wallet(address) it actually creates 2. After (arbtirary time) lets say 3 years, the whole balance is transfered automatically (wallets does this) to the second address (and a third address is created for later on etc...). For the user it is seemless.

Why?

This way the blockchain size only goes back 3 years max and everything is up to date an accounted for. This will keep the blockchain to a reasonable size for ever.

Ok now tear me apart and tell me I'm stupid for proposing a solution. (I know this wont work with paper wallets and if your wallet is offline but this is only version 1 of my shower thought)

Future of native mainnet transactions after sidechain and scaling solutions have been successfully implemented?,"From what I understand Bitcoin users will be able to continue to use the native mainnet as this stuff is pushed online. However are there any notions in the air or influential forces suggesting that native mainnet transactions will have a tax of sorts attached to them (unlike the regular fees) or not be allowed because of overhead?

If Bitcoin were to gain more adoption I guess the fees for using the mainnet would be enough to discourage a lot of users.

"Why should crypto trade at such an incredible premium, relative to any other way to transact payments?",The fact that your access to your money is only as good as your access to the internet doesn’t give me the warm fuzzies. I’d rather have gold coins. A cryptocurrency is supposed to give you ready access to your money and cost-free transactions. It doesn’t work that way because it’s hard to trade it. And this idea that it won’t be regulated is risible. Not a central bank on the planet will stand idly by while some alternative to the fiat money that is its lifeblood offers real competition.,1521835198,23/03/2018 19:59:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86nmm8/why_should_crypto_trade_at_such_an_incredible/,0

The Day-to-Day of a Bitcoin Miner,"Hey all,

I had a few questions to learn a little bit more about the mining community, specifically those who mine alone or within a pool.

1. What’s the normal day-to-day like for your mining operations? (i.e. do you have to check on the mining rig constantly, is it pretty relaxed after you set it all up, etc?)
2. What’s the biggest cost of running your rig?
3. Do you have any annoyances with running your rig, and if so what are they?
4. What type of miner do you use (GPU, CPU, FPGA, or ASIC)?
5. How many miners make up your rig? (1 ASIC, 2 ASICs, etc.)

Best,

"Hello /r/Bitcoin, this is Jared &amp; Derek from the Digital Assets Coalition of America. We are a national group of lobbyists and crypto lovers fighting to restore like-kind transactions and lower capital gains. Join us for our AMA this Sunday at 1PM est!","We will be hosting the AMA tomorrow, Sunday the 25th, at 1PM est on /r/CryptoCurrency

For now, we have X-Posted this on /r/CryptoCurrency:
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/86tp9l/hello_rcryptocurrency_this_is_jared_derek_from/

---

Before we were members of the Digital Assets Coalition of America (DAC), we watched as blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) grew from proof-of-concepts to the powerhouses of innovation that they are today. Digital assets and distributed applications are revolutionizing the way the world does business, manage data, assign and validate ownership, provide accountability, auditing, and more. Simply put, within a sensible regulatory climate, DLTs can fuel the American economy for generations to come.


However, there’s an issue happening right now that we as a community must come together and resolve. The crypto community deals with an unacceptable lack of representation in the creation of the federal policies that regulate everything from ICO participation to tax policy.


In response, we formed a coalition of innovators, strategists, lobbyists, and educators to ensure representation on the issues that affect us all. Through public education campaigns, congressional workshops, and face-to-face interaction with legislators, we’re educating the federal government on DLTs to promote a favorable regulatory climate, facilitate informed policymaking, and secure the USA’s position as a global leader in the digital asset arena.


Our first policy objective is to instate crypto-to-crypto trades as like-kind transactions. With the passing of the new tax bill, like-kind transactions only apply exclusively to real estate exchanges. This change has resulted in an over-complicated reporting process that makes filing compliant taxes exceptionally difficult and inefficient. The new bill also opens the risk for traders and users to be hit with massive taxes that are potentially disproportionate with their true profits.


Note: While we have accounting partners who worked under the interpretation that because cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal tax purposes, then U.S. Code § 1031 *previously applied*, this cannot be confirmed without specific guidance from the IRS. -- **As always, trust your accountant(s).**


Secondly, we want to reduce the capital gains tax rate for both short and long-term digital asset holdings. With current policy, every time digital assets are used to make a purchase, or when digital assets are converted to fiat, high capital gains tax are assessed on any potentially derived profit. This financial burden disincentivizes spending crypto, acts as a barrier to adoption, and ultimately prevents crypto from ever benefiting the economy.


Our team is composed of experts such as Stephani Scruggs, who led the resistance to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which resulted in nearly a dozen delayed Fast Track TPA votes and the ultimate demise of the TPA. Stephani has advised President Trump on international trade deals, currency manipulation, and the Chinese trade wars. She also has experience working closely with Congressional offices to strategize and develop international trade and economic policy, establishing her as a fountain of wisdom on Capitol Hill.


Or Michael Bowen, an international trade expert, whose organization advised the Trump campaign on trade agreements. Michael has also advised Congress on economics, housing development, international trade, and currency manipulation. Over the course of Michael’s career, he has negotiated over $1 billion in capital market transactions and implemented the largest affordable housing development in Hawaiian history.


Recently, we’ve on-boarded Frank McCarthy. After 20 years embedded in and advising on politics, media and policy making, as well as serving two House Transportation Committee Chairmen, Frank founded McCarthy Advanced Consulting (MAC). Frank uses his experience as a seasoned congressional staffer to run MAC, a nationally recognized lobbying firm that is known for helping unions fight above their weight class.
We want to make sure you’re a part of this process. We want you to ask us questions during the AMA this Sunday (the 25th) at 1PM est, but in the meantime, we have a few for you! 


1. Do you know of any industry leaders that you would like us to reach out to?

2. What policy would you like to see changed or put into law?

3. Do you have a thorough understanding or access to the resources necessary to pay taxes associated with your cryptocurrency?

4. What is your favorite cryptocurrency use-case?

5. What websites or publications do you use to stay updated on cryptocurrency news?

We look forward to seeing you Sunday at 1PM est! We'll be updating this post with the AMA link.

Thank you all for doing your part to Keep America FUD Free!

We live in exciting times!,"I'm actually quite fascinated by what's going on right now. I never thought we'd have the option of a quiet, peaceful revolution, but here it is. I'm actually excited!

I never thought bitcoin would be basically draining resources from the all powerful global banks. Whenever they try to take it down it just gets back up stronger. Why? It's because people have an interest in making it work. Why? Greed. The design is so elegant it just appeals to our very nature.

We're poking the dragon's heel with a needle and the needle is just going to get bigger and bigger until it turns into a sword that can slay the dragon. The more we use cash for small transactions the weaker the banks get. The more we use bitcoin for larger transactions or international payments the weaker the banks get. The more we keep our savings in gold/bitcoin or anything else that doesn't belong to the banks the weaker the banks get. They use our money against us. Time to take it back! When Lightning gets fully implemented there will be a revolution. It will be fast, it will be peaceful, it will be an overall positive change and it will be decentralized. 

TL;DR: Use cash for small transactions and bitcoin for either large transactions, international payments or simply storing value. Soon we'll have LN deployed and we'll be able to use bitcoin for things like daily groceries or coffee. Oh, right. Forgot an important one: HODL most of it, spend some of it and then reload.",1521852235,24/03/2018 00:43:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86pm9t/we_live_in_exciting_times/,128

In 2017, the SelfSell brand was created to build a “people-oriented” investment and financing platform, which allows direct investment in human, the fundamental agent through which all value can be created. SelfSell takes investment closer to its nature. This concept was strongly supported by Thomas Sargent, the 2011 Nobel Prize winner in economics and the leader of the rational anticipation school.

Around 4000 bitcoins on hard drive,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My brother passed away a few years ago.
My parents ended up putting all his stuff in storage as they couldn’t deal with it at the time.

Well they finally started getting around to sorting 
out his stuff and after a lot of nagging had me come and check out his old pc if it was worth keeping or not.

After hooking it up and looking around to my disbelief I found out he had bitcoins on this pc from years ago around 4000 worth. He apparently did some mining back in the day. I have his passwords as there was a notepad file on the desktop with all the info.

Anyway I know about bitcoin but never used it before and I’m wondering what’s the best way to cash all this out into our bank account? Can it be done in one big lump payment?",1521866035,24/03/2018 04:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86qvzn/around_4000_bitcoins_on_hard_drive/,0

Apple pay compatible BTC debit cards,"Hi all, im looking for a btc/crypto debit card which allows apple pay payments with virtual cards. 

The only one i could find was wirex, but they need 10days to verify my account :(. 

Can anyone recommend any other cards which allow this for UK residents ?

Edit: actually my account was just verified ! But i would still like to know any others out there

How bitcoin became popular in my company because of a missing payment terminal,"There is a coffee machine in our company. It is not possible to pay for a coffee with cash or credit card, the only option is to load some bucks onto a corporate badge using a special payment terminal. We have two buildings. The payment terminal is in one building and coffee machine is in another one. Frequently, when a  colleague forgets to load money onto the badge, instead of going to another building he/she asks another colleagues to pay for coffee using their loaded badge and simply gives them cash back.

Once I wanted to buy some coffee, but I had no cash and no money on my badge. So I asked my colleague, if I could pay for my coffee using BTC/BCH. He was surprised and said that he never used bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies, although has heard a lot about this subject. I helped him to download a wallet to his smartphone and paid him. He looked really happy, because these were his very first crypto assets. 

Next day, 2 guys came to my workplace. They wanted to know more about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, because my colleague told them the story about his first crypto deposit for coffee. During our lunch we talked a lot on cryptocurrencies. In two days we had 4 people in our crypto community and in one week there were already 15 people and it looks like more and more people are involved :). One of the guys even prepared a presentation for our management, how blockchain could be used in our company.

I’m really glad that there is no payment terminal in our building. Because of that, I’ve got acquainted with really good people and was able to spread some knowledge about my favourite topic - cryptocurrencies :D.",1521889556,24/03/2018 11:05:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86sdic/how_bitcoin_became_popular_in_my_company_because/,157

The adoption illusion - Miners are the biggest winners,"Offered as food for thought.. an observation not criticism. 

Merchant adoption is characterised by an increase in the amount of merchants that will accept Bitcoin for goods or services. More merchants accepting crypto, more crypto transactions, or that is the hope.

But what is the point and who is actually benefiting from more merchants and more transactions?  The process of purchasing goods or services from a merchant starts with using fiat from a bank to purchase Bitcoin, then the Bitcoin is exchanged for goods or services. The merchant exchanges the Bitcoin for fiat again and deposits into their bank account and pays tax (in fiat) on the profit made.

What have we achieved and who has benefitted from the process? We haven't used Bitcoin as a native currency we have used it as a medium of exchange, we haven't bypassed the banks or government controls per se, we haven't changed the world like we all hoped Bitcoin would. Considering most cryptos, like Bitcoin fluctuate in value it may have lost value in the meantime and we may have paid more for the goods or services.

Adoption sustains the blockchain with transactions, so the real winners here are actually the miners. The users and merchants get a warm fuzzy feeling about using and accepting Bitcoin but the fact is the process was quite pointless.

In the very near future some countries will use crypto as their national currency and paper money will be abolished. But that crypto will not be Bitcoin or any other crypto that uses a public blockchain. It will be crypto version of their own fiat currency.

So presently Bitcoin is really more useful as a store of value and a currency for the internet, than a currency for mainstream use in shops and business'

Let's write a song about Bitcoin by next Sunday,"Doesn't matter if it's great or ghetto, it'll be ours.

I heard this song recently, Kim Dotcom's megaupload song, it delivers a message about his product.

My bank in europe just closed my account because I'm an American citizen (Thanks FATCA !) and it made me even more of a believer in crypto. I know there are songs out there about Mt. Gox, the Silk Road, and bitcoin going up in price, but I think the next bitcoin song should be about why it is relevant today and what will come in the future.

Possible topics : 

Getting paid by the second with payment channels.
Anyone at any age can open an account in seconds.
Nobody can steal your money.
Borderless payments.
No supporting militaries you dont like.
No IRA / 401k lockup.

"United States, what should of happened vs what happened.","As a longterm bitcoin community member since '13 it pains me counting up hundreds of thousands of btc that have been auctioned off for pennies on the dollar. It has made those auction winners disgustingly rich, and they deserve all the credit for taking that no brainer gamble, hats off to you guys. Still to this day, auctions are still taking place from seized btc. This is my problem, the United States is headed down a slippery path, because of a blatant mismanagement of money, and an inability to make a change. My country is run by a majority of elderly representatives in congress. The problem I see is that older individuals are abrasive to emerging markets, dislike change and are comfortable with just what they know. As your IQ maxes out at about 25, these representatives are not as smart and sharp as their previous form. My problem, the United States government had one of the greatest assets to leverage our growing deficit, had the ability to leverage it to provide socialized health care for all citizens or do absolutely anything with it. They would of been one of the worlds biggest holders, but they refused to endorse, accept it, they tried to tarnish the name doing anything in their power to make it go away, and where does bitcoin, stand today. They call you crazy and cast down on your name before the embrace and adore you. It's sad that the US government didn't leverage their bets on the future global financial markets. It's just sad, seeing an impending recession on our doorsteps, political turmoil, widespread media manipulation, and overall distrust of leadership and we did it to ourselves. In the end, it's a whole lot of woulda, coulda, shoulda's, a purging of our leadership to newer faces needs to be in order.",1521911759,24/03/2018 17:15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86ufkw/united_states_what_should_of_happened_vs_what/,0

"Trade war with China could be bad for dollar, good for bitcoin","https://i.imgur.com/dZzteIn.jpg

My preliminary analysis indicates that a trade war could work to devalue the dollar. China has been pegging the Yuan as devalued in relation to the USD since 2001 when they joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). This has had the effect of tilting the whole playing table so that goods ""roll down hill"" more easily to the US and goods really have an uphill battle getting from the US into China.

Trump is not willing to start off fixing this by devaluing the dollar, so he's using tariffs. But could tariffs have a devaluatory effect on the US Dollar?

If so, bitcoin stands to gain ground even faster than it is now.

See here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-06/a-trade-war-road-map-for-fx-markets-take-cover-find-your-niche

&gt; “It’s a bit of a double-edged sword,” said Tannuzzo at Columbia Threadneedle. “The dollar should ultimately strengthen in the short-term against the currencies affected by the tariffs; in the long-run, it could stay under pressure overall because it has to fund large and growing current-account deficits.”

When currency investors ""take cover"", it would be great if there was a currency that was immune to all this trade war chaos....

Oh wait.",1521921194,24/03/2018 19:53:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/86vi9c/trade_war_with_china_could_be_bad_for_dollar_good/,142

PSA: Gemini’s Fee Structure,"This is an email sent mid February in case some of y'all didn't see it. Free transfer is no longer 30 but 10 now. After the 10th free transfer, you will get charged 0.002 BTC per BTC withdrawal or 0.001 ETH per ETH withdrawal at the end of the month. So if I made 20 btc transfer last month, they will debit my account .02 btc, thats like $20 per transfer. You won't know about the debit unless you check your account history, you wont get notification or email about it. Keep track of your transfer

&gt;This email is to notify you that Gemini will be collecting withdrawal fees accrued during February 2018 on March 1, 2018. 

&gt;As a reminder, effective January 17, 2018, we modified our Transfer Fee Schedule pursuant to our User Agreement as follows: starting on February 1, 2018, Gemini will debit your account balance for any withdrawals in excess of 10 complimentary withdrawals per digital asset per calendar month, and the fee per withdrawal in excess of 10 is 0.002 BTC per BTC withdrawal or 0.001 ETH per ETH withdrawal.

&gt;When we debit your account balance, you will see a line in your transaction history that says “a Gemini administrator has debited your account.”

&gt;These withdrawal fees align with current market prices for transaction fees on the BTC and ETH blockchains; however, Gemini is actively working on an initiative to make this a better experience going forward, including:

&gt;Indicating how many free withdrawals you have left per digital asset per calendar month;
Charging withdrawal fees at the time of the withdrawal; and
Using techniques like SegWit transactions and batched transactions to lower fees and save space on the blockchain.
&gt;Should you have any questions, please refer to the our User Agreement.

&gt;Onward and Upward! 

&gt;Team Gemini 







Any idea when this will be a thing?

&gt;Indicating how many free withdrawals you have left per digital asset per calendar month;
Charging withdrawal fees at the time of the withdrawal; and
Using techniques like SegWit transactions and batched transactions to lower fees and save space on the blockchain.

We have no BTC atm (it got banned last year), BTC debit card services is not supported in the country and to sell on localbitcoin.com is simply near impossible.

Merchant cold start with Lightning,"Suppose I am a merchant, which I am, and want to accept Lightning payments.

In order to do that I should have active channels with positive amounts on the other side of those channels, as I understand.

Who will provide this liquidity for me in those channels?

Options I have:

* My recurring customers which will open channels with me.
* Some sort of a entity/bank that will trust in me to provide liquidity (trust in terms of freezing their funds in a channel and hope I will have enough turnover for them to have profits).

Are there any other options?

"Is there a way we can connect/communicate with our fellow HODLers in Korea, Japan, etc.?","I would love to be able to see what fellow HODLers/traders are thinking in Asian countries that have a lot higher trading volume such as Korea, Japan, China, and even India. So far the best I've been able to do is watch Korean YouTube videos about Bitcoin with translation on, which isn't the best. And honestly it feels like we are living in our own little bubble (not financial bubble), not connected to a lot of traders/HODLers that don't use Reddit or do only use their countries respective social media sites. So, is there a way we can bridge the gap between us crypto users in the West with the ones in the East, seeing their perspective into BTC and the markets? Even if its just translated news articles from Asian countries, that's good too.

Bitcoin world currency?,"Is anyone seeing the obvious problem that 80% of bitcoin is already out there in the hands of around 100,000 people?
How are we going to make it fair for the rest of the 7 billion people out there? 

EDIT: In other words how the hell is Bitcoin supposed to push in to a World Currency with 99% of world population not owning one? are the 1% going to force the 99% to go down in wealth and buy satoshis? 
Is a random dude with 1,000 Bitcoin going to try to convince Netherlands that replacing their fiat wealth to approx 1,500 Bitcoin is good for them?

Bitcoin can be anything but a leading world currency

"Bitcoin is digital gold and the LightningNetwork uses cryptographically secured and trustless “IOU’s” as a medium of exchange backed by bitcoin, for efficiency. Like when paper money was backed by gold in 1844. But this time no one can suddenly take the gold away.","Edit:

Yikes, this blew up a little and I’m being hit from all angles about why I’m wrong.

I probably shouldn’t have used the term “IOU” cause it insinuates debt, as well as there being counter party risk. My point is that it’s like having the most trusted and secure IOU in the world, because it’s not backed by promise of the other person, it’s backed by cryptography, so you can claim your money at any time, or you can continue to pass it on to the next person without any risk. So in that sense, it is similar to an IOU, but it’s trustless.

I really liked this analogy and I was hoping this would just be an easy way for people to understand but I was wrong.

Edit 2: I think a better word would have been “promise”. LN is like exchanging trustless and secure promises of funds, which carry no risk, unlike when paper money was a promise to the equivalent value in gold and the promise was broken.

"An On-chain tx is like weighing gold, lightning is like a minted gold coin.","Gold was used as a currency before coins the transactions were slow and infrequent because it required someone with scales to weigh.  
When coins were minted this allowed anyone to transact instantly without weighing the gold, allowing for more transactions to happen rapidly.   

Lightning transactions are similar in the sense it allows you to transfer value without having to wait for the verification (a block) to receive the money. Like gold, the coins in lightning can be ""melted"" back to the blockchain or recast into new lightning coins.  
To use lightning you don't have to melt and recast coins, you can simply trade or work for more coins, or exchange them for un-minted gold.  
  
A Gold  coin is not an IOU for an ounce of gold, it **is** an ounce of gold, in a format that is self verifying. A lightning transaction is not an IOU it **is** a bitcoin transaction.   
  
To help you imagine how the lightning network works from a practical perspective, imagine it like a supply of minted gold coins in a city. If more coin is needed, bullion would be stamped into to coins (channels). If more bullion is needed, coins can be melted to make bars (standard tx's).

BDPL is a poison pill,"Has anyone noticed that the [Blockchain Defensive Patent License (BDPL)]( 
https://blockchaindpl.org/licensev10) under which Little Dragon and Halong are making the ASICBoost technology available **is not** the same [Defensive Patent License  (DPL)](https://defensivepatentlicense.org/license) which Blockstream joined to much fanfare a few months back? It is an entirely different agreement, with a different set of participants and wildly different rules. The BDPL appears to be based on the DPL, but has multiple additions that fundamentally alter the license.

On closer inspection, it is easy to see that the BDPL is set up to favor malicious participants. For instance, limitations that cover the reasons why an license may automatically be revoked listed in section 2(e) have been extended with the following:

&gt; iii. Licensee is or becomes licensed to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or distribute a Patent owned by or licensed to any Person (who is not a party or otherwise bound by this BDPL), and such Patent is or is likely to be enforced (such as the issuance of a cease &amp; desist letter, letters or requests asking for settlement or royalty payments or the filing or initiation of any Proceedings) against a BDPL User;

This is the ultimate escape clause for a malicious participant. If a BDPL User (A) has license to an unrelated third-party's patent (T) and a malicious BDPL User (M) infringes on T, A loses their license to M's technology but A's grant to M remains.

The BDPL is a poison pill. If the development of efficient mining processes becomes dependent on any technology licensed through this regime, all it will take to crush competitors is for a  malicious participant to cause the others to lose their license.

**Edit**

The DLP and BDPL are not even compatible. Any entity who is a member of both exposes themselves to the clause described above.

**DPL** - you will grant all other DPL Users license to your IP in exchange for theirs.

**BDPL** -  you will grant all other BDPL Users license to your IP in exchange for theirs *and never make use of non-BDPL technology.*

Suppose Halong also joins the DPL so they may make use of the defensive patents Blockstream has made available through it. Bitmain sees an opportunity for evil here and joins the BDPL, gaining access to ASICBoost, but *does not* join the DPL. Halong, now having license to Bitmain's IP, incorporates their serial power supply circuit into their design. The trap is sprung! Bitmain intentionally and flagrantly infringes on a patent held by Blockstream. Acting reasonably, predictably, and **defensively**, Blockstream sends Bitmain a C&amp;D kindly asking them to stop the infringement. Bitmain terminates Halong's license to the serial power technology under BDPL 2(e)iii. Halong must stop production, use, sale, export, etc. of all their models using the technology, at least until they can come to some licencing agreement with Bitmain.",1521994718,25/03/2018 16:18:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/871pm6/bdpl_is_a_poison_pill/,29

I did this! [Image in the text],"https://imgur.com/7RWs1C8 (**scroll to the bottom of the image to see BTC logo**)

I am compering for one of the events here in Dubai. This is a musical evening being performed by a popular Indian band. So, I had a chat with the organizers and they have included **Bitcoin logo** in their fliers and publicity materials instead of my fees (roughly 800$ for 3 hours). I have been a supporter of Bitcoin for couple of years now.

Now, here's the thing....I wanted to play a '*what is bitcoin?*' video to the audience (estimated to be roughly 1500 between ages 20 and 50) during the event a couple of times. I haven't spoken regarding this to the organizers yet. 

Should I ask? I believe, most of the audience would have no clue about what bitcoin is and this would be a great opportunity to get the word! Would it make sense? Also will be checking with the organizers whether they would accept bitcoin for entrance fees. 

Would need the help of the community in order to help play the video as this would need being a sponsor of the event. They already have the main sponsor. One of the 2 Associate sponsor spots are open which are roughly for $5k.

I have not shared any BTC address as it would not be right without a consensus of the community to ask.

I am ready to donate more BTC. More info will be shared about the event as we head. Thanks in advance!

DM me if you need more clarification.

How to convert block hex into human-readable format? (Block parser),"I want to analyze the frequency and size of transactions per block in bitcoin. I'm wondering if anyone has written an open-source program to convert blocks stored in hex to text, or objects (any programming language is fine)? 

Or if you know of somebody who's just got a few blocks already decoded that would be helpful too. I'm just trying to get a hold of data in a more easily-workable form since I imagine writing a parser from scratch would take awhile. 

I've looked into the tool BlockSci, that can do something similar, but it requires a fully operational node, and I don't have 160GB of spare memory on me.

GDPR: A Game Changer Is Coming for Cryptocurrency,"GDPR – What’s Important to Retain
There are many important rules companies must follow starting from June 2018, that will actively protect customers against corporations data theft and abuse (ie, selling your data without your consent or creating complicated terms and agreements most users do not fully understand). I advise you to read through the whole thing especially if you (like me) work in IT, are responsible for an IT department or have your own startup; but there’s one single point I believe to be most destructive for many cryptocurrencies:

Yes indeed, each user has the right to be forgotten, meaning, all user data should be able to get permanently deleted. Let’s say if I chose to delete my facebook account, anything I have ever posted, commented, liked, etc has to disappear. It does seem simple when you own your own infrastructure, but due to one of the most important properties of blockchain technology being its immutability, you can already see the problem bubbling up.

Any platform that uses a distributed ledger to store user data (blockchain, Vitalik coin) is, by all means, screwed. There is absolutely no way around this. What if companies just ignore this new enforcement? Well, the fine is only 4% of your company’s revenue, up to 20 Million Euros.

So if you have invested in a project, own a project or are generally interested in better understanding how this market will evolve, please do pay attention to the following: storing any user data on any public distributed ledger is half-way to a really, really, really unpleasantly expensive outcome.

From the top 100 cryptocurrencies, how many can you identify that will face issues due to this new regulation? Platforms that hold user data in any form must assure there is a way for that data to be deleted. Let me underline this again: it means a big no-no to storing any user data on a ledger from where that data cannot be deleted.

What about other rules?
Other key changes can be followed without compromising the concept of immutable distributed ledger technology. If you want more information on the subject I highly advise you to read this article. All these points are explained brilliantly by the author. If you want a more in-depth understanding of how this problem could be avoided see this one. In short, you would have to consider off-chain storing of data; this is, centralized servers.

Now what?
Raise awareness, speak to members of projects where you’re heavily invested and try to read as much as possible on the subject. Learning is the only way you’ll ever feel safe. Your opinion is the one you should value the most, as there is no one who will look-out better for yourself than… well, yourself!

Using a Bitcoin ATM with someone else's phone number...,"I live in Las Vegas and CoinFlip just put a bunch of Bitcoin ATMs in the city, so I went down to one today and checked it out. Apparently at $700 USD or lower, you only need to accept an SMS (text) message and put in the code it gives you to buy Bitcoin through the machine.

My question is: What law is being broken (if any) if I, theoretically, ask a stranger to accept the SMS so that my phone number isn't linked to the transaction? Is it actually illegal to do that, or does it only become illegal to do that if I'm doing to in order to evade taxes or launder money or some other illegal action?",1522026541,26/03/2018 01:09:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/875amu/using_a_bitcoin_atm_with_someone_elses_phone/,0

Finally had enough with coinbase,"Absolutely ludicrous and ineffective security polices. Tried to log into a new device after getting a new phone. I have access to the following info: my password, full account info, my email address associated with the account, the phone number for 2AF.

I was given 2 methods of recourse: wait 48 hours or give a photo ID. Kindly fuck off, coinbase.

My favorite part of all this is the sheer ineffectiveness it would have if someone was actually trying to steal my account. I received no notification that a new device was tried, so the thief could just wait the 48 hours, and also if someone already had access to my password, full account info, my email address associated with the account, the phone number for 2AF, you can bet that they sure as hell have my fucking ID.

Can Bitcoin stimulate a regional economy?,"In theory there are at least five major ways of how crypto-currencies in general and Bitcoin in particular may positively affect a local economy:

1) by increasing level of living of non-working population groups reliant on remittances from their relatives employed in other regions or countries (as a result of reduced transactional costs);
2) by speeding and facilitating business transacting in the remote areas traditionally deprived of access to banking and other financial services (otherwise dependent on economically inefficient forms of barter);
3) by fostering a local consumption boom (as a result of growing prices on crypto-exchanges and widened adaption of digital money by retail businesses);
4) by creating more jobs (for example, as a result of new startups appearing in the area);
5) by attracting more business travelers and temporary highly qualified workers to the region with the liberal regulatory regime towards crypto (as in a case of the Swiss city Zug tagged as ""Crypto Valley"").
In practice, however, there's been not enough factual information accumulated so far to decisively demonstrate that one of those effects has already visible manifested itself somewhere in the world.

Idea for increasing adoption - Calculated group effort.,"Essentially large companies would adopt Bitcoin on the condition that enough consumers would be willing to purchase their goods with it. Chances are you may have never contacted a company to confirm if they will accept BTC as payment prior to making a purchase. You may have never even made a purchase with BTC unless it was for other crypto.

This needs to change, I recently contacted a mattress company to confirm if they would accept BTC as payment in which they responded with a simple “No”. Then it got me wondering. How many consumers have emailed or tweeted this company to ask that? Probably not many. Then I thought, well, how many emails and tweets would it take before a company thought “fuck it” we need to adapt now and make BTC an accepted form a payment??

My theory is quite simple, if enough people contact a company to ask if they accept BTC then it will only be a matter of time before they adopt the infrastructure they need to make BTC an acceptable form of payment.

To test this theory, I’m pleading with you to help out by sending a simple email or tweet. I contacted Simba Mattresses so these maybe a good example to start with. They are a medium sized enterprise who clearly spend a lot of marketing. Further to this, they don’t currently accept BTC. Let’s see if we can change this, it really won’t matter what country you are in or even if you want to buy one of their products. Simply contact them using the details below and say “I want to buy one of your mattresses, do you accept bitcoin?”

With an influx of potential sales coming through they will have no choice but to advertise on their site that they do now in fact accept BTC.

Tweet - [@simbasleep](https://mobile.twitter.com/SimbaSleep)

Email - hello@simbasleep.com

If successful there would be nothing stopping us using the mass power we have as a community to continue this campaign and work on other larger companies adopting BTC.

"The principle for democratic governments going forward: ""Separation of Church, State, and Money""","The more well separated these sources of power are, the better off the average person is.  One can imagine the geographically defined governments of the world taking a backseat to a global internet ""state"".  People could freely associate with different groups (e.g., gun owners, dog owners, people who like the Mississippi River, car enthusiasts, fiscal conservatives, racists, social progressives, women, men, bikers, pro-marijuana, anti-drug, Catholic, Shinto, makes-less-than-$40k-per-year, etc, etc), each association would vote internally for priorities and require dues.  Politicians would no longer be able to decide *how much* money gets spent on what; they could only decide on budget priorities.  The money would then come from affected organizations' dues.  They would have to court associations made up of everyday people to get funding for their political projects.

It seems clear to me that this is the direction the world needs to go.  Thoughts?

Edit:  Another fun feature of this type of organization is resistance to corruption.  If association ""Fans of the Mississippi River"" gets infiltrated by industry shills that want to ruin the river, there would be no cost for everyone to jump ship and join ""Fans of the Mississippi River version 2"".  The available budget for the first group would drop to zero overnight and politicians would have to court the newly formed group.  It would make it expensive to be corrupt because the cost of re-associating would be low.  Similar to the early days of Reddit.  Digg did some stuff the users didn't like so they jumped ship and joined ""Digg version 2"".  It's corruption resistant democracy that keeps money out of politicians hands.",1522062962,26/03/2018 11:16:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/878bdk/the_principle_for_democratic_governments_going/,66

* gpg --recv-keys 7F9470E6

Or save from: [7F9470E6] (https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0x2BD5824B7F9470E6) as ThomasV.asc

Go back to Electrum [website](https://electrum.org/#download) and download Electrum-3.1.1.tar.gz and its signature Electrum-3.1.1.tar.gz.asc

Copy all the 3 files to the same folder, open the terminal and use command 'cd' to navigate to that folder and run these commands.

* gpg --import ThomasV.asc

* gpg --verify Electrum-3.1.1.tar.gz.asc Electrum-3.1.1.tar.gz

If the message returned says Good signature and that it was signed by ThomasV with a fingerprint that ends with 7F9470E6, then the software is authentic.

Over the past couple of months, I have been developing a tool help make the task of calculating capital gains and preparing taxes easier for anyone who has ever bought and sold crypto. Right now, it allows you to upload trades from any exchange, add your income, and export your gain/loss reports over multiple tax years.

I plan on adding many more features such as the ability to import your trade history through exchange APIs, but was hoping to get some feedback from you guys first. If you have the time, I would love to hear if you find anything that is unclear with the tool or if you run into any issues creating your report.

I also wrote a few guides on how to get started with the tool:

Create a Bitcoin Hardware Wallet with Golang and a Raspberry Pi Zero,"Hi,

I recently spent a lot of time designing and developing a cryptocurrency hardware wallet for Bitcoin and a few Altcoins using a Raspberry Pi Zero (no wireless), Golang, and Angular.

The link to the project is here:

https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/03/create-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-golang-raspberry-pi-zero/

I am not a cryptocurrency expert and I am not an expert with encryption, but what I've developed seems to work. It would mean a lot to me if I got some constructive feedback on the project as well as things I could improve.

To sum up how it works, Ethernet emulation over USB is enabled on the Raspberry Pi Zero since it has no form of wireless or Bluetooth connectivity. A Golang application is deployed to the Raspberry Pi Zero and this application serves an API that only the host machine can access, hence the emulation over USB. The API encrypts the wallet data and is accessible via an Angular frontend that is bundled in the Golang application.

Hyper Risky Strategy,"Step 1.
Use your previously excellent credit to obtain a mortgage. on a house.

Step 2. 
Sell the house for $300,000

Step 3.
Use the $300,000 mortgage to buy leveraged longs on btc on kraken. ONLY 25x leverages. 

Step 4. 
Wait for the lunar explosion when the bitcoin rocket hits. 

Step 5.
Flee the country. Whether you win or lose, the IRS or the bank will want some of your precious btc hoard. Thailand and russia look quite friendly...

still master of the domain,"as we see the death spiral of the alt-coins, scam coins, and false promises, Bitcoin still remains the king coin.  

The clampdown on ICO's is whats negatively affecting ETH and all the other ERC20 tokens.

C. Lee's recent announcement about Litepay and how that went down in flames just shows the importance of how a successful coin cant have its founder wield too much power. imagine all the negative press that he's going to get now that everyone knows he sold his holdings at the high point. even though he did it for genuine reasons to keep the integrity of the network away from one person, the optics still don't work in LTC's favor.

These two factors show how BTC's slow and steady approach is what works best. LN going live after years in development, Satoshi remaining anonymous, and the focus on staying as decentralized as possible is what gives BTC its true status as the king coin.

its like something Antonopoulous said: Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin.

Another bearish cycle ahead ? This is maybe why !,"Guys I kind of feel some know something we don't . We have many mega positive news about the crypto and BTC that in good old days would have pushed the prices really up but now it looks like no one is paying attention to it. The big money are not coming !

Just do the list of the positive news from G20 to Barclays - coinbase partnership or the low fees with BTC and then check where we are now . If we are emptying positions is this because the cryptomarket is not going to offer the performance we expect ? 

I don't exclude cooling of the market for the next 6-12 months before or the regulatory frameworks, institutional exchanges and partnerships are fully in place to allow the masses to get on the train . 

I feel the next jump will be more powerful and longer than what we saw in December but this time the people will be buying more than the whales . We just need to create the channels for that but this won't happen tomorrow . 

Meanwhile many ventures / funds can maintain the fuds and keep buying BTC and other cryptos for really cheap price without being noticed by anyone because they spread it over a year. 

After the coins will be in the hands of very few and then the Big advertising campaign will start to jump the market. What are your thoughts? Do you have your scenarios or what explains the drops of today ?

What's the point of BTC being public?,"I only got interested in crypto-currencies recently, I started investing in January after the crypto-crash.

I love the idea behind cryptos as they allow us to free ourselves from the corrupt banking system. However, bitcoin is completely public. If I know your wallet address then I can look up how much money you currently hold. This is in contrast to real world wallets and bank accounts, the knowledge of how much funds I have is mine and mine alone. I don't really want people to know how much I'm worth.

Due to the above, I've started using a different crypto-currency instead that's completely private. No one can look up how much I'm worth, no one can monitor my transactions. This seems like the holy grail of crypto to me.

Does the bitcoin foundation have plans to introduce privacy at some point? That would bring me back to BTC.

Need help sweeping private key from Abra wallet.,"This is the text from their customer support:

I do understand it is a complicated process, so we’ll certainly try to help you out here. To sweep wallet, please follow these instructions: https://decentral.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217877418-How-do-I-transfer-funds-from-a-paper-wallet-private-key- You are sweeping your Abra private into an external wallet To obtain your Abra private key, use a tool like: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ Please note that we are not liable for lost funds or any issues arising from using this tool - use this at your own risk. It is NOT an official Abra tool, nor do we endorse it. We are simply giving you on example of a tool to do this. Again, use at your own risk. Remove the ‘at’ in the 13 word phrase to get your standard 12 word mnemonic private key. Put these 12 words into the BIP39 Mnemonic The derivation path would be BIP32. The external deposit addresses will follow the pattern m/1'/0/0, m/1'/0/1, m/1'/0/2. Sweep the derived addresses that are generated near the bottom. Many of the derived addresses may be empty, you will likely have to try all three derivation paths (m/1'/0/0, m/1'/0/1, m/1'/0/2).

Can't sweep properly using sentinel and samourai on android. What exactly should I put as the BIP32 derivation path and should I use hardened addresses? And it seems like there's infinite amount of derived addresses to scan.",1522096908,26/03/2018 20:41:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87cis7/need_help_sweeping_private_key_from_abra_wallet/,5

wallet.dat connected to passphrase?,"I recently found my old wallet.dat file from 2014 and was able to successfully download a new client, transfer it to appdata, and synchronize to the network, so now my wallet recognizes what I've deposited. However, when I try to send btc, it's asking for my passphrase. I thought my passphrase was a 12-word string, but I've figured out that's a seed. I got it when I downloaded the new client, so I thought that was my passphrase.

My question is, is the wallet.dat connected to a passphrase provided to me when I downloaded my wallet over 4 years ago? I never remember setting a passphrase  for my wallet then, and if it's not this 12-string code I recieved downloading the latest wallet, I guess I don't remember setting one now.

Support needed in recovery of a old Bitcoin wallet (reward offered),"Hi guys,

So long short story, i have a iPhone 6 which I recently got my hands back on. It hasn’t been used since September 2015. At that time, I was using on it the Ninki Wallet ( ninkip2p.com ) Bitcoin wallet. At the time I stopped using the phone I had 2.65 BTC on the wallet. In December 2015, Ninki announced that they are closing their doors and advised everyone to move their funds to a different wallet. Unfortunately I did not do so and now I am trying to recover them.

I have all the info necessary: offline recovery phrase, online recovery phrase and public master key.
The recovery script that they provide is:
https://github.com/Ninkip2p/ninki-recover
The main issue is that it uses a API for fetching data that does not work anymore ( chain.com API ), so when I ran it it replied with this error message ( Chrome console ):
Failed to load https://api.chain.com/v1/bitcoin/addresses/3GXJPPyKrtd7EZFjj6PsZfD13Rq4VCRrzo: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 405.

Now, I got someone to edit the script for me and they changed the chain.com API to chain.so API. With the original one, I couldn’t get past Step 4 in the recovery app - it just fetched infinitely; with the modified one, it gets to Step 5 but the only issue is that the script says the Balance is 0 BTC. Which isn’t real, according to my addresses page and the wallet history. I guess the problem might be the script can’t fetch the data properly OR the data is faulty?

So...I’m in need of help/advice? If someone can get this stuff sorted out I am willing to give 0.4 BTC out of the final amount. Thanks!

Original recovery script: https://github.com/Ninkip2p/ninki-recover

I'm a researcher trying to analyze China's degree of control over Bitcoin. How can I find more Chinese Bitcoin addresses?,"I'm working on a personal (unfunded, independent) research project trying to understand exactly how much control the Chinese government has over Bitcoin and how they could use that control to their strategic advantage. 

One aspect of the analysis I'm conducting is trying to compare activity, trends, and anomalies in various Bitcoin metrics between the global Bitcoin userbase and the Chinese userbase. I have had some success scraping Bitcoin addresses from Chinese-linked posts on Bitcointalk forums. But I'm trying to get a larger corpus for my analysis.

Can you guys suggest any other forums, e-shops, etc. where I might be able to find some more Bitcoin addresses that belong to users in China? I'm thinking: Chinese businesses that accept Bitcoin as payment, Chinese-hosted coin-mixing services, or other discussion forums that have some Chinese users who might have posted their addresses.

Bank of Jamaica confirmed that Bitcoin is not legal tender in the country.,"In Jamaica, as, arguably, in every other country in the world, crypto-currencies are not legal tender. However, island's financial gate-keepers, unlike those of its Caribbean region's neighbors, have found it necessary to make an additional step back on the road leading to financial revolution.

In February 2018 the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ)'s representative made a pointed statement, where he explicitly warned citizens on the numerous dangers, which, from this representative's point of view, are closely connected with using digital money. As it's already became customary in all similar cases, involved numerous public servants making broad, unsubstantiated accusations, this particular mouthpiece of the mainstream finance didn't bother to provide any data or even a single fact to support his lavish rhetorics.

Particularly amusing was to hear as this particular official swore to protect the local financial system from risks associated with modern technologies. Certainly, with Jamaican dollar's inflation rate averaging 10% a year during the past two decades, this ""system"" is deserving not to be ""protected"" by over-zealous and tech-inept bureaucrats but fundamentally changed instead.

On a positive side, despite of all this colorful ceremonious oratory, there's not much what BOJ is set to do in practice to suppress the local crypto-community, besides refusing again to authorize any enterprise supporting virtual money trading platforms. That, of course, limits Jamaicans freedom to manage their own liquid assets but is incapable to stop slow and sure advance of new financial technologies.

Circle pay question,"Hey all, forgive me if this is obviously the super wrong section but I’ve seen a lot of questions about circle pay on this sub and I can’t find the answer to my questions so I thought I’d give it a shot.

I’ve used circle for a while now and I’ve loved it until today they are asking for ID verification before moving money to my account ($15) and my questions is, is it safe to give them my ss number? And second, I  use circle with a stage name and on the profile it says name and then “what others see” or something, I’m assuming I have to change the name to my real name before I give them my ss, but will others see my real name or still only “what others see” it sounds obvious but I just want to make sure.

Lightning Network proposals (aka half-baked ideas by a unqualified person) regarding channel states-penalty transactions. Programmers/Developer savvy people please destroy these ideas.,"In a recent post an episode of penalty transaction was discussed where an individual broadcasted an outdated channel state possibly accidentally. It was discussed how from a network point of view faulty functioning of the client has to be treated as fraud for trustlessness, and how if a user loses his current state data they may have to trust another individual for a copy of the most recent state.

**Edit** per /u/alineali recommendation I am defining the problem first.

The **problem** as gathered by me is that the client side state data became corrupt, then the client reloaded an outdated backup of state data. From the thread of comments I assume there are many methods by which this could occur including hardware failure.

My **objective** with these ideas is to come up with a reliable, secure, trustless means to verify or obtain the latest state broadcast

**End Edit**

I had the following ideas (in reverse order to put the one that I'm more confident in first.)

1.
&gt;... another idea, a redundancy hub, maybe run by an open source code on the ethereum or other Turing complete chain the simply records your latest state broadcast and will accurately transmit it for the fuel cost.

2.
&gt;I know this is pretty redundant but what about a state blockchain? Instead of a global chain you could have local chains or maybe 'microchains' where 3 or more interested but trustless parties are reliant on accurate states could publish to the blockchain. It would provide the level of trustlessness required without requiring the global resources of a larger chain. I need to think on this because obviously a malicious party could 51% attack a smaller chain pretty easily. Really just throwing ideas into the wind here, I am not a developer

So I'm pretty sure the blockchain one isn't feasible, but I'm so unqualified in this matter I'd rather let someone else thoroughly destroy it.  

I do not know what issues might arise from running a lightning hub as a Dapp that can transmit someone's most recent state for anyone who opened a channel with it. This is even further out of my knowledge base but I feel like this might be something someone could actually implement that could help reduce user side error with a trustless application. 

Any time I have what I feel is a bright idea I am reminded of this quote from HPMOR ""He has not yet had enough ideas to unflinchingly discard those that are beautiful in some aspects and impractical in others; he has not yet acquired confidence in his own ability to think of better ideas as he requires them. What we are seeing here is not Mr. Malfoy's best idea, I fear, but rather his only idea.""

Like I said I don't have enough specialty here to discard anything, but I don't want to be bothered by this problem if there could have been a solution. So if you see the Achilles heel of these idea please, please, share them.

"I want a Digital Will service with a ""LOST"" button (like in the TV show). Let me explain!","I want a distributed message service that I can send anyone a short message. 

The service needs to be distributed, so that I don't have to worry about the service being shut down, or its servers seized after my death. We'll get to my death in a minute.

I want this service to allow me to send a special kind of message... one that will only send if I haven't (prevented, stopped, paid tokens to miners, [whatever]) that message from sending after a set amount of time (or mined blocks).

So, in other words, here's the scenario I want to see:

I have a 12-word seed for a bitcoin wallet that I have encrypted with a public key that only my son has. I put that *encrypted* text in a message to my son's wallet. (This wallet is not a Bitcoin wallet, but a wallet (account) on this new service that I'm describing). *However* even though the message has been recorded in the blockchain, it will not be delivered to him yet, because at least once every 30 days, I pay 1 MessageCoin (or whatever) to prevent the message from being delivered. I don't want it delivered *now*, then my kid would have bitcoin that I only want him to have in the event of my death.

So 5 years after I set all this up, and after 5 years of paying 1 MessageCoin per month (or whatever) I'm killed in a car accident. After 30 days pass, and no payment of 1 MessageCoin has been recieved, the message is sent, my son receives it, decrypts it, and has access to the wallet I set up for him.

Everyone's happy. And at no point did I have to trust ANYONE. Not a bank, not a safe... ... ... not my wife.

Does anyone else see the tremendous value this would provide for anyone who would like to leave digital assets to loved ones in the event of their death?

This service would have other applications as well... 

Let's say I don't feel comfortable with keeping a word seed written down on paper, because I feel it could always be found by someone, or I could lose it. Why not simply encrypt it, and pay a token a month to keep it from being sent (to yourself!)... now if you ever forget your word seed, you don't lose all your Bitcoin, you just stop paying the token to the network and the message is sent (to you) 30 days later. You decrypt it, and your back in business.

We have, what, 2000 altcoins now? Can one of them be what I'm describing? I would mine the shit out of this, and I think a lot of other people would too.

Tell me this is already being done, or that it's impossible, or where I should pitch it next. Because a service just like what I describe is sorely needed.",1522149734,27/03/2018 11:22:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87hlz6/i_want_a_digital_will_service_with_a_lost_button/,8

"When I mine a bitcoin, how can I prove that it was mined by me?"," 0
down vote
favorite

let's say, I'm not using a pool to mine bitcoins,let's think that I mine directly with the blockchain (correct word?) .. say, I use following code (for an example purpose) to mine and find the hash which is below the target, So, to prove that I (my public wallet address) mined the coin, shouldn't I include my public wallet address or anything as data along with those block hashes, nonce etc ? or is it mixed with the final hash and send to the blockchain? if I mix it (concatenate etc) with the ""final hash"" and re-hashing again with SHA256? then it won't be a valid hash then. How do block chain recognizes my public wallet address and reward ""me"" when I only use the data of version, previous block hash, merkle root, time, bits, nonce? 

Sample code 

    $version = littleEndian(1);
    $prevBlockHash = SwapOrder('00000000000008a3a41b85b8b29ad444def299fee21793cd8b9e567eab02cd81');
    $rootHash = SwapOrder('2b12fcf1b09288fcaff797d71e950e71ae42b91e8bdb2304758dfcffc2b620e3');
    $time = littleEndian(1305998791);
    $bits = littleEndian(440711666); 
    $nonce = littleEndian(2504433986); 

    //concat it all
    $header_hex = $version . $prevBlockHash . $rootHash . $time . $bits . $nonce;

    //convert from hex to binary 
    $header_bin  = hex2bin($header_hex);
    //hash it then convert from hex to binary 
    $pass1 = hex2bin(  hash('sha256', $header_bin )  );
    //Hash it for the seconded time
    $pass2 = hash('sha256', $pass1);
    //fix the order
    $FinalHash = SwapOrder($pass2);

CoinJoin + signature aggregation as a scaling solution?,"Hi bitcoiners! While browsing the bitcoin wiki I stumbled across an [article about CoinJoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin). This method allows many unrelated addresses to merge inputs corresponding to each of them into one big transaction. Apart from privacy benefits, could this possibly lead to decreasing network fees for participating users? 

Something like: we gather k people who want to send bitcoin to the same address and produce a transaction with n inputs (n &gt;= k) and k + 1 outputs (k outputs to change addresses + 1 to the receiving address) instead of n inputs and 2k outputs that would be normally produced (k change addresses + k outputs to the receiving address).

 And would it be possible to somehow aggregate signatures for all the inputs coming from different addresses when Schnorr signatures are introduced?

Alex Bosworth on what the Lightning Network might look like in the future with Atomic Swaps.,"Disclosure: this podcast is Litecoin focused.

But still I believe there are a lot of take a ways for Bitcoin.  For example, Litecoin could be a way to help balance the fee networks out, in case the fees become too high on the Bitcoin network.

He also talks about how Atomic Swaps stack up against DEX's in the future and addresses some of the FUD surrounding the LN such as ""centralization"" and privacy on the LN.

- Hal Finney, March 19, 2013, 08:40:02 PM


**Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)** 

Copied from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

Will Taiwan ban Bitcoins?,"As in many other countries around the world crypto-currencies started off on the wrong foot in Taiwan. In November 2015 a wealthy Hong Kong merchant was badly beaten and then ransomed for a great deal of Bitcoins by unidentified culprits. That sparkled an immediate reaction from the head of the main securities regulator - Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) - who staunchly proclaimed crypto to be from now on ""illegal"" in Taiwan.

Soon enough this statement had been officially denounced and claimed on an inaccurate journalist's reporting. Instead of banning digital money, authorities claimed, FSC will only make sure that crypto-currencies are to be used for ""legal purposes"". General public was also referred to the joint communique issued in 2013 by FSC in a collaboration with the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan). This product of bureaucratic genius had found Bitcoin to be of the ""non-currency nature"" and tagged as the ""virtual commodity"".

That, of course, besides being plain stupid also created a legal conundrum, which is similar in nature to that, which followed the US IRS's decision to treat Bitcoins as ""assets"" subjected its to the capital gain tax. On a positive side, this short-sited decision, at least temporarily, put crypto-currencies in Taiwan outside of the immediate blast area covered by bureaucratic weapon of entrepreneurship mass-destruction.

However, in October 2017, one of the Taiwanese Central Bank's top dogs reiterated the issue, saying that Bitcoin transactions must be subjected to the intense money anti-laundering scrutiny, which, once again, placed Taiwanese crypto-community on the edge. Nevertheless, it's still very unlikely that local regulators will follow steps of their Chinese counterparts by blowing crypto completely out of the local financial pond's water.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: indifferent;
economic climate: moderately friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: many, including, FinTech, security, e-commerce, e-gaming, media, SaaS;
major limitations: sluggish economy (GDP growth rate at two percents);
stimulus: manufacturing and services constitute more than ninety percents of GDP, high-income population (per-capita over twenty-four thousands dollars), well developed infrastructure, highly qualified work-force;
opportunities: to compete with mainland e-corporations on local niche markets.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (positive).

An open letter to whales,"Dear whales,

 your shenanigans are killing the golden goose. The buy/sell wall spoofing, the wash trading, the pump and dumps, all of it. It only works when there is new money coming in, and you are scaring away the people who are thinking about getting in. You have complete control over this market, as you have demonstrated, so start acting like curators instead of con-men if you want to keep making money, otherwise, it's going to be a race to the exit at some point, and everybody, big and small, is going to get burned. 


This market could be a beautiful thing, with attractive, sustainable growth that facilitates the development of world-changing technology. This could be the new stock market, free of regulations designed to keep the little guy down. This could be the end of the debt slavery fractional reserve banking system. But instead, it is a vicious web of greed, lies and trickery, that is tempting world governments to bring the regulation hammer down and put a stop to ALL the free money.


I know you guys work together (pods?), so how about working to establish gentleman's agreements between the groups to stop trying to fuck everybody everywhere as hard as possible at every opportunity. Just slip the tip in every now and then, politely take turns at the gangbang, be gracious for what crypto has given you, and hold back a bit every now and again to give others a chance to make even a pittance compared to what you have accumulated. 


I'm not asking for free crypto money here, just please, for the love of God, give this market a chance to flourish without trying to wring every single last Satoshi out of it. 
Or at least tell us a bit of what the plan is so that we may swim along unobtrusively under your bellies. We just want to eat too, and for us even the tiniest morsel can make a world of difference.

Bitcoin will be the only encrypted currency in the world in the future,"Dorsey himself is a bitcoin investor. He expects that bitcoin will be used to buy simple things such as coffee. He also said that the advantage of bitcoin in the world currency will be realized in 10 years.
Last November, Square said it would begin to allow bitcoins to be bought and sold on its Cash applications. Dorsey is also an investor in the Lightning Labs, which is developing technology to make the use of bitcoins faster and easier.

When bitcoin was first used by people, it was touted as a substitute for the dollar, or even gold. However, in recent months, the price of bitcoin has been in a state of madness, which once surged to a record level of nearly 20 thousand dollars, and it fell 8000 dollars last month.

Dorsey said to New York Times that bitcoin is slow and costly, but as more and more people have bitcoins, those shortcomings will disappear.

cex.io verification: highly questionable ethics,"Hello all,

I primarily use Binance to trade and had signed up for a cex.io account a few weeks back and decided to go ahead and go through the verification process today, as I was interested in giving it a spin in the near future.

I went through their form and supplied the following pieces of **vital** personally-identifying information (in no particular order):

- Full name,
- Residential address,
- Driver license number,
- Social security number,
- Birth date,
- Photo of driver license,
- Selfie holding driver license, and
- Copy of electric bill.

It wasn't until **AFTER** I had supplied all this information that I received the notification that ""Unfortunately, at the moment we are not able to provide services for users residing in &lt;MY STATE&gt;."" (Yes, I reside in the US.)

I have contacted customer support (ticket 719351) and expressed just what a grave concern this is for me, and received a boilerplate response more or less repeating the same ""we're sorry, but....""

Yes, cex.io, I realize that you're ""very sorry"" for collecting my personal information **AND THEN** telling me that you cannot verify me. I don't care. You have something of mine that I **WOULD NOT GIVE** had I known **BEFOREHAND** that I would just be told that you cannot verify me.

My next move is to take this to /r/legaladviceuk, but I thought I should make the crypto community aware of this practice first.

I also see that /u/CEX_IO has a representative here so I would be very interested to see what they have to say about this.

Seriously, cex.io, **what in the world** made you think that this is good design?

BitcoinWiki org is educational and informational project about cryptoworld, it's the biggest and the first multilingual cryptowiki that don't promote or advertise anything. 

However our Twitter account @bitcoinwiki_org was banned with no warnings and our attempts to find out what we did wrong faced a total indifference from Twitter Support. We sent three emails to them but they just sent us the link to Twitter Rules like ""try to guess"". The only thing we could do is to create a new Twitter - @btcwiki

There are lots of similar cases we saw from people on Reddit. So is Twitter adopting the repressive policy toward cryptocurrency?

What are the algorithmic logic steps of mining process of bitcoin?,"I find it difficult to understand the full process of mining a block. Can you complete the following flowchart of algorithmic logic? what are the steps that should do after getting a lower hash than the target? 

1. Getting data of Version, previous blockhash, merkle root, time, bits from the blockchain
2. Concotenate all the above data and a nonce (Version + previous blockhash + merkle root + time + bits from the blockchain + nonce) --&gt; lets name this concotenated hash as ""Header_hash""
3. Convert the above header hash to binary
4. Hash the above coverted binary with SHA256
5. Hash the above for the second time again with SHA256
6. Reverse the order of the hash and name it ""Final Hash""

Let's say that we have successfully found a hash that is lowerthan the target and named it as ""final hash""

so what are the next algorithmic logic steps after this point? (steps to merge coinbase transaction etc etc)

How to take back control of Bitcoin from the price manipulatiors,"It's easy when you realize that supply and demand determines value.  All we have to do is take the following steps to ensure the price goes back to its natural rising status :

1) Buy whatever amount of BTC that you're comfortable loosing on any reputable exchange.

2) educate yourself on paper wallets, hardware and other methods for securing your own keys.

3)  Move your bitcoin off theses exchanges to address you control that the exchanges do not. 

That's literally all it takes. Remember there aren't even 17,000,000 bitcoin in existence! While it's probable that a large amount of coins have fallen into the manipulators possession, they definitely don't have them all and more and more people every day are learning about the corrupt fiat currency system and the benefits of bitcoin. As these manipulators push the price down and people wake up to what bitcoin really is they will start buying more. The anti bitcoin establishment only has so much more time before they lose control of being able to manipulate the price.",1522249666,28/03/2018 15:07:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87sna4/how_to_take_back_control_of_bitcoin_from_the/,0

"Is there a simple, independent, paid Bitcoin mobile wallet?","Let me explain my question a bit. 
For a while, I was using the free Bread Wallet as my primary Bitcoin mobile wallet. The experience was very good. Simple UI/UX, basic features only, and available both on Android &amp; iOS.
However, since a few weeks, Bread Wallet has been updated: they tokenised BRD, they added Bcash (which you can’t remove from your dashboard), they added the opportunity to buy Bitcoin directly from the app (with additional fees), etc… Which really bother me.
And I do explain this update because they actually need to MONETIZE their free application, which completely make sense from a business perspective. But as a user, I just lost a friendly and simple to use Bitcoin wallet. 

I don’t believe in free software, they will eventually tried to find monetisation in some way, and often times by diverging from their initial core value proposition : a simple &amp; reliable wallet.

So, why can’t I find a similar wallet, simple to use, UI friendly, available on iOS &amp; Android, Segwit, which is not related to some third party (BitPay, Coinbase, etc.)?

As I find absolutely meaningful to pay $20-80 for my Password Manager, or for a traditional leather wallet, I would find normal to pay for a simple and reliable wallet (with no ads, no third party connections, etc.). 
Is there that kind of wallet somewhere? If not, does someone wants to build it?

Delicious Proof that Roger Employs Sockpuppets!,"Roger has said on several occasions, very loudly and sometimes while waving his middle finger at the camera, that he absolutely does not employ sockpuppet accounts of any kind.

Besides his failed 'feed the birds' project that let anyone on his website pay others to be twitter sockpuppets, it's been hard to pin him down to actually employing them, until now.

After writing a particularly slanted article about Slush's AsicBoost news over the weekend, Bitcoin dot com news writer Jamie Redmond got called out by Bitcoin Magazine's writer Aaron van Wirdum on Twitter:

https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/977964052193468421

After Aaron called Jamie's source ""misinformed noise,"" Jamie took it as an insult and exited the argument quickly, only to pick up the conversation as a sockpuppet called 'Jonathan Herringbone.'

During that parlance, Jamie then forgot to switch his account back to Herringbone's for one response, and answered as himself, talking about himself in the third person to continue the argument:

https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/978458647490646016

To make matters worse, Jamie then deleted his post, but not before the Internet Archive took a snapshot of it:

http://web.archive.org/web/20180325235159/https:/twitter.com/jamieCrypto/status/978054447984082944

Jamie then Blocked Aaron, and followed up on the thread by claiming that he is under attack, and that Aaron is fabricating evidence against him:

https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/978676364407660545

This is Roger's Senior writer at his newsdesk, clearly an employee. If Roger wants to keep claiming he never employs sockpuppets, he'd now have to fire Jamie.

Can I still invest in cryptocurrencies despite my dad's work's investing rules?,"Hello everyone. I am a 13 year old who is very interested in cryptocurrency and technology in general. I have always wanted to invest in Burstcoin, but my father works at Morgan Stanley and he says that his company has regulations for investing that apply to everyone in a Morgan Stanley employee's household. According to him, the regulations prevent people from investing without their permission. I assume that the process to do this is pretty time consuming and I don't want to wait that long.

Knowing that Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are decentralized and are not controlled by anyone, do these rules apply? Obviously, banks like them don't like cryptocurrencies because they pretty much take away their whole job, so maybe that plays a part in their regulations.",1522263851,28/03/2018 19:04:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87ul6h/can_i_still_invest_in_cryptocurrencies_despite_my/,0

Theory: Has Bitmain been shorting Bitcoin?,"Why would Bitmain not short bitcoin especially as the price went so high in December?

Ex: Bitmain mines BTC and holds as much BTC as possible (after selling to cover electricity costs), then once the price reaches ridiculous heights (20k) they open a large short position and unload large amounts of BTC (causing the price to drop).

Result: They earn lots of cash from the sell and even more $ from their short position. Plus, it temporarily lowers the price of BTC resulting in less competition for mining (ie: nobody will want to mine bitcoin as the price is crashing)

Then once the price of bitcoin is closer to mining costs ($6-7k) they will begin to hoard bitcoin until it reaches super high levels ($100k) and then short and sell again.

I don't see why they wouldn't do this. Any thoughts?

*Here is a tweet/chart about how the ""price"" could be leashed by mining costs: https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/978658250823380993*

EDIT: Now, since BTC is around the ""Mining Price Floor"" and Bitmain has lots of cash, they will begin using their capital to invest in bitcoin start-ups (like they have been) and also potentially buying back more BTC or upgrading their mining farms. At this point they have no incentive to drive the price down further.

ALSO: $12 million dollars of BTC are mined per day. If Bitmain is half of that, then they had/have a lot of BTC (supply) to crash the price especially if they had been holding BTC throughout the 2017 price rise.",1522264511,28/03/2018 19:15:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87uoa6/theory_has_bitmain_been_shorting_bitcoin/,0

Getting 7 billion people on: long-term scaling estimates,"We currently get 7 tps x 60s x 60m x 24hrs ~ 220M transactions per year

I assume the network will learn how to get super efficient with layer 1 transactions over time. Assuming a minimum of 1 transaction per person to setup their lightning wallet, we will probably need to raise blocksize eventually by a factor of at least 10, which gets us to over 2B transactions per year.

Why didn't Kosovo financial authorities reject Bitcoin?,"Kosovo crypto-community still exists largely outside of financial regulatory boundaries. In July 2017, soon after the first Bitcoin ATM was expected to be placed right in the heart of Pristina, the Central Bank of Kosovo - Banka Qendrore e Republikes se Kosoves issued a declaration warning potential users on an absence of reimbursement guarantees associated with digital money.

This announcement was remarkably toned down compare to the great majority of similar in nature proclamations issued by mainstream finance gate-keepers all over the world. Among other things this highly unusual civil tone, used by the local banking establishment to address crypto-currencies issue, may be explained by the fact that Kosovo, without being an official member of the Eurozone, long ago had adapted Euro as its local currency.

After all, if the European Central Bank, which oversees the financial destiny of over 340 million humans, feels itself unperturbed by crypto-revolution then why shall Kosovo, with its population under 2 million, care at all?

Business Notes for Startups Founders in Kosovo:

political climate: indifferent;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: mobile, SAAS, games, FinTech;
major limitations: small, low-income population, low-tech, agriculture based economy, brain-drainage, travel restrictions with EU, absence of VC and seed money;
stimulus: fast growing young population, ;
opportunities: to built medium-sized startups on local niche markets.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (moderately positive).

Locked out of 3rd party BTC account,"I've got a unique situation and have honestly just been ignoring it for a while, not really sure what to do about it. Anyway I'll get to the point, I signed up with Xapo (a 3rd party BTC wallet) a few years ago when I was a freshman in HS. I was obviously not 18 and my membership was against the ToS, but I figured no one would know, or care. I gained an extremely small amount of $ from faucets and whatnot but the value went up significantly as time went on.

Fast forward 2 years to my parents deciding that I should pay for my own phone bill and cutting me from their plan without notice. Xapo requires 2-factor authentication so I can't get in. 

And to change phone numbers and regain access I'd need a photo of myself, with ID, and a code. But, being underage, I'm worried that I'd be denied help/service whatever because of it.

And just because things weren't complicated enough, I found an old transaction receipt in my email and managed to find my account on Blockchain. It's been sending and receiving BTC while I've had no access to it, no one should be able to get in to the account.



So please, please, please, give me some advice, I have no idea what to do, but if I could get the money in it that'd be great. I'm a senior now and it'd pay for all my college and then some.",1522288606,29/03/2018 01:56:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87xkv8/locked_out_of_3rd_party_btc_account/,3

Why can't Bitcoin retain its value?,"This is the question that so many people are asking. Why did it jump so high in value just to come crashing down? Well im not a professional by no means, but from my research and study I have my opinion.

The main reason I think it can't retain its value is- people are treating it as a stock and investment vehicle. However the true idea behind bitcoin is for it to be a digital currency. 

A currency is used to exchange goods and services, but as we all know mass adoption hasn't made it here yet so actual bitcoin transactions are minimal. Meaning a service or good was paid for in bitcoin. 

From my understanding this is how it should work...
Bitcoin as Currency
Example-i have $5000 in cash , i then purchase/convert my $5000 in cash into BTC. Then i use my btc to do everyday transactions. So lets say I buy a cheeseburger and for it in btc. The btc is deducted from my wallet and transferred to the vendor. Done its paid for. The value of bitcoin doesn't change, it only changes hands- the value still stays with-in the btc market.

However what is happening is...
Bitcoin as investment vehicle
Example- I buy $5000 in bitcoin, then 500 more people buy $5000 in bitcoin, we see a huge increase in bitcoin value, so I see my $5000 turn into $7000, so now I sell it. I walk away with $2000 of someone else's money. Now that money is taken out of the bitcoin market

The difference between a stock and btc- the stock is backed by a product that generates revenue. Bitcoin only has value from the money someone invests in it. Because ideally if it were a currency- if I'm worth $100,000 usd, and I buy $100,000 btc- my net worth doesn't change, it doesn't become worth more. I simply just transact in btc aka DIGITAL CASH

Sorry for the long rant, and I know its not well put together but i hope everyone gets the idea behind what I'm trying to explain. 

Bitcoin will never grow in value until mass adoption happens and we are transacting in bitcoin and keeping the value in the market, until then people will continue to treat it as an investment vehicle and when they see btc increase in value they are going to convert it back to usd ... Taking money out of the market.

Even for the hodlers that say they won't sell until $200,000. That's going to be so detrimental to bitcoin, why would you sell it? The idea is to use BTC over USD/other currencies, but instead you plan to sell your btc for more usd?


Once again, sorry for the rant. Please correct anything you may feel is wrong. This is just my personal view on what is going on based on my research. 

Edit- I appreciate everyone's views and feedback.

Lightning Network security,"Hi there!
I've got one little question. What if:
a) Alice (A) and Bob (B) will open a LN-channel with 5 BTC both;
b) A then sends 1 BTC to B (signs and sends to B a transaction that 4 BTC goes to her wallet and 6 to B's);
c) B sends 2 BTC to A (sings and sends to A opposite transaction: 4 BTC to his and 6 to A's);
d) B signs and broadcasts the b transaction (4 BTC goes to her wallet and 6 to B's);
Is the Lightning Network secure enought to avoid this scenario?",1522293943,29/03/2018 03:25:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87y4l7/lightning_network_security/,0

Discussion: 'HODL' vs 'Spend and Replace',"Hi everyone

Long-time reader, first-time poster. Some thoughts. I've noticed on this SubReddit, and in the discussions, people with BTC tend to be holders and not much else. I realize this is partially because of Bitcoin's amazing price movements and the desire to get rich (that's also what piqued my interest). But few seem to be pushing it for adoption as a currency.

Now that I've spent some time in the community, read some books, run a Node etc. I see this as a negative. HODL is great for market crashes but you'll never be able to see the amazing value of this technology unless you use it. It was only when I set up a mobile wallet and started buying things that I realized 'Holy crap! This is so easy. This can change the world!'. I think we'd get more lightbulb moments (and more adoption) if people promoted that. But when I speak to people, a lot of them have resistance to using Bitcoin as a currency . Seller's remorse comes up often (""what if it goes up?"").

Any thoughts?

Full disclosure: I hold lots of BTC, zero BCH, and I'm a small blocker at heart. But I do frequent BCH message boards (Silos are for suckers. I'm pro open discussion, even if it's hostile). I think the BCH community's 'Spend and Replace' mentality is better than 'HODL'. I think the scaling debate and high fees took attention away from the currency aspect. But with Segwit over 30% and Lightning in Beta, why not push for it again?

Even better than spending Bitcoin: earning it. I've been looking into ways to do this as well. Any ideas?

To those of you cashing out your BTC for fiat,"Don't forget that fiat currency is incredibly more risky to hodl in contrast to Bitcoin. True, Bitcoin's fiat valuation has been pretty volatile and we're not yet on the moon, but try to get a hold of your emotions and think more logically.


When, not if--the next economic crisis hits, it will hit hard. Not only will 2008 look like a walk in the park, but your sick gains will be lost via bank bail-ins. Scared that your BTC is losing value? You should be even more terrified that banks will confiscate our savings through legal theft in order to recapitalize themselves.


Remember Satoshi's message from the genesis block:

[""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/tx/4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b)


Never forget why Bitcoin exists.

Electrum Personal Server beta release,"Electrum Personal Server is an implementation of the Electrum wallet server protocol that allows users to point their Electrum wallet at their own full node. It is compatible resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. It is much less resource-intensive than other Electrum servers because it only stores the user's own addresses, instead of every address that was ever used. As such it makes tradeoffs, namely losing Electrum's ""instant on"" feature.

Full node wallets are important in bitcoin because they are an big part of what makes the system be trustless. No longer do people have to trust a financial institution like a bank or paypal, they can run software on their own computers. If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks for you that received payments are genuine. You wouldn't accept large amounts of cash or gold coins without checking they are actually genuine, the same applies for bitcoin.

Full node wallets are also important for privacy. Using Electrum under default configuration requires it to send all your bitcoin addresses to some server. That server can then easily spy on you. Full node wallets like Electrum Personal Server would download the entire blockchain and scan it for the user's own addresses, and therefore don't reveal to anyone else which bitcoin addresses they are interested in.

Right now using Electrum Personal Server is the easiest way to use a hardware wallet backed by your own full node. It is very lightweight, being a small python script that barely uses any CPU or RAM; much less than the full node it's connected to. Hopefully Electrum Personal Server can be part of the solution in putting full node wallets into the hands of as many people as possible.

The project is now in beta release:
https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server

It now has all the essential features to make it practical for use; Merkle proofs, deterministic wallets, bech32 addresses, SSL, Core's multi-wallet support. Along with the features that were in the alpha release of tracking new transactions, confirmations, block headers, importing addresses.

Very inspired when reading “The Internet of Money” by Andreas A.,"Just started reading this book... and holy shit how amazing and innovative bitcoin is and can be in the future. Andreas is really inspirational when educating on the history of bitcoin and money. Im not gonna lie I initially invested in Bitcoin to try to get rich quick back in December, but as we can all see the price has dipped big time. I’m not going to sell and have been holding because of the huge potential bitcoin has! 

One of the quotes in this book that has stuck with me so far: 

“If you understand that bitcoin is a technology and not just a currency, you can truly grasp the importance it has. Again, it’s not about us. It’s about the other 6.5 billion (People without banking services). It is about the ability to bring the world to a level of financial integration” 

We seem to forget that Bitcoin isn’t about the money. It’s about the other possibilities it is capable of. ",1522330779,29/03/2018 13:39:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/881bu0/very_inspired_when_reading_the_internet_of_money/,104
When does a miners start searching for nonce?,"As the title says, i'm wondering when a miner starts to look for the nonce. Does the block need to be full of transactions before it can start searching?

The importance of payment services like BitPay,"I know this sub generally dislikes BitPay, but I'm just using them as an example in this discussion.  I've seen a lot of posts and comments on this sub where people are belittling the effect of these services because they allow the Merchant to immediately convert to USD so you aren't ""really"" purchasing something with Bitcoin.

I would like to rebut that idea, and illustrate why this outlook is inaccurate.  My goal is to encourage the use of these services, both from users and merchants.

First, let's start with a use case.  A Consumer wants to purchase an item from a Merchant.  Let's expand upon this by saying that the Consumer wants to purchase the item using the currency of their choosing.  Similarly, the Merchant is interested in being payed in the currency of their choosing.  These currencies may not be the same.  This is a very important concept because it enables both the Consumer and Merchant to transact, even if they do not share a common currency.

The payment service, such as BitPay, is the facilitator of this, enabling the exchange of the two currencies for whatever the current market exchange rate is.  The payment service also provides a more subtle, but equally critical service to the economy.  That service is Volume.  Before BitPay can sell the BTC they collected from the Consumer, to convert it into USD for the Merchant, they must find someone who is willing to be the buyer - i.e. convert USD to BTC.  This implicitly helps stabilize the exchange rate of USD to BTC because higher volume generally correlates to lower volatility.

As more Consumers express interest in purchasing items with BTC, more Merchants will begin using a service like BitPay to facilitate that.  More Merchants 'accepting' BTC in this fashion automatically helps stabilize the price of BTC, even if they are immediately converting the BTC into USD or EUR or whatever other currency they need to pay their bills.  As the price stabilizes, Merchants may become more inclined to accept BTC directly, and the process inverts - Consumers paying in USD are now automatically converted to BTC.  Do note that this latter bit is years and years away - we're still very much in the early stages of something like this - see my next point.

Now, payment services like this also provide another key benefit.  They force us to reckon with all the 'sharp edges' still present within the system.  This includes things such as Ease of Use for both Merchants and Consumers, unified and safe payment features (e.g., but not specifically, BIP70) available in all wallets, and much more.  Many of these features are ""available"" today, but are not ubiquitous in all wallets or provides by all service providers, and we can only rectify that by highlighting them in real world use cases.

So, if you are a Merchant, I encourage you to begin accepting Bitcoin through one of these payment services.  It may be the case that only 1 in every 10,000 purchases on your storefront are done with Bitcoin, but you are providing a valuable and very tangible benefit to the ecosystem just by doing so - even if you're immediately converting it to USD or EUR or whatever.  If these tools and services are insufficient or simply not profitable to run (maybe the fees / training costs outweigh your margins) we need to know about that, and I would personally appreciate it if you were quite loud about that.

If you are a Consumer, I encourage you to begin spending Bitcoin at every opportunity you have to do so, even if you immediately hop onto your favorite exchange and repurchase it to refill your coffers.  In fact, please do so because you're helping to increase volume and therefore stability by doing so.  If you're having difficulty using the software, to interact with one of these payment services, we need to know about that too.

Can't afford losing your coins,"I got into this ""Bitcoin thing"" way back when. Got a hold of a whole bunch of them for next to nothing. And I'm talking about a LOT of BTC here, thousands. Eventually these things started gaining some value, being traded here and there and at one point I had nearly 10,000 dollars worth of digital money. That is, 100k bitcoins back then. That's when I started worrying about losing that much dough. Started doing my research, wondering whether I should back up my keys in the cloud, write them down in some piece of paper and hide it under the mattress, make a copy my hard drive and put it in a DVD inside a vault... But what if my computer broke down? What if the house caught fire? What if I only knew that the DVD went corrupt by the time I needed it? I can't afford losing my coins.

That's when I found out about these ""deterministic wallets"" and their ""seeds"" (that's also the day when ""My Family's Coin"" whitepaper or BIP was also born, I guess. But we'll get to that.). Anyways, one only needed to know these 12 words and wouldn't have to worry about volcanos, floods, thieves, about dying and leaving their grieving spouse empty-handed...

-Jeb, dear cousin. Here's one of my ""bitcoin words"". Could you memorize that for me? It's really important, a lot of money is at stake here. ""Witch"", that is the word, Jeb. Witch. Will you remember that in 5 years, can I count on that? Grandma knows the second word, I gave my sister the third one, uncle Georg....

-Yeah, I'll remember your damn witches, cousin. Strangest conversation I've ever had. [pause] You're not right in the head, I'll remember this crazy talk to the day I die. Now, when are you going to stop daydreaming like a damn fool and help in the farm already?

Long story short;

December 2016, I sold half of my stash and bought this tiny property in the Caribbean. Best place in the whole wide world. Sun all day, girls all night. Never went back to Alabama, never even called the bastards again. All I do, every now and then, is send some pictures of the beaches and a few postcards so these fools will know who are the idiots and who's The Man.

Big mistake. Last I heard, through my mother, is that cousin Jeb, my brother and four or five of my uncles and aunts have already colluded to put 10 of them words together. 

We ain't talking about protocol level here but can I call that a Sybil attack on my Bitcoin already? Whatever it is, thank God, the other two members of the family remain honest and loyal to my person. But the ten sons of bitches are already developing a mining strategy for their alt-coin. Looks like it's gonna be either Proof of Stake - they'll each come up with 50,000 of their own and try and buy the remaining words for 500k through bribery - or it's gonna be Proof of Work, with them buying some quantum computer prototype that will give them my remaining coins in this hostile Bcash-style hard fork of my dollars. Or should I call it ""involuntary atomic swap that will trade this brand new redneck coin for the bitcoins that very soon will be no longer mine""? 

All I know is they can't afford losing their coins.",1522344822,29/03/2018 17:33:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8837z3/cant_afford_losing_your_coins/,0

Some were saying : « it’s great, I can buy more », others were saying « it will never pass the 400$ again, hodling is a bad strategy ».
Of course, in the end, we all know who were right. 

I even found people saying : « now everyone is here to get rich, we shouldn’t pay to much attention to the price and focus on the technology » ... and this was in 2014 !

Reality check version 2018 - Just a little perspective for our short attention spans...,"A few years ago, in ""perceived"" difficult times like this, I made a ""reality check"" post that got to the top of the front page. The past few years were incredibly good for Bitcoin, as predicted, and I now feel it is time for an updated version.

It's time to get over the price bubble noise. Again.

Bitcoin is STRONGER than ever and I'll tell you why:

- Bitcoin is a solid technology. It's a worldwide, decentralized technology already 9 years old and counting doing what it does without any major interruptions.

- Bitcoin is resilient. It has been attacked multiple times, on multiple fronts, and it has not only continued existing, but it has thrived.

- Bitcoin has a scaling roadmap and, so far, it is working pretty well.

- Bitcoin is one of the least correlated assets in the world. A very attractive feature in economic turmoil times like the ones that are probably approaching.

- Bitcoin has attracted initial attention of traditional finance institutions and individuals. Many of them are starting to dip their toes in it.

- Bitcoin has MUCH LESS regulatory uncertainty than a few years ago. Several countries have passed, or are in the process of passing, regulations that legalize crypto or have made clear statements that an outright ban/criminalization is out of the question.

- Bitcoin still has ENORMOUS growth potential. Even the most optimistic surveys point out that barely 5% of the people currently owns Bitcoin (which I even think is an extremely high estimate).

- Bitcoin is still and for the foreseeable future will be the king of crypto. There are some people that say maybe Bitcoin is like the MySpace of crypto that will be replaced by a better competitor. While it is not impossible in the long term, it is clear that it is a bad comparison. The adoption barriers of crypto are much higher than the signup process for a new social network. There is simply no other crypto with as wide and geographically distributed user base as Bitcoin has today, and that is a position that is difficult to alter (even if there is a momentarily market cap inversion, which I doubt there will be anytime soon and in case it happened it would be caused entirely by price speculators/gamblers).

- Last but not least: Bitcoin is a great STORE OF VALUE*. The maths are simple and will prevail at the end. Demand is constantly rising (at times even exponentially) and supply is decreasing and capped to a known quantity. The only thing that Bitcoin has to do to maintain, if not increase it's value, is survive. And the more time it survives, the more difficult it becomes to dethrone the king of crypto.

(*Yes, I know it is down about 70% from the ATH but anyone buying BTC for the past 9 years, with the exception of the past 4 months in which an obvious bubble formed in the charts, has maintained or increased the value of their holdings)

So, just a little perspective for this apparently uncertain times...",1522347979,29/03/2018 18:26:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/883nvc/reality_check_version_2018_just_a_little/,32

Bitcoin is stronger now than it was when it was at ATH,"Two words; Zoom out. A year ago, the price was hovering over $1000. We bubbled. We rose far too quickly. That kind of rise isn't sustainable.

Lightning network is now on mainnet and is improving as each day goes by. 

Sure, the bubble has popped and yes we could see even lower prices, but realise that this digital asset has already died 100 deaths, and only comes back battle-hardened each time. 

The real MVP's are the ones with their heads in code, and others that continue to support the network. 

Price is a huge indicator, I get it but I believe that in years to come, all this misery, fud and despair will be looked at with regret, regret that these prices weren't taken advantage off. 

We've been here before, we'll no doubt go here again, but bitcoin is anti-fragile. 

There are lots of extremely influential people, family offices, hedge funds and many more invested in this. There are whales out there ready to munch your coins, getting ready for the next pump. I can't tell you when that will happen, but if history is anything to go by, it will happen when you least expect it. 

Stay strong, stay positive, and ask yourself why you got involved in this technology in the first place. If it's for short term gains, you've failed to understand the plan.

Weekly volume from localbitcoin in Venezuela has steadily risen from approx $2.4 million at the end of december to $3.4 millions at the end of March.,"I just want to say as a Venezuelan that Bitcoin has been godsend, enabling me and many other Venezuelans ex-pats to send money comfortably to our families. Before Bitcoin, eluding the currency control of the government (more like theft scheme) was usually done by sending money to an american account (which made it troublesome for those in europe) and haggling (so much haggling with people who would give 10-20% less than what was shown at dolartoday). The best part is that localbitcoin is an actual free market, so no more haggling. Bitcoin cash usually tries to lure venezuelans with tips, but simply put localbitcoin's liquidity is absolute king. Localethereum has low liquidity which translates into noncompetitive prices even when the fees of Bitcoin were around 50$ per transaction. Localbitcoincash.org has not a single offer (I actually would like some competition) so BCH must be swapped for BTC in order to access BsF (there are other ways such as AirTM but fees are ridiculous). 

I feel the weekly volume will continue rising, sadly as more and more Venezuelans leave the country and send remittances to their families. I am always trying my best to teach other expats to use bitcoins as it is the current superior way to send money, of course this may change in the future, but right now, Bitcoin has become an essential tool to a great number of Venezuelans.

The real theat to the stability of bitcoin is wall street entering bear territory,"It been a few month now that everyone is trying to find reasons to the huge decline of bitcoin, even blaming the moon or corrupted cartel.
Although I really believe that the market is very manipulated by whales and that state actors protect their intertest (like we would do) and want to tame bitcoin as it is an alternative to gold which became almost 100% state owned after 1971 to suppress people's power to sovreignty. The cultural and religious calendar of people around the world certainly affect the market. And Mt Gox sell has surely something to do with the correction.
But a few weeks ago some banks, when the dow jones took its hugest it since 6 years, had margin positions instantaneously closed with billions of net losses. Now as I cannot give sources on this you have to believe me.
What I can tell you is that my first reflex when the crypto market started to trumble, was to cash out alts to consolidate my long btc margin positions. Took a huge loss on this but anyway. I truely believe that mixed traders, wall street and bitcoin, liquidated bitcoin to prepare the stock crises ahead. 
We wanted to know what would happen to bitcoin, now that it is a real market, if wall street crash. If my analysis are correct we can assume that bitcoin crashes before wall street and that bitcoin crash is a signal for wall street turning bearish. 
I hope that this lowering of the price + the huge bullish news related to the Lightning Network and Segwit will consolidate and increase the adoption among people and not speculator, which would in the long run turn bitcoin into a safe financial space and not the speculators far west as it is now. 
If wall street actually collapse, we could see bitcoin going way lower than expected, but I don't think that mc afees predictions are absolutely unrealistic. Especially if the hashpower continues to rise. So keep hodling, trying to outsmart the market now is very dangerous, if you are not a pro trader :p",1522362691,29/03/2018 22:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/885kao/the_real_theat_to_the_stability_of_bitcoin_is/,0

Help me list Bitcoins USP's,"I was at a meetup recently titled 'Blockchain and Cryptocurrency for beginners' that had a focus on Bitcoin. A lot of people were finding it hard to wrap their heads around the tech involved particularly blockchain, to be honest I have not met a person that has 'got it' the first time they were introduced to the idea. 

Like email we don't need to know how an email works for it to benefit our lives so I started to think of what the USP's (Unique selling points) of Bitcoin are, how it will appeal to people and gain more mainstream adoption.

These are what I came up with;

**A store of Value**

**You're in control of your own money**, no one can peer into you account or impose tax levies 

**No boarders for transfers**

**No signup process, like a bank** 

**Access you funds worldwide once you have access to the internet**

**Decentralised, no central point of attack or downtime** (as an example, Instagram went down a number of weeks ago because Amazom web servers went down and no one could use their app)",1522363798,29/03/2018 22:49:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/885oq8/help_me_list_bitcoins_usps/,1

In what world can you reasonably store value if you don't know 100K is going to be worth 120K or or 30K in a few weeks?

New Crypto Boutique - Comment and win a gift card :),"Hi there,  

We've **just** launched over at [HODL.boutique](https://HODL.boutique), and we have a BTC character in our Crypto Heroes range :)

*""Wait. ANOTHER crypto shop? Really?!""* 

YES *really*. Here's what we're about... 

- Originality - Always. No boring designs here.    
- Quality - Made-to-order w/ high-end stuff. No cheap tees. (we use a blend of Polyester and Cotton). 
- Fairness - We contribute back into the development funds of each coin we use in our designs (relative to the sales), as well as giving a % of our profits to a different charity each month.

#**[Bitman (Batman) Tote Bag](https://hodl.boutique/collections/moon-collection/products/crypto-heroes-bitman-cash)**

Hope I'm okay to post here and apologies if this stuff is frowned upon - we're a small start-up who just launched about 90 minutes ago, so any way to spread the word is great at this stage :) 

We also have a HODL range (obviously), which seems to be going down well on Instagram... our only social network with any followers so far!  

If you've made it to the end of this post, **leave a comment and we'll pick one or two folks at random to receive a HODL gift card** :)

And feel free to share it with your friends or anyone else who might care. Thanks - appreciate the support. ",1522371921,30/03/2018 01:05:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/886lc2/new_crypto_boutique_comment_and_win_a_gift_card/,0

Instructions Of GAT Transactions,"Dear Users:

Hello!

We will open GAT/CNC, GAT/BitCNY trading service on Mar 30. GAT (Global AEX Token) is a digital asset based on the BTS blockchain of AEX, with a total amount of 100 billion, which is presented to users through various channels.

Status of GAT

1.The total amount of GAT is 100 billion. Current circulation is about 2.5 billion to 3 billion. AEX makes 100 million free airdrops every day (up to 12 billion in circulation).

2.GAT is distributed based on BTS blockchain, the deposit, withdraw and trading of GAT are also based on the BTS block chain.

3. 61% of the GAT that have been released will be given to users in a free way. 5% of the GAT that have been released will lock the warehouse and be held by the team. 34% of GAT could be distributed globally by giving away to other trading platforms.

4.GAT will be widely used as a global universal integral for platform applications, but its ecological construction is not yet complete. Please see below for details.


The Values and Futures

The values and futures of GAT, depends on the platform’s development and the application scenario of GAT. In order for you to learn more about GAT, we think it is necessary to explain the platform status and some future plans to you.

1. We have published the PC client for AEX. And will release APP mobile client (APP has been developed, is in the closed test phase). GAT is likely to be used for platform acceleration services for PC clients and apps.

2. We are building AEX Forum, which was established in January,2018. The AEX leadership Forum will meet with you in April. The Forum built a multi-level content system around opinion leaders. GAT will play an important role in the Forum, like members, rewards, value-added services, etc.

3. We have established a Bit World Japan Investment corporation in Japan. As the main business of the Japanese region, including the block chain investment fund and the exchange. The work of our platform is carried out on the basis of taking photos. However, there is a tightening trend in Japanese policy, and the time for completion is uncertain. But GAT will serve as a fuel for the Japanese platform.

4. We have submitted the application to MAS for approval of SFA and will complete the certification by 2018. After the certification is completed, GAT will be used as a platform fuel for our Singapore platform.

5. After the GAT opens the transaction, the currency on the platform will charge GAT for the coinage fee. It means that the digital asset team is likely to have a lot of need to buy GAT.

6. GAT will be regarded as a certificate of priority participation in AEX activities. Most of the platform's activities will be open to users with GAT. This means that users with GAT have more opportunities to get the activity rewards.

7. After the GAT opens the transaction, 50% of the platform's one-way transaction fee will be used to buy back GAT and participate in TMC dividend (replacing the original BTC dividend).

8. GAT will realize the lifting of the platform or transaction fee soon. It depends on the progress of the development.

9. We are working with multiple mines (more than 850,000T Mining) and have reached consensus. A long-term Mining Contract with market competitiveness is about to be launched. Users with GAT will receive preferential treatment and preferential purchase of Mining Contract.

10. We have reached consensus with multiple platforms. After the opening of GAT, more trading platforms will be available for circulation within the next 1 to 3 months. It means that we will try to keep the GAT flowing.

It is worth noting that we will try our best to ensure the smooth implementation of the above issues through our operation and r&amp;d team. We released the above information for the purpose of full disclosure. The above content is based on the current market, policy, operating environment of the enterprise planning. But the block chain industry changes quickly. The environment of each country has more uncertainty. We cannot guarantee the long-term effectiveness of the above content.

Can making money on bitcoin help me get cheaper health insurance?,"I'm located in the USA, and have obamacare. Currently I'm paying over $350 on health insurance a month, and not even sure if I'll make $10,000 this year... 

The rule is that you have to make a minimum amount ($12,060) to receive a subsidy. If I meet that minimum amount, I'll be able to get a lot of money back on my tax return when I file next year.

I've been trying to do some research, but I'm not a smart person.

If I buy bitcoin, and sell it and make a profit, it's considered a capital gain.

Does that mean that the money earned is considered income? Could I include the hypothetical money made to try and reach that goal of $12,060 income for this year.

Our word is our bond.  This technology is worth fighting for.  Letting the price slip into the abyss will not help bitcoin. It will delay its adoption due to the extreme volatility.   

Working together we can help change that outcome.   I hope people will spread the word to sign this pledge and hodl.

Buy slow and steady,"Bitcoin is designed to increase in value long term, but keep in mind that the price could flounder for a long time. Maybe years. The bottom is unknown. So don't leverage yourself and don't look at a new low and think ""this must be the bottom, I'm going all in."" Instead just put yourself on a steady sustainable drip of buying incrementally over time (e.g. weekly) at rate you can afford indefinitely. Then market timing does not matter. Dollar cost averaging works in your favor and you'll be such a smart investor you'll have better ideas for your gains than a Lambo.

15 mins later, I recieve another call from CIBC (same lady) stating that after she discussed with her colleagues, my account will be closed down and I will have to exit the bank and find a new financial institution. I was like WTF. I had about 3k sitting in my account and I asked if I could withdraw it. They said not at the moment until further investigation. She kept throwing around the word ""fraud"" like I was doing some fucking drug deal or crime.

Please don't get mad at me for asking this,"Most of the people only have bitcoin for its volatility, and not as a regular currency. If everyone wants to buy low and sell high, does the business of bitcoin rely almost entirely on the greater fool theory? The last few major economic crashes have happened due to businesses relying on the greater fool theory (2008 financial crisis is a major one). Why is Bitcoin different?

How much should a bitcoin be worth,"2013 is the real price of bitcoin soared year by November 29, 2013, bitcoin day on an exchange price is $1242, while at the same time, the price of gold is $1241.98 / ounce, that is to say, the price of bitcoin for the first time more than the price of gold.

We all know the story later. The price of bitcoin is rising in concussion, even though there is an occasional callback, but it still breaks through $twenty thousand. After the recent almost halved after the fall, once again climbed to $12 thousand.

What is the value of the bitcoin?

The price source of bitcoin can be understood from two aspects. On the one hand, speculators bet on bitcoin that it will become a legal currency. But from the current attitude of countries, the hopes of bitcoin to become a legal currency are rather slim. Many countries, such as Indonesia, are more willing to study their own digital currency than to legalize bitcoins.

On the other hand, the value of bitcoin is derived from the technology behind it - block chain. The essence of bitcoin is to give value to information, which is deeply rooted in the gene of block chain technology. We can also see from the naming of bitcoin that bitcoin's English can be disassembled into ""Bit"" and ""Coin"". Bit, the smallest unit of information, is a binary. It is a bit, that is, ""0"" or ""1"" in binary, while ""Coin"" is the coin. Therefore, Bitcoin is the value of information.

"""Buy"" and ""sell"" are misleading terms.","I'm well aware that a lot of people here are just interested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they want to trade them and increase the amount of fiat they have.  For these people, they see bitcoin as being no different to other commodities and therefore the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" are natural to them.

However I'd like to recommend that for those of us that *are* interested in bitcoin for reasons other than trying to make more fiat, we try to stop using these words.

I live in a country that mostly uses the Euro.  Sometimes I travel to the United States, where the US Dollar is the most commonly used currency and so it makes sense that I often need to have some.  I can of course say that from the EUR perspective, I ""buy"" and ""sell"" USD when I exchange it back and forth, but it's equally valid to say that I'm ""buying"" and ""selling"" EUR from a USD perspective.  These words are therefore misleading, since ""sell"" can mean acquiring more EUR or it can mean acquiring more USD and it requires context to determine which.  It's much clearer to simply talk about which currency I'm exchanging for which other currency.

This equally applies to bitcoin.  I don't ""buy"" BTC with EUR, I exchange my EUR for BTC.  On very rare occasions when I've miscalculated my EUR requirements and need to have some more, I also exchange my BTC for EUR, but I don't ""sell"" my BTC.

It's purely a matter of semantics, but semantics do matter.  Using the correct language helps people understand we're not talking about a commodity to be traded, but instead about a real currency.  Only once people have got that basic fact firm in their heads can they really start to understand why it's a *better* currency.  Without that understanding, no matter how well you explain the benefits of bitcoin, they likely just won't get it because they're not thinking of it as a currency to begin with (it's as ridiculous as trying to explain why the Tesla Model S is better than a Ford Focus if the other person doesn't realise it's a car and is just imagining a giant battery sitting beside your house).",1522408415,30/03/2018 11:13:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/889l3x/buy_and_sell_are_misleading_terms/,0

The Biggest Myth About Bitcoin (you believe it too),"The biggest myth about Bitcoin is the idea that it is good for bitcoin if more and more companies accept transaction in bitcoin.

No, that is not good for bitcoin at all. Quite the contrary. Here's why.

The price of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. So, what happens to supply and demand once companies start accepting bitcoin?

First of all, let's talk about supply. 

Why would a company accept bitcoin all of a sudden? It is too volatile of an asset to hold currency in. The truth is that companies only accept bitcoin because they want to increase their consumer base, and because they want some free advertisement, because they know delusional idiots on reddit will spread the news that some particular company is now accepting bitcoin.

But once the transaction is actually over and the purchase has been made, those companies will immediately convert their volatile holdings into a more secure holding, such as the dollar or the euro. Therefore, every time you make a transaction, you are basically selling bitcoin, because the company you are giving it to will be selling it afterwards. 

Therefore, supply of bitcoin **increases**. 

What about demand? Does that increase? No. Nobody is going to go rushing out and buying more bitcoin just because some random company now accepts bitcoin. You want to know why? **Because that company also accepts other currencies**. So there's nothing special about bitcoin, it's just an extra option. 

**TLDR**

Therefore, the end result is that every time a company accepts bitcoin, it will sell it after and increase supply. Since demand is unchanged, the overall effect is increased supply -&gt; lower price.

Selling after fork,"Hi

I am am holder and have coins from many years ago.

If I sell some now, hypothetically of course, do I loose access to the fork cash? I am yet to trust the ""splitting"" programs, it makes me very scared that I am literally sweating when thinking about entering the password.

So I still havent split my coins up..... If I sell some of my BTC now, and then go about splitting them later on, do I loose the amount I sold now?

Say I had 1BTC, this means I have 1btcash and 1 of the other one.... 

If I sold .5 BTC, do I loose my other bcash/etc?

If no, How can I prevent/know that I still have the cash left?

Would it be a good idea, to say, send all my btc to another, new wallet (which in itself is very hard to do in my situation, I would need to basically redownload the entire block chain on a new PC then send the BTC to it.... Would my original wallet still have the ability to access the btcash if I loaded it in a btcash application)?

I am using btcoin core by the way.... the original application ...",1522414833,30/03/2018 13:00:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88a5d7/selling_after_fork/,0

How do I send and receive?

Deflationary currencies beat inflationary currencies in the marketplace,"I have seen a lot of incorrect comments about monetary economics with people claiming things like ""inflation is necessary"" and ""an deflationary currency cannot work because people will just hoard it"".  Also things like ""money's purpose is as a medium of exchange"" or ""people use money when they trade"".

My view of money is a bit different.  I see money as a social behavior where by people use it as an accounting ledger for tracking purposes.  Someone ""uses"" money when they hold a currency for the purposes of deferred consumption.  The moment they exchange this money for goods or services should therefore be considered he or she stopping their use of the currency and is *only* possible because someone else is willing to use that currency to defer his or her consumption.

That is, in an instant the only people using a currency are those who are hoarding it in that instance.  How quickly the currency changes hands is irrelevant.  What matters is the economic demand for the currency--i.e. the number and willingness of people to hoard it.

Once you understand money this way, imagine a deflationary currency competing with an inflationary one.  Who would choose to own a currency whose value is deluded over time via monetary expansion vs one that is of fixed supply?  The outcome should be an absolute certainty for you.  We can know with complete certainty that bitcoin will be worth $1M per coin, the only question is the timing.  If the end result is known, it seems like it that people would position themselves accordingly and wait for this eventuality.  Is there any doubt that in 50 years one US dollar will be worth less Bitcoin than it can currently buy?

My opinion on bitcoin: It's pointless.,"I am well aware that this will be an unpopular opinion here, but maybe i'm looking for someone to change my mind. I've been interested in the idea of bitcoin and the technology behind it since I first heard about it years ago. Admittedly, I'm no expert on bitcoin or blockchain technology in general, but you shouldn't have to be to want to adopt it. Example - I don't have to be a mechanic to see how an automobile would benefit my life. 

Anyway, while the idea is fascinating to me, I don't really see a point. I went to business school with a focus on entrepreneurship and when it comes to ""inventing"", we were always told to create something that solves a problem. Exactly what problem is bitcoin solving? 

You might say, ""well, it's decentralized"". So what? What issue am I having with my ""centralized"" US dollar? None. Is the fear that the USD will collapse? I don't see that happening in my lifetime....but I have seen bitcoin collapse multiple times. 

Ok, well I read an article about how bitcoin is taking off in Africa because their local currencies are very unstable and prone to hyper-inflation. This would make sense to me.....again, if bitcoin were stable, but it's not. It's down 22% over the past week. Wouldn't these people have had better luck converting their money into USD or gold? 

So you might say, well it's anonymous (I'm not sure if that's even true). Again, ok, so what problem is that solving? Unless I'm doing something illegal, do I really care about this? No. The last peer to peer transaction I conducted was sending my sister $50 to reimburse her for a gift card. It doesn't need to be anonymous. I don't care if the whole world knows. I used facebook to send it. I've never sent money through facebook before and it literally took me 30 seconds with no fees. 

That brings me to my next point. Bitcoin is slow. Last week I decided to put my money where my mouth is and (attempt to) make a bitcoin purchase through Newegg. It was honestly kind of a pain in the ass. Once I had the wallet all set up, I went to coinbase to buy my bitcoin. Had to verify identity and bank account, which took a couple days and didn't feel very anonymous. Then I went to buy my bitcoin....oh, it's going to take a week before I can actually access my coins?? That's stupid. Guess what also happened in that week? Bitcoin went from $8700 to $6800. Awesome! 

Then I went to send the money to my wallet. Ok, that also takes forever. While I was waiting for it to confirm, I started reading up on the delays. I saw that during the bitcoin rush, it could take days for transactions to confirm. Also, you can pay a higher fee to have your transaction confirm faster. Ok, that's stupid. Anyway, the whole process of getting set up to buy bitcoin was annoying and drawn out and again, for what benefit? I planned on making a purchase through Newegg. I could have just used my credit card and completed the purchase in seconds. Instead, I waited weeks and ultimately decided to wait in hopes that the value of bitcoin comes back up first. Fun. 

So lets talk about the fees. I've seen people say, but the fees are so low!! Ok, well again, I sent my sister money on facebook for no fee. If I used my credit card on new egg I wouldn't have paid a fee and could actually earn 1-2% or other various rewards depending on my card. Oh, but the merchant has to pay a credit card processing fee. Yes this is true......but if I were a merchant, I would much rather pay a 2% fee than deal with the insane volatility of bitcoin. Again, as a merchant let's say I sold $9,000 worth of product and was paid in bitcoin last week. That's now worth less than $7,000. Nah, i'll pay the 2%. Also, i've seen that when bitcoin volume is high, fees go through the roof....and what if you are trying to use it at a brick and mortar store, but you have to wait 2 hours for the transaction to confirm....yeah, no thanks. 

Admittedly, I don't know much about the new lightning network. Maybe it solves the high fees and long delays, but again, what benefit does it offer versus using traditional fiat? As much as I want to see a reason, I can't, and therefore I don't see mass adoption of bitcoin happening anytime soon. I think the hype around bitcoin has mostly been based on speculation and a lot of people trying to get rich quick, but when it comes to the practicality of bitcoin, I just don't see it. 

If someone can tell me why I would ever benefit from using bitcoin over fiat (in the US) then maybe i'd change my mind, but until then I see bitcoin as a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

PSA: Bitmain is selling off our contact info to spammers,"I have a policy of using &lt;company&gt;@&lt;my domain&gt; whenever I sign up for an online account, since &lt;any address&gt;@&lt;my domain&gt; comes to my email account. This lets me track who is selling my contact information because if I receive an email from &lt;company A&gt; which has &lt;company B&gt;@&lt;my domain&gt; as the email target, I know that &lt;company B&gt; has sold/informed &lt;company A&gt; about me.

This morning, I received an email from liteBit.eu. It was spam, of course, the 'your invoice' link was a link to some vet site, nothing to do with crypto at all. The interesting thing is:

 - That it was sent to bitmain@&lt;my domain&gt;, thus telling me who sold the address

 - Also, it had the first line of the delivery address that I sent my miners to.

I co-locate my miners, and no other company has ever been given the co-location address. This puts the ball firmly in Bitmain's park.

Python script to read raw transaction and print fee rate for offline signing with Bitcoin Core,"Looking to up my security game, but I remain anxious about signing transactions offline. The problem is that it is hard to check a transaction to see what the transaction fee is so that you can be sure you are not sending more than you intend to miners.

I'm looking for a simple python script that will read an unsigned raw transaction, and query an instance of bitcoin to figure out how much fee is being paid.

Might write this myself by converting [Rusty's code](https://github.com/rustyrussell/bitcoin-storage-guide/blob/master/offline) but I wanted to see if it's already out there.

Straight down since introduction of Futures - thanks Wall St,"I read a lot of posts back when futures were introduced on CME.  A lot of folks called out this was an escape hatch for those whales holding large positions that needed to cash out legitimately where there is sufficient liquidity.

My guess is that is what has happened.  If you held $1 million in BTC in foreign crypto exchanges, getting that money out into cash isn’t so easy.  But u can leave it there and instead sell the equivalent of your position using options on a futures exchange, netting it out to cash out...

My online shop is now accepting Bitcoin!,"Hello Friends!  

Wanted to stop by and tell you my online shop, [whitelabeljuiceco.com](https://whitelabeljuiceco.com/) is now accepting Bitcoin for orders!
  

I first got into Bitcoin after a dream I had last May and it has changed my life forever.  Ever since then, I have been completely obsessed with cryptocurrency while maintaining a healthy level of Bitcoin maximalism. Currently in the process of setting up some BTC ATMs in the San Diego area, and have been inspired to teach myself to code so I can hopefully be involved in supporting BTC in the future.   Currently set up to use Coinbase Commerce, but am researching setting up our own lightning network payment channel hopefully soon :)  

My plan is to HODL 100% of payments made in BTC for the foreseeable future.  

I founded this company in August of 2014 with the intent of producing a high quality product on par with what was being offered at the time but at a fraction of the cost.  Our products are manufactured in our ISO class 7 clean room in San Diego, CA and do not contain any extra additives such as sweeteners, food coloring, etc.  Don't want to go into too much detail here but if you are a vaper, check us out some time if you want to SPENDL some BTC on some real-world products!  

We have a coupon code for Reddit users as well which is REDDIT10!

"If someone says ""Bitcoin is a solution looking for a problem, it doesn't solve any problem"", THIS is the only answer.","I see this brought up here all the time and people just keep giving some made up problems that Bitcoin is supposed to solve. They're all wrong.

Bitcoin was invented to solve one problem, that's it. Since computers were invented, nobody was able to solve this problem.

Satoshi made laid it out there plain and simple in the main abstract of the front page of the Bitcoin white paper. Bitcoin solved a problem called the **Double spending problem.**

In a nutshell: 

*""The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.""* - Satoshi Nakamoto

In the computer science world, it was thought impossible to have distributed consensus without a trusted third party. This is why, before Bitcoin, there has never been a successful digital value transfer mechanism that was also peer to peer and decentralized. We never had a native internet payment protocol because nobody could solve the double spending problem.

*""We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU proof-of-worker. As long as a majority of CPU proof-of-worker is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure.""* - Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin White Paper Abstract, 2008.

That's it. That's the simple and true answer. ",1522427835,30/03/2018 16:37:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88boyp/if_someone_says_bitcoin_is_a_solution_looking_for/,7

I hope you guys know what reverse psychology is,"Because it is definitely happening in times like this. You have to understand that many even real ""fans"" of bitcoin will come out in times like this and try to spread some ""FUD"" and as you can see we already have some weird posts on the front page and that's tells you is real. Keep in mind that many many (including me) missed on ""cheap"" bitcoin and many people are praying that it would totally crash so they could get in at lower prices. 

This is how it works, they ""bash"" it now but as soon as they are in they start cheering.

There is lot of manipulation going on especially from whales....I just hope you are holding and not trading in times like this because they will fuk you up. HODLING is easy (if you didn't sell house for it of course), most safe and on long term always the best option ! 
 
Happy Easter !

Nobody Sees It,"No one knows how the market FUD works exactly. 

Let’s put it in parody form as I’m rolling this from another post someone made: 

Quick everyone Bitcoin is going down to ZERO sell now and get out while you can! 

Everyone sells the price goes down. Who owns all those bitcoin you just sold? A jackass or some very sophisticated people? 

It’s the latter. 

I’ve said this each and every single time and I got yelled at and called a coon for saying it. 

So the price of stocks or tokens go up after some people buy all that shit up and then raise the price bc they have a monopoly on the supply. 

Everyone collectively has a monopoly on the supply and the price. So what’s the difference if everyone raised their own prices and sold at their dream price per token VS like 10 whales in the market doing the same thing?

Will a significant price drop enable a 51% attack?,"In theory and in practice, bitcoin's large and distributed hash rate protects it against a majority (""51%"") attack. Assuming a marginal cost model, the current hash rate is governed by the miner whose mining cost is equal to the expected reward, the latter depending on the bitcoin price and the difficulty.

The difficulty, i.e. the expected reward for a given hash rate, is adjusted every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), so that the block time is kept roughly constant. In times of fallen prices, this delayed response could lead to a runaway scenario where, if the value of the expected reward falls below the marginal (electricity) cost of a large fraction of miners, the hash rate falls sharply.

One corrective could be that, when mining grinds to a halt, skyrocketing transaction fees increase the reward per block, and hence the incentive to mine. However, this assumes that demand for on-chain transactions remains high enough.

With the current distribution of marginal costs, is there a good estimate for how much the bitcoin price will have to drop within a two-week period for mining to become unprofitable for a large fraction of miners, and for the hash rate to fall so sharply, that a small fraction of the (still available) capacity is sufficient for a majority attack?",1522436744,30/03/2018 19:05:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cui9/will_a_significant_price_drop_enable_a_51_attack/,0

Blockchain/Crypto Adoption Effects vs Today's Market,"Calling all opinions and viewpoints! 

1) With different companies filing for patents with a basis on blockchain technolog, in your opinion, how will that affect the cryptocurrency market as they roll out? i.e IBM, Cisco 

2) If a top tier company like Alphabet for example, comes out with their own blockchain and with it their own currency or utility tokens then how does your opinion change of the market and existing competing currencies? Understanding that it would be much easier for the company to simply adopt an existing working product at that point is a given but some big players like to have everything ""in house"" (Amazon, Tesla, etc)

3) What are your takes on the criticism by the general media that blockchain technology is the gold mine of the future but not cryptocurrency per say? (X company in the stock market adopting blockchain technology is the future but cryptocurrency use is outrageous)

4) According to the United Nations last year, most of the world still does not have internet access. Of course the number of people online is expected to only go up every year but how do you feel about this as an additional bottleneck to adoption of cryptocurrencies in the grand scheme of things in the world?

BTC has the potential of becoming a competitor to gold, which has a 8T$ market cap. No, it’s not guaranteed - but it has a true chance. Guess what, the world is becoming more and more digital and BTC is until now apart of that revolution and obviously has the potential to continue doing so.

Relax and think long term.

In 2020 another halving is coming and all coins (21M) will be in circulation by 2140 approximately. Well all be dead by 2140.....

Some important factors that theoretically could affect the space:
- stock prices are at an ATH. Market is over bought and inflated. If the stock market crashes money surely will go in to crypto. Some people disagree on this, but only time can tell.
- a lot of countries around the world are at political and economical unrest.
- the US has 21T$ in debt, not sustainable. This will implode at some point.
- China has recently started to purchase oil with Yuan instead of dollars. This will affect the dollar in the longer term as dollars will be removed from the market.
- the EU is fucked, brexit - and most likely more countries will follow and exit during the next decade. 


In the past I’ve seen a lot of post about people saying that BTC is to expensive and that the whales are manipulating the market etc. Yes they are, as they do in all markets. As soon as BTC becomes more liquid it will be way less volatile.  But we won’t see that before 1-2T$+

Mining expenses are going one way, up - they have grown exponentially since the very beginning. If someone reinvents the wheel, yes, they might make a huge mining profit short term. But after some months other companies will be creating similar chips and hash rate will sky-rocket: hence, mining profits go down and miners won’t sell before break even or threat of bankruptcy.

After the next halving in 2020 a total of 328125BTC will be added to the market per year, that’s a total of approx 27K per month.

In 2024 a total of 164 062BTC will be added to the market, a total of 13.6K per month.

2028 a total of 6.8K per month.

2032 a total of 3.4K per month.

Do the math, use your logic.

And on my last note, Switzerland is the crypto place to be. The whole government is supportive of bitcoin and Blockchain. Their national bank had a profit of 55$B in 2017. Don’t think their buying BTC behind the scenes? Think again! Would they be stupid enough to announce it, of course not.

Hold and relax, wether it’s real estate, BTC, valuable art, your wife, pension fund. Aim for a good life now and aim for a comfortable life when you get older, be smart!

All the best!

EDIT: 
- receiving extreme amounts of BS for spelling mistakes. I hate to break it to you, but I’m not a native English speaker.
- no, the stock market is not at an ATH, it’s just below. The bull run since 2008 has been incredible.
- the last part about the Swiss banks is a guess and somewhat conspiracy theory. You cannot deny the likelihood of banks investing in crypto in the coming years. In my opinion the odds are highest for the banks in countries that are crypto friendly.

I have created a terminal crypto portfolio and ticker. Any comments to improve it will be appreciated.,"[Tickly](https://github.com/derkomai/Tickly) is a terminal crypto portfolio and ticker that gets data directly from the exchanges API. It works under GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows (through Ubuntu terminal) and updates in real time.  It is written in Python and uses ncurses for the interface.

Some of the *advanced* data (high 24h, low 24h, change 24h) is still buggy but the basics work quite good already. I'd appreciate any comments or errors you can get. The implementation is quite naive for now, but at least I got it working. Everything is better explained at Github.

"When hoarders of gold die, their stash is found.","So I'm thinking. There's a limited amount of BTC available.

People hodling BTC may hold for so long that they unfortunately pass before exchanging/using it. What happens to it? 

If said person was holding gold that gold would fall into possession of next of kin or the bank or whoever clears the house or the bank after your lease on a safety deposit box runs out. But generally somebody will take ownership of said gold with it being a physical thing. 

Cold storage could be redeemed by somebody who understands it. But any kind of digital wallets would be in purgatory forever meaning even less BTC on the market right?

Experiences with Bitmex testnet?,"Have been playing with Bitmex testnet and leverage. Was hoping to take advantage of BTC swings to test/figure it out. Couple questions:

- Does Bitmex testnet even work? It doesn’t seem to calculate or store and profits or losses? PNL and account balances don’t update for winning and losing trades, so is still a mystery...

- Whats the point of leveraging a trade 2 - 100X and risking liquidation if real ROI is still only based on what you put in? Just use your normal exchange, sell high, buy back lower.

The only informative pages online are Bitmex itself and affiliates (blogs getting commission for signing up new members).

Why I will HODL till the end.,"I have never been the popular one, the handsome one, or the smart one. I've always been ridiculed and ostracized for my taste in clothes, music, books, and my penchant for pinching girls' butts and running away giggling. Through my life, I've suffered innumerable name-callings, such as ""pervert"", or ""molester"" or ""creepy molester.""  

Now I'm 68 years old, and run a local carwash. I still get ridiculed occasionally for pinching girls' butts and scuttling away, and I've been jailed three times. But that's OK. I've accepted that this cruel, insensitive world is just what I live in. 

But in December, when I saw Bitcoin burst onto the scene, I felt for the first time a surge of hope, of power, of rejuvenation. Banished from my mind were the days of being taunted and marginalized. I was ready for my turn to rise to center stage. 

I mortgaged my house and poured all of my savings, retirement, pensions, etc., into BTC. For once in my life, I will taste wealth. I will taste success. I will get my millions. I will get respect. Never again will I be judged by my looks, my taste in fashion or my predilection for copping a feel. Instead, I will be be judged by my character and achievements alone. 

So, my dear fellow dreamers, my legion of misunderstood miscreants, HODL. I repeat, HODL. HODL so that once in your life, you can know what it's like to be king! HODL till the end.

The question: Next summer I will be travelling from europe to the US and I will be staying there for a few months. I wanted to take my bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) with me, either with a Ledger or an USB stick, depending on which one is better suited. 
Now, I know that if you carry more than 10.000€(?) with you, you are required to announce it to the border control. Does anyone have any experience with bitcoin though? Is it safe to take it with me in a HW wallet? Do I have to tell the border control how much ""money"" I am having on the USB stick?

Thought: Satoshi private key is owned by two or more people,"Satoshi created Bitcoin with decentralisation in mind, avoiding that one single person or party has control over it. Satoshi probably wanted to avoid a situation where a single person would have full control to the private key (single person = centralised).

To avoid this situation for security reasons and to keep himself sane from moving any coins, access (control) to the private key has been spread over two or more people: key-holders. Only if all key-holders come together with their part of the key, they can unlock the full private key. This is like the DNSSEC Root Signing Ceremony where 7 key-holders must combine their keys. At least 3 key-holders are required to unlock some of the safe deposit boxes.

If Satoshi was a single person and wanted to keep access to his private key, he probably did something to avoid the situation where he, as a single person, would have full control over it.

Any thoughts on this?",1522500564,31/03/2018 12:49:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88ieut/thought_satoshi_private_key_is_owned_by_two_or/,0

"If everyone buys low, won't whales get rekt?","So we know there is serious manipulation going on. At any time the whales want they can dump over 100 billion and tank the market cap to 300-350 billion.

Their strategy is to inject fake confidence by buying up tons of BTC and keeping it stable at high levels. Their goal is to get everyone to buy high, before they sell everything to low levels, creating panic and buying up cheap BTC in the process with small fake pumps.

So Im thinking, if everyone ONLY buys with fiat when market cap reaches 350 billion and sells when cap reaches 460 billion, won't we theoretically win over the whales?

Is bitcoin futures volume driving ordinary markets? (“taming BTC” and the effects of futures of commodity markets..),"Can ordinary trading of a “classical asset” be manipulated by FX exchanges? 

Once the futures market volume is higher than the regular spot market, general notice leans towards FX markets for direction. 

Marginal traders (and short term price) are looking to the FX tickers to indicate whether it’s a bear or bull market. A bad actor with ""unlimited access"" to fiat (i.e. BIS or federal reserve or their agents) can control those FX markets with taking both sides of bets.

This is what happened to gold in the 70ies (and looks like the current bear Bitcoin chart). Or any other traditions precious metal commodity market.

Fundamentally though BTC is different, not in scarcity, but is use case, and its lack of being manipulable with “fractional” issue like being done with unredeemable paper gold (though the futures contract appears similar).

Theory: institutional high volume traders (marginal trading) move from buying the actual asset (Bitcoin) into partial alt coins, and futures (all types). Hence suddenly stopping trading the actual asset (Bitcoin), that then suffers from a decline in interest, which again influences the other dependables (alts, futures..).
 
Please comment on the level of BTC/USD FX volumes compared to regular markets 4-6 B USD/ day. (for ex Bitmex having 3-5 Billion USD daily.. CBOW and CME seems much lower)

"I'm making a simple Windows application that can read trade histories from ""any"" exchange","For a while now I've been working on a little project. I call it *Crypto Trade Manager*.

The main purpose of the application is to read trade history files in a *generic* way. I first 
started implementing functions for importing export files from specific exchanges, but then I
realized there are way too many, and they all look somewhat similar.

The way Crypto Trade Manager works, is that the user defines the format of the trade history file 
he wants to import. This can be done by filling up a form with different parameters in the UI of
the application (which is a little time consuming). Once this form is completed, and the
trade history has succesfully been imported, the user can save the parameters to a file.
This file can then be used later for importing trades from the same exchange.

I wouldn't say the application is 100% complete, but I would like to release a version to the community.
I hope some people here would like to try it out, and give some feedback (negative and positive).
I still have a bunch of features I want to implement, but I need some opinions from users if I will continue on this.

Some the features implemented now:

* Import of trade histories using UI form or input file
* Manual Add, Edit, Delete, Convertion of Trades, Desposit and Withdrawals
* Tabular overview of all transactions
* Tabular overview of portfolio/holdings over time (automatically calculated based on trades)
* Current portfolio (automatically calculated based on trades)
* USD value of portfolio over time based on CoinCap.io data
* USD value of porfolio based on CoinmarketCap data
* Graphical plot of porfolio value over time (automatically calculated based on trades)
* Everything (almost) can be exported to excel (or copy/pasted directly from tables)

I made a very simple website where you can download the application:

* www.cryptotrademanager.org

I've started on User Guide on the website (not completed), but a video says a 1000 words, so I made:

* Short introduction video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpVgpsJ8GOU&amp;

* Long introduction video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBszOXjSNDs&amp;


Lastly, I need to mention, I'm not a developer. Programming is more of a selflearned hobby.
There are probably still a bunch of bugs which I haven't encountered yet. This is also why I
hope some of you would like to try it out and give feedback.

Thank you all!


**TLDR:**

* Windows application, manage &amp; import any trades, download here: www.cryptotrademanager.org/downloads.html

* Video tutorial short: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpVgpsJ8GOU&amp;

* Video tutorial long: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBszOXjSNDs&amp;

* I want feedback, please try, thank you!

Hypothetical Bitcoin Mining Question...what would you do?,"**Disclosure + fundamental premises:**  

* I already own 5+ coins at an average of just over $10K each.  
* Further, as a general proposition, I don't believe BTC will be surrendering first mover and adoption advantage any time soon.  
* In general, I have a positive mid and long term (10+ year) outlook on BTC.  

**Hypo**  

Given the above; if you had the capital and the time available, would you launch a small-ish (5-10 ASIC units) BTC mining operation?  

Why or why not?

Lesson - Why Bitcoin's fiat price is irrelevant?,"I've mentioned before that I'm an old hand when it comes to Bitcoin but while it was nice to see the surging 'interest' in Bitcoin towards the end of last year, I was keenly aware that Bitcoin's utility had not scaled in proportion and the price was driven solely by institutional interest.

Retail interest is manipulated by institutional disposition towards Bitcoin. They own the media. They own your psyche, your thoughts, your decisions.

'What do you mean by institutional disposition?', you ask? Nation states and their banks.

If you think fiat price matters, I only have one question. What is Bitcoin to you? If the answer is 'a speculative asset to print new bank money', you should get the hell out of here and head over to the stock market.

The world we live in today is not a far cry from feudalism, even in so-called democracies, however much we are brainwashed into believing the polite fiction that is force-fed to us.

Banks are our feudal lords, each nation-state a fiefdom and every common man a serf. They print money out of nothing, inflating the economy and we keep paying interest on nothing, all the while diminishing the purported value of the money we hold which was created from nothing.

Why does nothing have value at all? Because we endorse this paradigm. Borderless currency is bad news for this paradigm.

Now let me tell you what Bitcoin really is,

Bitcoin is a new economic paradigm, where, for the first time in the history of money, every man gets to live in a truly democratic society with economic autonomy.

Bitcoin is not an asset that has value in bank money. Bitcoin is here to destroy bank money. Bitcoin is the everyman's money.

Bitcoin's true value will be its own purchasing power. How will Bitcoin have purchasing power? The same way bank money obtained purchasing power.

We just need to endorse this brave new paradigm. 'We' does not include banks or nation states, but we, the people!

Bitcoin is ingenuity. Satoshi is to Economics what Darwin was Evolution and Galileo to Science.

Most of us are just too benighted and brainwashed to appreciate the power of Bitcoin.

What would happen if we all ditched the bank money they keep printing out of nothing at will and bought into Bitcoin?

Question: Did fee free trading with Robinhood app hurt bitcoin or help?,"Free is usually good however it can be unhealthy in some areas of markets. Taking away fees gives less incentive to HODL when you can drop all currencies at any moment for no reason. 

Could serious manipulation be going on with this?",1522539348,31/03/2018 23:35:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88mnjn/question_did_fee_free_trading_with_robinhood_app/,1
