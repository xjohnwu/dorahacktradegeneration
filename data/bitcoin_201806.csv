"What happens if you create an offline transaction sending change back to your same address, but you receive more funds in between the time you broadcast it?","1. Your address has 1 BTC on it
2. You create an offline tx that sends 0.5 BTC to someone and 0.5 BTC back to yourself
3. You sign the tx offline
4. Meanwhile 1 BTC comes into the same address before you have a chance to broadcast it
5. You broadcast the tx

"Trezor vs alt-hardware-wallets: which one have you used, what are your experiences, which one would you recommend and why?","To all these people around me holding a little Bitcoin and asking me how to secure them I always recommend the Trezor. I am aware of the fact that running an offline machine for cold storage is most probably an even better idea but this is nothing most people would want to have to put up with. 

I have written a book about Bitcoin years ago in which I recommend Trezor (https://www.amazon.de/Bitcoin-kurz-gut-J%C3%B6rg-Platzer/dp/3955616509) but then Trezor was the only hardware wallet around at the time. I have come to realize though that by now many people are using other hardware wallets and in an update to that book I might consider them.

Hence my question: does any of the other hardware wallets that came after Trezor compete with or even outcompete the first mover and why do you think so?

Thanks for your input!

📚5 things you didn’t know you could buy with bitcoin🔻,"One of the biggest hurdles with any alt-currency is knowing what exactly you can do with it. However, the more established bitcoin becomes, the more retailers and businesses will be willing to accept it as a legitimate currency. Here are five things you probably didn’t realize you could buy with your bitcoins.
 
1️⃣Gift cards
At sites like Gyft and eGifter, you can purchase gift cards for all sorts of retailers that don’t formally take bitcoin yet.
 
2️⃣Pizza
We knew bitcoin was for real when we first found out you could buy pizza. PizzaForCoins has been around for a while, allowing you to place orders for various pizza chains through their website and paying with your bitcoin.
 
3️⃣Airline/hotel/space flight tickets
Surprisingly, big companies like Expedia and CheapAir now accept bitcoin directly through their websites for hotel reservations and airline tickets. You can even go to space with bitcoin through Virgin Galactic.
 
4️⃣Computers
In 2014, Dell announced that it would be accepting bitcoin through its online retail store, making it the biggest company at the time to do so.

Now  that it has came such a long ways, has more users, and is much more mature, what is its uses that aren't so secretive, subversive, or facilitating crime? 

I've used it to buy grilled cheese and pizza locally, but apparently bitcoin isn't *really* for buying coffee, so I'm just curious what it's used for that isn't undermining society, like breaking laws or hiding information from people.

🔥4 Reasons to Invest in Bitcoin This Year🔥,"Yes, Bitcoin price has lost almost 70% of its all-time highs. But the technology itself continues to develop, becoming stronger than ever! Here are 4 main aspects which help Bitcoin to remain a wise way to invest (despite of any corrections). 
 
1️⃣Transactions fees have dropped to their lowest levels in seven years 
Not since 2011 was it was so cheap to use Bitcoin, and it promises to become even cheaper in the future. Increasing expansion of the Lightning Network is expected to push fees below 1 satoshi per byte, so long-term transaction would cost nearly negligible amount.
 
2️⃣Bitcoin’s hashrate climbed to its largest in history in May
Data from Blockchain republished on Twitter by trader and commentator CryptoYoda impressed users with theories including miners mining at a smaller profit in order to generate long-term holdings.
 
3️⃣SegWit transactions
This year witnessed mass uptake of Segregated Witness (‘SegWit’) technology, which for Bitcoin users also means lower fees and faster confirmation times. SegWit transactions now make up a greater proportion of the total sent each week than ever before – almost 40%.
 
4️⃣Worldwide bank system lacks trust
Italy and the Eurozone under political pressure and Australia and New Zealand lenders both suffering mass technical outages which cut customers off from their funds. By comparison, the Bitcoin network has experienced 99.9923% uptime since it was launched in 2009. Decentralized cryptocurrency becomes more and more attractive for investors, and that means, that Bitcoin market cap is destined to grow!",1527845353,01/06/2018 09:29:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nqki1/4_reasons_to_invest_in_bitcoin_this_year/,1

PoW for delay tolerant networks on consumer devices,"1) Can the PoW algorithm be rewritten to be more egalitarian and ""device-aware""? The system currently has it's weaknesses. One is rapid consolidation... as most mining power today is provided by “pools”, big groups of miners who combine their computing power to increase the chance of winning a reward. I was thinking that perhaps, maybe based on the device that the mining client is run on, the mining difficulty should be adjusted dynamically. This would effectively ""decentralise"" mining as every node has an equal opportunity to validate transactions. 

2) Is PoW suitable for delay tolerant networks? For example, in a theoretical situation where node connectivity is limited, can a miner node collect pending transaction data, go offline, solve the associated mathematical puzzles, and then only go online to broadcast the solution to the network in order to preserve data usage. I presume that the issue here would be that an individual with “always on internet” might stand a better chance than someone with an intermittent connection of earning newly minted coins. But latching onto 1), I am thinking of a situation where a user has 3G/4G connectivity on a mobile for limited periods of time in a developing country.",1527845777,01/06/2018 09:36:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nqlmj/pow_for_delay_tolerant_networks_on_consumer/,1

Merchants Adoption,"In a crypto market where ""bitcoin price can go down to $100 or reach $100000"" and ""never invest more than you can loose"" would merchants adopt crypto and hold it after sales of products and services or seek solutions that instantly exchange the crypto for fiat?   
I presume that small businesses for both services and products sales could hold some crypto, but i'm not sure about bigger businesses, specially ones that sell products. A possibility of getting hit by a long crypto bear market could seriously damage their business.
I think the only options for instant crypto to fiat transfer for merchants is done through exchanges only and sometimes merchants are being denied such services or are being canceled after a while. 
At the moment crypto investors don't have many options to spend crypto and buy it mostly because of hype and hope for a profit. If options for spending crypto were abundant it would create a lot more hype and crypto awareness which would favor greatly the crypto price, but at the same time people wouldn't ""HODL"" as much anymore which could affect the crypto price negatively.

Bitcoin blockchain size on mini-blockchain scheme,"At the time of writing (Friday 31 May), according to BitInfoCharts (https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/), the current size of the Bitcoin blockchain is 199.48 GB. If Bitcoin were to ""theoretically"" adopt the mini-blockchain scheme (http://cryptonite.info/wiki/index.php?title=Mini-blockchain_scheme), and as a result, trim all of the ""bloat"" on the blockchain, what would the size of the Bitcoin blockchain be today?

I have been told that the easiest way would be to get the total number of UTXO and multiply it with the average UTXO size. But this is a naive calculation. Going by this logic according to this website: https://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/unspent-transaction-output-set, it would mean the blockchain size would be ~2.7GB. Is this correct?

r/Bitcoin recap - May 2018,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I’m back with the seventeenth monthly Bitcoin news recap.


For those unfamiliar, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in bitcoin over the past month.


You can see recaps of the previous months on [Bitcoinsnippets.com](http://bitcoinsnippets.com/)

Online bitcoin script simulator?,"I've got a copy of ""Mastering Bitcoin"" and I wanted to learn some scripting.  

I'm having a heck of a time setting up a node following the book's instructions however.  To be honest, I'm just sick of fighting with it at this point.  It's not like I want to actually run a node, I just want to learn to script...

I also don't want to kill our office's poor little wireless router or rack up a bill for data as I download a full copy of the blockchain.  

Any suggestions for an online simulator where I can run commands?  Google was slightly helpful, but I'd appreciate any suggestions.",1527856610,01/06/2018 12:36:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nrjg7/online_bitcoin_script_simulator/,1

Objectively....is it over?,"Hey there, before I start and see a sea of red downvotes, just barre with me here.

I am NOT asking if tomorrow, is the market going to crash out and we all are left with nothing. I am still in a very green position but I have my doubts about the sustainability of the over 1600 cryptocurrenices currently available.

Another disclosure: I am absolutely long on the technology and concept that is blockchain, but as you know, that does not mean that I am necessarily long BitCoin. I am just curious about where people think the market, as a whole, is headed over the next say, 1-3 years.

Looking forward to reading some opinions.",1527864116,01/06/2018 14:41:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nsd84/objectivelyis_it_over/,1

Today I created a channel, I killed a lot of time and effort in creating it.

Help: Bitcoin Core does not auto start in Ubuntu with -datadir option,"Please can someone help me out?

I have installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox to host Bitcoin Core. In VirtualBox I assigned a special disk with the blockchain. I am however new to Ubuntu. I am a Windows crack.

When I start bitcoin core from a terminal command prompt like:

`bitcoin-qt -datadir=/media/,username&gt;/Blockchain`

then Bitcoin core starts correctly. ""\&lt;username\&gt;"" is my  username to login to Ubuntu. ""Blockchain"" is how the disk is named in VirtualBox. The host system is Windows 10.

However when I configure this command in the 'startup applications' of Ubuntu to start bitcoin core automatically when Ubuntu starts, I get the error message the path cannot be found.

While I am writing this post, I think it may be possible Ubuntu did not logged me in under username \&lt;username\&gt; yet when auto starting bitcoin core, but this is a wild quess.

Is there an Ubuntu crack who can help me out please?",1527922647,02/06/2018 06:57:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nywrj/help_bitcoin_core_does_not_auto_start_in_ubuntu/,1

Got some real money in BTC? Make a backup of your hw wallet BEFORE you need to,"Just some sane advice, this time without a horror story to make the point :0)

If you put some real money in BTC, what exactly is that amount when talking about 'real' will depend on you, we all should know to use a hw wallet..
But how many have actually tried there seed to restore their wallet?
What if your wallet gets lost, broken or what ever, and you need to access your funds quick?

My advise; buy a second hw wallet form the start, check your seed on the second wallet after the first small deposit.
Only then proceed with putting more money into it.

Please also store your seed and backup hw wallet save.
For me safe means both separate, in a fire proof safe.

If one is afraid of robbery, you can make a decoy wallet, on my ledger I can.
Also in that case put the decoy seed as the easy to get and the true seed really hard to find, use your imagination..

If you go this way I think you need to go all the way...
Don't tell your partner, kids, or for that matter anyone how much you have, or that you use such a decoy wallet. 
Under real pressure most will crack and start shouting things to you like ""please just give them all we have"" or whatever. 
And with you or a family member at point blank of a gun it will be hard enough to keep your sense and only give them your decoy wallet or seed.

While we're here put at least some convincing money in the decoy wallet..., with a lambo on the drive way do you think they will settle for that hundred or a thousand buck?

Are we talking about big money, that would be for investing and thus not needed to access quickly?
We are putting it in several hw wallets, stored at different locations and again we haven't been bragging about the amount or these different locations.
Again we have checked the seeds to work and stored these save.

To be honest I just recently made my hw backup wallet.
I guess just like most I started small but after a year realized it was becoming some real money I had put in. And it does feel better now I know I have made some preparations for losing my hw wallet or worse.

Want to be your own bank? 
Then be it!

"School assignment, quick survey about cryptocurrency.","Hi everyone,

I'm currently in high school and making my final assignment for economy. We had to research something that we were interested in and I chose cryptocurrency/blockchaintechnology because the potentials with it are pretty exciting. After researching and writing up an essay we had to interview someone about our subject. The final step is conducting a survey so here I am!  
The survey contains very simple questions you can finish under 5 minutes, if you are interested in taking it click the link down below. It's a link to my Google Forms survey.

Thanks in advance!

"""Advantages of buying artwork and commissions with cryptocurrencies"" - I would like feedback and critique to make this better. How is my argument?","Has anyone considered accepting BTC for commissions, and even commissioning artists with cryptocurrencies? As artists, and the clients of artists, we need something efficient that will also protect our interests. I believe that cryptos have a good future with the art world and our merchants, and here is why.

**Advantages of cryptocurrencies over paypal (for both buyer and seller)**

**1. International, and can be used anywhere, esp in countries not served by paypal**

For example, say that you are an American and you use the USD, and you have an artist in Ukraine that you want to commission. However, Ukraineans cannot accept payments through paypal. An easy way to solve this would be to use bitcoins, which is legal and accepted worldwide with no middlemen.

**2. Anonymous for both buyer and seller (good for porn artists, lolis, furry, ryona, other ""questionable"" art niches)**

A lot of artists draw things that we may not want the whole world to know, let alone have it attached to our personal lives and our names. Same with clients who buy commission from artists.

**3. No middleman with draconian rules (like paypal against porn, for example)**

When you use cryptos, you answer to no one. You can buy whatever you want, and sell whatever you want. Sell all the loli furry commissions you want, and no one will be the wiser. You don't need a middleman giving you terms and conditions for using their service. You have your own wallet that you can do whatever you want with. It's truly a peer-to-peer transaction.

**4. Lower fees**

Middlemen take a certain percentage for you to use their service. If you have your own crypto wallet, you only pay the ""mining fee"" (or gas fee, transaction fee, depends on the cryptocurrency) to a miner. However, this is STILL lower than what paypal charges. I will show you an example, where an artist charges $50 for a sketch commission:

[image](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRc5qLZ4RqrnKmkZrXnFJdVPn2owmg7k3wcz9y4K7aq9L/paypal%20vs%20btc%20fee%20difference.jpg0

In this picture, it shows that if an artist charges $50 for a sketch, paypal will take $1.75, while if he used bitcoin, he'd only be paying a transaction fee of $0.12.

**5. Faster confirmation than cards/international exchanges**

Even if you can use a credit card to buy coffee right then and there, it usually takes 2-3 days for it to clear on your card. Cryptos, however, get cleared within a couple hours at most.

**6. Buyer can't fraud and pull out, but then you rely on your reputation more**

Many of artists had that one or two buyers who, once receiving the artwork, pull the money back on paypal. You don't have this issue with cryptocurrencies because once money is sent and in the seller's hand, it can't be taken back (kind of like cold hard cash). On the other hand, the artist will need to keep his reputation and provide a good service, which he should be doing anyway.

**7. Easier to set up than paypal**

All you do is get a hardware wallet, or download a desktop wallet like Electrum. Bitcoin Core wallet takes a while to load all the blockchains until you can use it, but after that, it's good to go. You don't even need a social security number or a tax ID.

**8. The government doesn't tax your crypto earnings (unless you exchange it for fiat, then it's considered profit)...**

I am not against paying taxes, and it's not the government ""stealing"" from us. It's what keeps our roads fixed and our public facilities functioning. However, you do not have to worry about taxes on your cryptocurrency earning and spending unless you decide to exchange your cryptos for fiat.

**Disadvantages of cryptos over paypal/fiat:**

* speculative and the price goes up and down
* not as many merchants accept crypto payments at the moment, so if you want to use it today, you'll likely have to exchange for fiat

Let me know if you have any questions or recommendations that I should add to this list.",1527957379,02/06/2018 16:36:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8o1rc8/advantages_of_buying_artwork_and_commissions_with/,1

The Bitcoinening,"Based on extensive research on the thoughts in my head I can confidently predict the ‘Bitcoinening’ will occur in the next 3 years.

1. ICOs will crash even harder in 2018 based on regulatory pressure and the realisation most of them are puff.
2. The ICO crash will affect demand and perceived worth of Ether.
3. At the same time trade wars, Euro crashes etc will highlight the need to hedge out of fiat into crypto.
4. Most alt coins will be proven to be junk.
5. XRP is debt driven trash and always will be.
5. There will be flight to the most trusted crypto coin that can store value - Bitcoin

Thus the ‘Bitcoinening’ will come to pass and there will be moon. 

Within 3 years.

New to BTC; inquiry on exchange purchases into personal wallets,"I've been researching for a while, and I'm finally in a financial position to get into BTC. I know, shoulda started sooner, but can't change that now.

-

My question is this; is there any way to buy from an exchange and have it sent directly to a wallet that I am in control of? It seems like there's too many unnecessary steps between purchasing the currency on an exchange, waiting for it to complete, waiting some more, then initiating a transfer to my actual wallet, and paying a fee on top of that. 
-

To elaborate on where I'm coming from:

-
&gt; There seems to be steep fees to buy BTC/alternatives on exchanges (my go to atm is Coinbase since I'm newer to the scene) and then send them to a personal wallet. From what I understand, coinbase actually stores my money in their wallet, and hold it until I decide to move it. I'm not at all comfortable having money on a web-based system like that, so I'm looking for alternatives. 

-
&gt; I set up a SegWit Electrum hot wallet to get the hang of how cryptocurrency moves (I'll be using small amounts once I start purchasing). 

Footnote; I went more into detail here because I'm still very new to cryptocurrency, any other insight unrelated specifically to the question would be appreciated",1527978998,02/06/2018 22:36:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8o46fu/new_to_btc_inquiry_on_exchange_purchases_into/,1

New Guy with a Conspiracy Theory,"Forgive me if this is understood, but do you think Bitcoin Cash branched off with a bigger block size as a short term solution in hopes they could display to the world a faster transaction rate than Bitcoin Core? I'm starting to think they were hoping this short term fix would increase their buyers and decline Bitcoin Core's. Again I'm new to the space, but it seems like SegWit would be the delayed reward route and perhaps better in the grand scheme of things while increasing blocksize is the immediate reward.",1527984332,03/06/2018 00:05:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8o4qlf/new_guy_with_a_conspiracy_theory/,1

Idea For Secure Online Seed Storage.,"I currently store my seeds on paper, in a fire/water proof container, in a hidden location. This is fine as long as it is not stolen or dissolved by time. The scenario that does not work for this setup is if I am away and my hardware wallet is lost, broken, confiscated, etc. and I cannot get back to my paper keys.

Ideally, I want to keep my keys online where I can retrieve them from anywhere with internet access. I know the first rule of Bitcoin is do not expose your keys online... but what if I encrypt my seed (i.e. AES-256) using a SHA-256 hash - of course doing this offline and air-gapped. Then all I need to do is store that ciphertext and the hash ""somewhere"" online in different locations. Then I would be able to recreate my seed phrase from anywhere with an internet connection. The ciphertext and hash could be embedded into any of several blockchains in a variety of different ways, I would only need to remember which blockchain and corresponding block number.

For someone to hack this strategy they would need to know these two pieces of data, that would only exist in a few human brains.

1. Where the ciphertext is stored
2. Where the SHA-256 hash is stored

OK, that's the setup, now bring on the hate. What is wrong with this plan, how is it insecure, how is it worse than the ""paper"" plan? 

Extra points if you just offer criticism with no explanation!

To make it interesting I have encrypted the seed phrase for a wallet with 1.0 BTC using a SHA-256 hash, [here it is](https://blockchain.info/address/3MsLGav4RnFw7U9WDNrfokLU5VByd14TCU). 

And here is the ciphertext, the hash is ""somewhere"" online. If you can decrypt this and get the seed phrase you can collect my Bitcoin.

"The importance of an open, public ledger running on Layer 1","There is much noise and FUD at the moment coming from privacy focused alts such as monero who are framing the public ledger of bitcoin as being of detriment to its long-term utility.

Let's allay those concerns by looking at the bigger picture here...

Should an opaque ledger such as monero become the dominant currency, we would eventually end up with the exact same levels of subterfuge and corruption that bought the current system to its knees (through hidden shell companies and dodgy offshore accounts routed through complex financial instruments) that only a select few of the 'in-group' are privy to.  

In contrast, a transparent, global ledger allows us to hold those who are custodians of public funds to account; enabling glass governance, as well as allowing ethical corporations to expose their supply chains to public scrutiny.  

The more corporations that do this, the more consumers have a choice to 'vote with their pocketbooks' and deal only with companies that they deem align with their own set of moral standards.

For example: if you don't want to be buying an engagement ring that's been involved in the blood diamond trade, you might choose to use a company that has exposed its supply chain on the global ledger to provide you with immutable proof that your purchase has an ethical supply chain.

This does not mean we have to expose our own financial lives to the public.  Don't want your girlfriend to know you've bought her that diamond ring?  Buy it with lightning network and you will be afforded a much greater degree of individual privacy provisioning.  Kinda' like the incognito window in Chrome in that respect.

The key here is ensuring we maintain a public ledger that allows us to insist on full exposure for public officials, institutions and government bodies that should already be expected to be transparent in their actions and accountable to the citizenry funding them.  

This ultimately leads to a world where public representatives taking backhanders from lobbyists and greasing the palms of those in the 'old boys network' becomes a thing of the past due to the increase in crowd-based scrutiny and the ease by which automated algorithms will be able to immediately flag conflicts of interest that might otherwise take decades of research to uncover.  It's currently very easy to cover up a government contract being awarded to your 'mates' with a Swiss bank account or offshore shell company... Try that on a public blockchain however and you're going to be immediately held to account by a crowd of watchers.

Whilst privacy focused coins like monero will still have niche use cases in countries suffering from oppressive regimes (much like VPNs and TOR are essential tools for even the most basic of internet actions in such places), the vast majority of us will champion the more open public nature of bitcoin as a settlement layer, as it means all that increased public scrutiny will eventually lead to a system where we will have a direct influence over where our economic energy is spent, and even see our contributions being put to work in realtime instead of disappearing into a government spending sink hole...

In a monero-esque world, all the cheating we have seen happening is actually *amplified* to extremes since there would be *even less* accountability than there is in the current rigged system. 

Whereas bitcoin leads to a system of radical transparency that finally puts an end to scandals such as the [Cambridge Analytica Brexit debacle](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/14/leave-eu-arron-banks-new-question-referendum-funded-brexit-cambridge-analytica) (where electoral funding rules were broken).  

This could never happen if their accounts had to run through the bitcoin public ledger and were vetted in realtime by the electorate. 

In essence, through transparency we end up with a system where everyone is incentivised to play nicely and, in doing so, we move beyond those old world zero sum games that are no longer fit for purpose in a global world that has realised consensus and collaborative networks are the best way of evolving those archaic hierarchical institutions and the species itself.

Trns ID not showing on blockchain- waited a month!,"Hey Renegade Brains Trust, I could use some help, please.
About a month ago, I tried my first foray into BitCoin.
I watched some youtube videos, got a tutorial from a friend, and spent a while on here just learning what I could.
Feeling pretty confident, I tried a little transaction.  I'm using electrum
It was pretty soon after that I discovered my first transaction was too small to get picked up, and would most likely just be returned as change, so in my youthful exuberance, I did another, much bigger transaction, right away.  To the same address.   The particular address I was using had specified one transaction per address, I later discovered..
So the first amount did come back as change, and was credited back to my wallet.  But the bigger transaction is still showing as unconfirmed.  It hasn't appeared in the address I have sent it to, and the transaction ID doesn't show up on the blockchain. I re-seeded my wallet, and no change.  I've waited a month, and no there's been no change.  

Can anybody enlighten me?

To me this film again shows why the financial system is not to be trusted. You can play with your money there, you can make money there but there is probably always going to be a scam is building up. The interesting thing in this movie is that there is noone who broke the law yet a lot of private people lost huge part of their entire life savings to scammers.

One day man came to his shop , he had a spade on his shoulder and looked exhausted . He took a stone out of his pocket and kept it in front of the shopkeeper and told him that he needs an axe . The shop keeper looked at the stone arrogantly , and then at the man , asking him ,"" what is this ?"" . The customer replied , "" This gold "" . The Shop keeper asks , ""can i eat it ?"" . The customer says , NO

Lost 3BTC to scammers,"So. On Wednesday, I set up an offer in Mycelium app to sell 3 BTC. This guy got back to me, asking for my Telegram ID. After a little chat we decided to meet up in Rotterdam, the meeting point we agreed on was Marriot Hotel.

3 guys showed up, one of them was aged around 25, had a Belgian phone number, claimed to have a business in Belgium etc. Other two were 45+, looked like Romanian to me. They spoke French to each other. We had a little chat, youngster started telling how long he’s been trying to convince his uncles to invest in Bitcoin, to me they sounded like Bitcoin rookies. After a while the uncles offered me to go to the bathroom with them to count the money, my friend stayed outside with the youngster. As we got inside the bathroom, I checked the notes for different security features, everything was good and I handed the stack back to him to put it in the envelope for me. Big mistake.

While walking back outside, one of them told me to stay between them, as to leave an impresson they are afraid of me running away with the money. Fair enough. That injected me with confidence about the whole deal, made me feel I’m holding something precious. As we got back outside, I told my friend everything was ok. We transfered the coins. Then, after a couple of confirmations, the uncles invited my friend to the hotel lobby to discuss “future business opportunities”. Probably done to prevent us from discussing the matter and distract us. I stayed outside to talk to youngster about life in The Netherlands, parties, etc. Then after few minutes we said goodbye.
Got back to the bar across the street, walked in the bathroom to put the money away. Needless to say, the envelope was filled with fakes. Game over.

Guys, please keep your eyes opened. Trust no one. All they need is a fraction of a second to abuse your trust. Double-check everything. Good luck! &lt;3",1528025758,03/06/2018 11:35:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8o7z6u/lost_3btc_to_scammers/,1

Everything you need to know about Fliipit,"Hello everyone,Yesterday I posted on Reddit a post where I presented my new website [Fliipit](https://fliipit.com/). Unfortunately many people thought that it is a scam. I understand that reaction because scammers are everywhere and usually websites claiming that you can earn Bitcoins on them end up stealing Bitcoins fromyou.In this post I will go through the whole process that Fliipit is using. I will explain the idea and you will see that it is not a scam.

  
**What is** [**Fliipit**](https://fliipit.com/)**?**

  
Fliipit is an open platform for everyone. After you register the server with generate a new wallet for you. I'm using Bitcore\-lib \([link](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib)\) to generate the wallet address and private key. The private key is encrypted and saved safely on the server. You check by yourself that the wallet is real by clicking on ""Blockchaine"" in your profile. This wallet is only there in order to facilitate the process of purchasing tickets to join contests. You cannot withdraw Bitcoins from that wallet once you send Bitcoins to it. You must send only the amount needed to purchase tickets.With these tickets you can join the following contests:\-Daily\-Weekly\-Monthly

  
**Please note that you can follow all these transactions on the blockchaine. You can see what transactions were made on your Fliipit wallet. You can also see the full amount raised for the contest and you can see the number of participants and their usernames.**

  
**How can I earn Bitcoins?**

  
When you purchase tickets 95&amp;#37; of the amount will be sent to the address of the wallet associated with the contest and 5&amp;#37; is going to Fliipit.The user can keep the ticket and use it any time he wishes. After joining a contest, users will be in the list op participants of the contest. At the end of the contest, a number of user will be chosen randomly as winners and they will share the full amount between them.Please note that each contest has a minimum number of participants in order to be valid. If a contest is not valid, all participants will receive their tickets back so that they can join in future contests.  
**How can I take my earnings?**  
After reaching a certain level of earning you click on ""claim"" in your profile and send the earning to any address you want. It is better to claim your earnings as soon as you can and send them to a save wallet.

  
**More about the constests...**

|Daily|Weekly|Monthly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Every day 12am \- 10pm|Every week SUN \- FRI \(12pm\)|Every month 1st \- 28th \(7pm\)|
|Max number of participants: 70,000|Max number of participants: 500,000|Max number of participants: 5,000,000|
|70 winners|200 winners|1,000 winners|
|Min number of participants: 210|Min number of participants: 600|Min number of participants: 3000|

  
The contests are scheduled automatically on the server weather people joined or not.

  
**""OK, everything you said is good but how do we know that this is not a scam?""**

  
I will put my email here and if you know any experts in the matter or anyone who is trusted by the community tell them to contact me and I will explain to them everything, all the codes and everything they need to know in order to judge if it is a scam or not.

"Are we ready to drop the ""Bitcoin is a fiat investment"" narrative and get on with the revolution yet?","I may just be talking for myself here, but feel like we Bitcoiners are starting to wake up from this bizarre narrative (THEIR Narrative, and we all know who THEY are) that Bitcoin is some kind of digital asset 'investment' made in fiat to buy and sell (hopefully) in return for fiat profits.

It seems like the shortest time ago, Bitcoin was all about a peaceful silent revolution where, by simply buying what we could afford to lose and encouraging others to do the same and HODLing, we had a chance - maybe the only chance in human history - to remove the power of a select few to create money out of thin air to lord it over all of us and throw endless fake wars with it.

Then suddenly, we started 'getting rich', in fiat terms of course (our meager Bitcoin HODLings staying the same).

We got drunk on the euphoria. 'Real traders' with suits, the talking heads, the IMF, the rothschildes for god's sake - everyone in fact - raving on about the ROI of Bitcoin 'investments'. TA, buy low sell high, price predictions, lambos etc dominated our feeds and our thoughts.

We were duped.

THEY (and again, we know who THEY are) fooled us into viewing Bitcoin not as the revolutionary leaderless, censorship/gov resistant, borderless, permissionless and transparent form of exchange this world has NEVER had, but rather just another thing to buy with substanceless, permissioned fake fiat currency to 'get rich'.

In short, we all, bitcoiners and nocoiners alike, viewed the whole phenomena from the perspective THEY decided for us. 

Not the perspective we were employing at the time - our perspective, our narrative. We allowed, in our own hearts and minds, OUR narrative to be replaced.

Then came the divide and conquer - the apparent 'scaling debate'. It took us by surprise. We hurried to study up on it (some more than others) and consequently chose 'our team' without ever realizing it was THEIR idea, this debate. 

Their 'agreements', their fork, their version of Bitcoin ensued. We got sucked into battling with the gullible few who fell for it and who consequently (and understandably) dug in their heals to defend their erroneous decisions. We got side tracked, again, inTHEIR narrative. It bought them a lot of time and strengthened their successful narrative that made us view this phenomena as a fiat 'investment'.

Guess what, we are still standing, Bitcoin, the money badger don't care, it's still moving forward. When will we ??

Are we ready to drop THEIR narrative, THEIR perspective and get on with the revolution yet???

Our children, grand children etc are still depending on us.",1528043059,03/06/2018 16:24:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8o9nmx/are_we_ready_to_drop_the_bitcoin_is_a_fiat/,1

Thoughts on Government Regulation vs. Self Regulation,"It seems that the U.S. is trying to take the lead on crypto regulations. However, government regulation is in direct conflict with the open, decentralized mission of blockchains. 

At Messari, Ryan Selkis and his team are working on an open source database for self regulation. The promise of self regulation is solving issues of fraud and abuse without having to rely on the heavy hand of government to do so. 

Is government regulation inevitable? Can successful self regulation show governments the benefits of limited government interference?",1528047840,03/06/2018 17:44:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8oa8ee/thoughts_on_government_regulation_vs_self/,1

Bitcoins: Helps this website to grow.,"Hello everyone,Yesterday I posted on Reddit a post where I presented my new website [Fliipit](https://fliipit.com/). Unfortunately many people thought that it is a scam. I understand that reaction because scammers are everywhere and usually websites claiming that you can earn Bitcoins on them end up stealing Bitcoins fromyou.In this post I will go through the whole process that Fliipit is using. I will explain the idea and you will see that it is not a scam.

  
**The source code is available on GitHub. If you are familiar with coding then you will see that the website is programmed to do what I'm presenting here. I hope that this will** **convince you that I'm doing my best to be as transparent as I can.** [**Fliipit Repo**](https://github.com/varissi/fliipit)

  
**What is** [**Fliipit**](https://fliipit.com/)**?**

  
Fliipit is an open platform for everyone. After you register the server with generate a new wallet for you. I'm using Bitcore\-lib \([link](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib)\) to generate the wallet address and private key. You can also access your private key so that you have full control or your Fliipit Wallet. You check by yourself that the wallet is real by clicking on ""Blockchaine"" in your profile. This wallet is only there in order to facilitate the process of purchasing tickets to join contests. You cannot withdraw Bitcoins from that wallet once you send Bitcoins to it. You must send only the amount needed to purchase tickets.With these tickets you can join the following contests:\-Daily\-Weekly\-Monthly

  
**Please note that you can follow all these transactions on the blockchaine. You can see what transactions were made on your Fliipit wallet. You can also see the full amount raised for the contest and you can see the number of participants and their usernames.**

  
**How can I earn Bitcoins?**

  
When you purchase tickets 95&amp;#37; of the amount will be sent to the address of the wallet associated with the contest and 5&amp;#37; is going to Fliipit.The user can keep the ticket and use it any time he wishes. After joining a contest, users will be in the list op participants of the contest. At the end of the contest, a number of user will be chosen randomly as winners and they will share the full amount between them.Please note that each contest has a minimum number of participants in order to be valid. If a contest is not valid, all participants will receive their tickets back so that they can join in future contests.\*\*How can I take my earnings?\*\*After reaching a certain level of earning you click on ""claim"" in your profile and send the earning to any address you want. It is better to claim your earnings as soon as you can and send them to a save wallet.

  
**More about the constests...**

|Daily|Weekly|Monthly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Every day 12am \- 10pm|Every week SUN \- FRI \(12pm\)|Every month 1st \- 28th \(7pm\)|
|Max number of participants: 70,000|Max number of participants: 500,000|Max number of participants: 5,000,000|
|70 winners|200 winners|1,000 winners|
|Min number of participants: 210|Min number of participants: 600|Min number of participants: 3000|

  
The contests are scheduled automatically on the server weather people joined or not.

  
**""OK, everything you said is good but how do we know that this is not a scam?""**

  
I will put my email here and if you know any experts in the matter or anyone who is trusted by the community tell them to contact me and I will explain to them everything, all the codes and everything they need to know in order to judge if it is a scam or not.  
[bitcoinsfliipit@gmail.com](https://www.reddit.com/).  
I hope that will help you understand my website and that you will invite people to join it. Thank you for your time and understanding.

Bitpay making transactions impossible?,"So I have a couple of BTC saved up from mining. I used to occasionally buy computer stuff from a UK merchant with Bitpay.

I tried this today to discover I can't anymore. I followed the usual advice and have my coins on a Ledger Nano S, on a Segwit address.

Bitpay now insist on some weird link thing which only works with a small handful of wallets. I managed to link my Ledger nano S to Electrum, but this is so slow to do anything (hangs for ages at ""not responding"" between each stage) that I actually can't perform a transaction within the 15m window bitpay gives you.

Mycelium on my phone does not support Segwit.

So I guess I'm left unable to spend?

Am I doing something wrong here?!",1528060421,03/06/2018 21:13:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8obr8q/bitpay_making_transactions_impossible/,1

Has anyone paid with lightning without opening a channel directly to the shop?,"Hey guys, 

I was trying to buy a gamecode on www.joltfun.com with lightning but I always get a routing error. I specifically don't want to open a channel to the shop directly because that defeats the purpose of LN - If I open a direct channel I can pay directly with BTC anyway. 

I want to test LN, so I downloaded Eclair Wallet for Android and opened a channel with 0.0013 BTC to the www.rompert.com node because I saw in the lightning node explorer that there is an open channel between the rompert node and the joltfun node. The rompert node is one of the biggest nodes and looks like a good choice. The channel between me and rompert is funded with 0.0013 BTC and the channel between rompert and joltfun is funded with 0.01 BTC, so about ten times more than my channel. The price of the gamecode I want to buy is about 0.001 BTC, so slightly lower than my channel funding. My channel is online. 

When I try to buy the code in the shop it immediately tells me that payment has failed because there was no route/channel to the shop. But I opened the channel to rompert node which has a channel to joltfun.

Why does it not work? It's basically the simplest use of the LN network but if that does not even work, I am not very confident in the tech I must say....",1528097631,04/06/2018 07:33:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ofgrk/has_anyone_paid_with_lightning_without_opening_a/,1

If you hold crypto at the time that either one of these things happens and you will have so much money you won't know what to do with it.,"Just like Andreas says instead of having bullshit endless bitcoin &amp; bitcoin cash scaling debates and whatever other crappy arguments people are having we should be  focusing on the real enemy which is the reserve bank which controls  monetary policy like a school teacher telling the kids when it's time to  play and when it's time out to stand in the naughty corner. Truth is  money's value has been going down the toilet ever since the gold  standard was abandoned in the 70's.  Check the charts, ever since the  gold standard was removed, inflation has been going up like the bitcoin  price in December.  The 'federal reserve' is an oxymoron, it's a private  company that holds no gold reserves.  Bitcoin's monetary policy is all  we need.

The government is the next enemy  that we need to focus on.  Bitcoin should be legal tender but it's not.   This bullshit capital gains tax that we pay even if we buy a cup of  coffee is just crap.  Bitcoin is money.  It's much more money than that  fake bullshit pieces of paper the reserve prints every day.  It's money  because it's supply is limited and this can't be changed at all.

Instead of bullshit scaling debate posts I want to see the community focus on 2 things.

1. how we are going to get rid of the reserve bank.
2. how we are going to make bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, eos whatever legal tender.

Achieve  either of these 2 things and if you hold crypto at the time that this  happens you will be so rich you won't know what to do with your money.

Thank you.

Time for an exit strategy?,"I've been in crypto for almost a year. At the begining i invested in a few altcoins, had some good and bad days, later exchanged all altcoins for bitcoin. Overall i'm down 40% on my investment and i don't feel comfortable loosing a cent more.   
I was thinking maybe to exit holding/trading btc all together, buy a few antminers, amd and nvidia gpus which are at MSRP price right now (i have ways of getting them ~15% below MSRP) , wait for a mining craze and make a 60-80% profit . Worst case scenario i'll loose 10-15% if mining craze won't happen within a year. If it won't, I'll be forced to sell it all because of risk of equipment getting outdated.  
Just trying to cut the losses because i invested more than i can loose.

Refunding of LN channels?,"Trying to learn more about the details of the Lightning Network.

Are LN nodes just tied to a single address?

So say you do an on-chain transaction to four other addresses with LN nodes to open up four channels and create your LN node. You eventually spend all the money you have in the channel (and you aren't receiving any money). You want to refund your channel. Is a LN node basically just a LN attachment to a Bitcoin address? So can you just send do another channel opening on-chain transaction from that address, let's say to just one other address this time, and so that bitcoin gets put into your already existing node but now you have five channels open from it instead of four?",1528107749,04/06/2018 10:22:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8og70a/refunding_of_ln_channels/,1

Second Echelon of Attack by the Establishment,"The first wave of establishment’s counter\-attack on Bitcoin and crypto was like “hey, you’ll be better off trusting us, as usual”. Tactics were evolving from “crypto is criminal, beware!” to “look, we also got blockchain!”. Apparently, the strategy has failed. Since recently, one can sense quite different types of raids. 

Once it became clear that the monopoly on trust is not recoverable, it is now advantageous for the establishment to destroy trust altogether. It is an illusion they can’t go without trust, in the situation where nobody trusts anybody. As a matter of fact, it is very profitable but only for a very narrow strata at the top. The complete status quo is not possible to save but partial one can be preserved, at the cost of radically increased inequality. The classic [pirate game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game) describes this well. 

Crypto today is NOT the solution to trust and the sober part fo the community doesn't claim so, crypto is THE PATH TO EXPERIMENT and develop the solution. Before everyone “has crypto” in some form, no new business or social model can work. Uber became possible AFTER we all got GPS sensors in our pockets; Amazon become possible AFTER we all got our homes connected; etc. So why we keep hearing complaints about ""no killer app, ten years in""?  

The formal extensions to the pirate game are very interesting but you will have even more fun by reading them together with the [rich people being more unethical study](https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-02-28/rich-people-more-unethical-likely-cheat-and-steal-study-finds) \(and, yes, testosterone levels [aggravate](https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/chair-of-sociology-dam/documents/sis2016/slides/SIS2016_Slides_Raub.pdf) that!\). Trust is broadly, hugely misinterpreted by incumbents! For example, aversion to the economic risk \(losing money or opportunity\) has been proven to be [lower](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wing/publications/Gligor-Wing11.pdf) than aversion to being betrayed. A behaviour perceived as wrong evokes a sense of betrayal and a desire to punish violators, even if punishment comes at a cost. As a result, we see wrong takes on trust everywhere. Centralised monopolies like Airbnb, for example, deploy the reciprocal feedback method which actually [spoils](http://cramton.umd.edu/market-design/bolton-greiner-ockenfels-engineering-trust.pdf) reputation information and trade efficiency.  

As the society is formed by the middle class, business sphere is formed by mid\-sized companies. By now, a typical owner is so irritated by the pointless hype that he is ready to pay Deloitte of someone like that just to be sure he can ignore crypto and live on, normally. All major consulting firms offer the blockchain service already. Of course, they apply a huge bias. Importantly, both IBM and Microsoft—the only two companies [featured](https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14018/the-10-largest-consulting-firms-in-the-world) in the world’s top 10 consultancies who could be considered as being from a purely technological background—offer some particular ready\-to\-use tools. You will see about fifty [use cases](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/use-cases/) they advertise. However, after an attentive look an apparent diversity is collapsing just into the couple of big topics—supply chain optimisation and streamlining complicated sales processes—both being mostly about trust enhancement. Why so narrow? Crypto has a lot more to offer. For example, better automation of compatibility. Why do they focus on something that either can’t be achieved at the current level of adoption or is an abuse of the idea altogether?

One more suspicious thing is the apparent connivance towards exchanges. Try to imagine they are all shut down tomorrow morning. Do you think it is going to be strategically good or bad for the core crypto development? All fraud is gone, in one second. All of it! The funding is limited but it only goes to devoted, true teams. Bitcoin image is not mixed with shit every day any longer. Just think about it.

BitRocket ATM in Sydney (234 George St) took money with no sight of bitcoin.,"Hey guys, 
This is a warning to anyone living in Sydney, the other day I went to this bitcoin ATM by bitrocket (which I have used many times in the past with no issue). This time however after sending a large amount of money via their ATM it simply ate up the 400 dollars I put in. The machine didn't give any errors and on the UI the transaction seemed to have gone through perfectly fine. However it's been 2 days now with no sight of even an unconfirmed transaction in my wallet (Mycelium). I have tried to contact their support but have found no success whatsoever. Just a warning to all Australian bitcoin users thinking about using this company's machine.

Evaluate the accuracy of this theory for me.,"Money is merely a measuring tool. A tool for measuring the amount of value in a particular place. Money can start off being an asset before it gains a monetary role, but when it gains a monetary role the mere fact it becomes a unit of account turns it into a tool for measuring value.

Value is broadly defined as GDP. So money is therefore a tool for measuring GDP, which can also facilitate the transfer of that value we define as GDP.

Global GDP is currently around $100 trillion.

So it would make sense to say that if society adopted a form of global money, that form of money would have to represent at a minimum the value of global GDP to function as money.

Why is this theory right or wrong?",1528126605,04/06/2018 15:36:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8oi7x3/evaluate_the_accuracy_of_this_theory_for_me/,1
A pruned node needs to store all UTXOs. How it comes you can specify the storage size?,"I understand that in a pruned node, once your node has downloaded the block data and validated the blocks/transactions in it, it throws away the old data that it no longer needs (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ywru2/what_is_the_prune_mode_exactly)

However they keep the complete database of all UTXOs, which is needed to verify new blocks.

So, how it comes you can specify the size of the storage using the -prune=&lt;n&gt; option? It should need whatever the UTXOs need. 

If you specify less than UTXOs size, then you should not be able to verify new blocks. If you specify more, what does it mean, some of the old block are stored even when not needed?

Theory On Price Manipulation,"OK, this might be a little winded but hear me out and let me know your thoughts. Over and over I keep hearing from my Google feed that Bitcoin couldn't rally to 8k etc due to the low trading volume. Here's my thoughts:  trading volume in terms of bitcoin doesn't have to be high for bitcoin's price to rally!  I strongly believe that the price is being artificially restrained. Think about it. I mean supply and demand determines value right? Value is currently expressed in USD as its currently the unit of account which, hopefully will one day be transformed to BTC. Considering bitcoins direct competition is how value in the world is currently expressing value , and the fact that the controlling elite of the world now use OTC markets to buy huge quantities of bitcoin without driving up what they consider the plebs rate (coinbase, gdax, Binance etc), as long as people are willing to sell their BTC OTC there will be IMO, pressure on the price. This is because, IMO, not only do they have vested interest in keeping BTC restrained (as they're the competition) , but also because they can make a fortune on the SEC regulated futures by betting against the pleb rate. Fortunately I can only see this going on for so long because at the end of the day there are more people who are scooping up these coins on the pleb markets. I believe that this is the real reason for the ""low volume"". They don't have the means to keep buying and selling bitcoin at artificially depressed prices back and forth to the bots on the pleb exchanges and us plebs are buying them up!  Remember its not about how much bitcoin is traded, it's about how much fiat currency is used to buy whatever BTC is traded even a single Satoshi5 that being said, enjoy your time in the sun fiat because the plebs are coming!",1528127605,04/06/2018 15:53:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8oicr1/theory_on_price_manipulation/,1

Cold Storage Idea,"https://i.redd.it/hf270gko90211.jpg

Preface: This is a TEST wallet! There are no bitcoins stored here, no will there ever be! \(or if there are, they weren't mine!\)

TLDR: Scrambled the order of the 24 words using a password, stamped onto 22 GA weldable steel plate. What could go wrong? I feel like I'm overlooking something fairly simple that makes this insecure.

So, I recently got a Ledger Nano S, and have had plenty of time to explore it, generate several wallets \(including adding a 25th word for extra security\), add them as watch\-only addresses into Electrum, or use the Nano S with Electrum to send/receive funds. I feel pretty confident I know what I'm doing, but wanted your opinions on how I should handle long\-term key storage. The idea thats been floating around my head for a while has been to stamp it out in metal \(I know a few companies offer ""build\-it\-yourself"" setups, but I wanted something a bit cheaper\). This is the result of my experiment.

""But wait!"" I hear you say, ""you've just posted your private keys onto the internet! Oh noes! You fool!"" Except that I'm sure this sequence of words will be plugged into a handful of wallets to see whats up, only to find out that it doesn't work. Thats because the order of the words is encoded \(and no, the upside down A in WASTE is not a clue \- that was completely unintentional\).

The idea I have is that even listing out all 24 words, assuming they're in some unknown order, that creates a 24! number of possible combinations, which is 6.2e23 possible combinations. For perspective, there are 1.5e48 possible public keys, 7.9e28 private keys, and 9.2e18 grains of sand on the Earth. Needless to say, the random order seems secure enough, provided one can unrandomize the order. To do this, I've selected a fairly simple shift cipher, using a word hopefully only known to the end user \- which is the weakest part of the system. However, since this is meant as a fairly secure long\-term storage mechanism for people completely computer illiterate, I can't really do much better/complex. My hope is that if someone else finds this, they'll try forwards, backwards, every other, every 3rd, diagonal, etc, but never figure out the exact combo. After trying to bruteforce it for a couple days, they'll give up and toss it in the trash.

The cipher works by first writing down the code on a piece of paper \(offline to make sure its safer\). You then count out the alphabet until you get to the first word of the unscrambled wallet. In this case, my encoding word is TEST \(any word is acceptable provided its fairly long \- longer the better \- up to 23 characters\). What you do is starting with where you wrote AMATEUR, you count A, then LATER becomes B. You repeat this until you get to the letter T in TEST, which happens to be ARCTIC. This becomes the first word of the unscrambled wallet, and you cross it off \(skipping over it for the remainder of the code\). After you find ARCTIC, you start counting again with REPORT being A, RADAR being B, and so on, looping around until you get to the 2nd letter in the password E. This means the 2nd word of the unscrambled wallet is AMATEUR. You repeat this, looping through the list of words and password as many times as necessary. \(There's got to be a word for this type of cipher, but I don't have a clue what it's called.\)

All of this is stamped onto 22 GA weldable sheet metal, to be stored in a safe or somewhere dry. The idea was to create a fairly survivable long\-term storage option where one of my family members could forget about this completely, find it 10 years down the road and have it still be in perfectly readable condition. Since I'm using the BIP39 implemented in the Ledger, finding a word list should be fairly straight forward in the event the metal gets bent/ripped across a word or two. The idea would be that once the user wishes to redeem their coins, this wallet would be completely abandoned for something else secure, so its a 1\-time use setup.

Since I know nothing of metalworking, and I'm not the greatest at crypto, I felt like sharing the idea to inspire others, or to get advice on what I may be missing. It seems fairly straightforward, but I feel like there could be some fatal flaw that I'm completely overlooking with this. My biggest concern would be that the individual has to memorize some scramble password \(which they'll have to share with me, but thats the nature of the beast and not relevant at this time\), which means it could be bruteforced out, or simply forgotten. But I'd prefer a simply forgotten password than to create this ""ultra secure wallet"" that the first person who accidentally gets hold of it can steal everything from.",1528129100,04/06/2018 16:18:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8oikd5/cold_storage_idea/,1

Question about accepting BTC as an online vendor,"I am in the very beginning stages of starting a company where I will sell media online for download.  I would like to be set up to accept BTC \(and probably a couple of other cryptocurrencies while I am at it\) as forms of payment.  I am sure this is out there, but I thought I would ask if anyone knew exactly where to look while I am at it.

The issue I foresee, is verifying that someone has paid me before the website gives them the download link.  Most online business portals are set up to do this pretty easily with fiat, obviously.  But I am wondering how I would go about making the website be able to verify that my BTC wallet has received a payment, and then how is it able to track that payment down to that specific person having sent it before it opens up download links for them.  

Does anyone out there have a website that accepts cryptocurrency payments?  How have you made this work for you?

Are there any functional BTC plugins for WooCommerce that don't use 3rd party vendors?,"I expected this to be more popular in the community, but the only free plugin I found was [this one by gesman](https://github.com/gesman/bitcoin-payments-for-woocommerce) which hasn't seen an update in years and is broken in some vital ways.

[CryptoWoo](https://www.cryptowoo.com/) looks like the next best option, but both the plugin and the add-on to allow use of a HD wallet are proprietary.

The remaining plugins have you use the merchant's API which will typically add fees around ~1%, which doesn't sound like much, but seems unreasonable to me given that all you're doing is using a public key and scanning the blockchain for payment confirmation.

I'm in the process of fixing the older plugins for BTC and BCH, but I'm a bit surprised that there seems to be so little community activity around this. I thought with WooCommerce being very popular and merchant accouns being mostly annoying, crypto payments would be a pretty welcome alternative, especially given that wallets are pretty easy to set up and maintain.",1528137442,04/06/2018 18:37:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ojpco/are_there_any_functional_btc_plugins_for/,1

"PSA: Americans, Bitcoin, Income taxation","THERE HAS BEEN A FLURRY OF WORRY and fuss over recent IRS efforts to secure information on bitcoin transactors. The anxiety is misplaced.

Let me say first that there is nothing inherently taxable about using or receiving bitcoin. It's just a medium of exchange like any other. There is no tax on exchanges per se, nor on profits, gains or receipts, per se.

By the same token, however, there is a tax-- measurable by the value of bitcoin received-- for doing taxable things resulting in those receipts. That is, not all things done for which bitcoin might be received are taxable, but the receipt of bitcoin is relevant to the tax when received for doing taxable things.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS that concern about IRS prying into records of bitcoin transactions is misdirected. The concern should be at the prying itself, without regard to the bitcoin element.

Unless it has been previously established that a taxable activity has been conducted, the IRS has no valid interest in any transaction. Thus, a blanket demand for information on all transactions is an offensive, possibly 4th amendment-violating intrusion.

AT THE SAME TIME, anyone and everyone engaging in bitcoin transactions and troubled by these bureaucratic intrusions MUST BECOME CtC-EDUCATED. That and that alone will protect from all the practical ill-effects of such intrusions (which routinely happen in other venues, such as conventional banking, anyway).

Only those ignorant of the hidden truths about the income tax have reason to fear information falling into the hands of the IRS. So, keep on keeping crypto. Just get educated about the tax, too.

Does Coinbase Have Enough Dollars to Support a 50k BTC Price?,The problem with a service like Coinbase is that if the price of BTC were to get high enough it could outstrip the amount of liquidity that the site had to be able to cash people out.  They would be forced to borrow money from banks to be able cash people out that were selling.  The reason this is true is that they do not control all of the dollars that exist for the market to balance out.  If the price across all exchanges were to get really high the site itself is where the liquidity comes from to support that price.  I think that is why you see them not report much user data because they are trying to suppress the price of BTC.,1528145572,04/06/2018 20:52:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8okttg/does_coinbase_have_enough_dollars_to_support_a/,1

Satoshi Nakamoto Impersonator/Fraud,"Hello fellow Bitcoiners, I would just like to let you know that I found another Satoshi impersonator on Telegram, his name is @TheSatoshiNakamoto, his phone number is +19176177896, and his Bio says ""Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Real Creator : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi"".
All of this is obviously fake but he has been reported many times to have asked for money people in Telegram groups, using his fake identity as a means of gathering personal wealth. I advise all of you to stray away from this fraudster. Upvote for visibility.

Shango: Mobile Lightning Wallet + Docker LND Image,"OK, I at first was put off by their slick marketing video, but I read over the Github site, and realized that these Shango guys may have solved a real problem.

By embedding the docker image for a lightning node *in your phone*, and launching it as needed on AWS, the problem of ""always on"" is essentially solved.... maybe solved better than using a watchdog protocol.

Tightly coupling the ""running of a lightning node"" with a mobile product, and using a compressed docker container to do so seems to work ""well enough"" for most applications.

Plus, the README at the shango github is engaging and probably more fun than most Reddit posts on this sub.  While I'm certainly not vetting the implementation, the *idea* behind it makes a lot of sense.

Check it out:

Anyway to trace if I have access to a particular BTC address?,"So I use an onion site that the last week of May, I got a notice that popped up when I logged in that said ""Note: Your bitcoin receiving address has been changed. The current address is \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. \(This notification disappears in 2d 19h 40m 21s \).""  So I went and changed my bitcoin receiving address to match the one that displayed, from what I currently had. Now I don't know what the hell happened but all my escrow for the last 2 weeks have all gone to this address until I changed it back. I can't think of where I would have gotten this address to input other than on the screen in front of me prompting me to change it.   I feel like I somehow have access to this BTC address but I can't figure out how.

I sent  0.04623373 to  1Pe3CmTNJf2gEUoKpXkVNS5HxUFyVxptML  and all my escrow from a site I vend on has been going to to that address. Is there anyway I can trace and find out if I have access to that BTC address? I have wallets on Electrum, Exodus, [coinb.in](https://coinb.in). Anyway, here is a screencap from bitcointracker showing the disbursement from 1Pe3CmTNJf2gEUoKpXkVNS5HxUFyVxptML to 1Pe3CmTNJf2gEUoKpXkVNS5HxUFyVxptML \(one I have no idea is associated with\):

Future in Focus: ADAMANT Messenger,"With the rapidly developing technologies in the modern world the risk of jeopardizing one’s privacy is growing. When it comes to messaging applications, the users are mostly required to verify their identity, providing huge amounts of personal data, including phone numbers, addresses, photos, which makes them vulnerable to the attacks which are aimed at stealing private information.
This data is stored on servers that can be hacked despite all security measures. And users do not know how their personal data will be used by criminals after being stolen.

Even if your data is not stolen, a lot of messengers can be used for creating a clone of your account, copying photos, naming other things with your name and sending out fraudulent messages that would damage your or your friends' image.

The problem of anonymity can be solved with the help of blockchain technology. There is no doubt in the availability of cryptocurrency for transferring information about transactions. Moreover, blockchain can be used for sending messages as well.

One of the blockchain projects which stand out of the crowd is ADAMANT. The ADAMANT project is made to respond to the question of trust in private data transfer security, since it is based on a proven to be robust Blockchain conception, and its program code is open and public.

As the developers of the project state, ADAMANT has such distinctive security and anonymity features as:

•	All messages are directly stored in the blockchain
•	The is no access to the user’s address book
•	The is no access to the user’s location information
•	No user identifications - a complete anonymity of use
•	All messages are fully encrypted on the sender’s device and then decrypted on the recipient side
•	The client app does never transfer a user’s Private Key or mnemonic phrase over the network
•	No user Private Data is being transferred
•	The message history is never stored on a device and is directly loaded from the blockchain
•	It is impossible to obtain the user’s IP-address
•	The program code for ADAMANT Messenger and blockchain are openly sourced
•	ADAMANT accounts can not be closed, blocked or limited by anyone, including the developers",1528152205,04/06/2018 22:43:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8olorj/future_in_focus_adamant_messenger/,1

Becomes harder and harder to hold on...,"   
I had been trading and doing bunch of other things in crypto as a hobby. But When BTC hit 15\-20k I decided that I should become a company, pay my taxes and provide for my family in crypto. It worked out well for couple months. But right after I became a company, BTC went down pretty bad and it\`s been gradually going down since then. So I can\`t really provide a life through crypto anymore. The last 3 months, I made less than half of what I made in November, December, an January. Don\`t get me wrong. I strongly believe in Crypto and am an early adopter. I love the volatility, the community, the cause and the technology. But I have to pay my bills and I don\`t wanna look for a job again. So here\`s what I\~ve been doing so far...  


1\- Currently I have 2 different bots running which neighter of them really makes money at all. Because they\`re still at the trial stages and I\`m not sure if it\`ll ever work out or not. So I can\`t put so much money in them.  


2\- I tried arbitrage for a while but there\`s not much of that anymore. Even if you can find an opportunity, you either have to risk tons of money \(in 6 digits\) or you have to wait in a low volume market to see if anyone buys your high sell order. So the arbitrage doesnt really do anything anymore either for little people like me.  


3\- I\`m still manually trading between 3\-4 main currencies but as you know no coin is going high against dollar nor BTC. So I just buy and wait... then it goes down even more. I just don\`t know how long is this downtrend going to stay? If it goes for another month, I will have to look for other options, other than crypto to provide for my family and pay my bills.  


4\- I made pretty good money on the airdrops during Nov\-Dec\-Jan but now that market is suffering too. Based on a pretty recent study, 85&amp;#37; of the ICOs are scam. 12&amp;#37; of them barely have actual coins and only 2 something percent of them actually goes into an exchange and become dumpable. As we all know almost all new coins suffer on the value. So there\`s almost no opportunity in airdrops and forks anymore either.  


5\- I have a Facebook group with 50k members which brings in a small income from ads. But that amount wont even pay one bill.  


So I\`ll greatly appreciate if anyone gives any advises on what other ways out there in crypto world to money off of?  
Now, I should mention that I have morals and ethics. I won\`t scam people, create ICOs, do any kind of fraud, participate in any kind of ""adult"" project.

funding for community projects,"Hello everyone! Thank you for opening this page! Let me briefly introduce myself. I am Daniel, a young, german crypto enthusiast with a background as event manager, marketing consultant and HR responsive. I left Germany 2 years ago and moved to Vietnam, where I started day-trading and mining for a living.

For over a year now I’ve been facing various problems in A : the Vietnamese economy and B : the Asian Crypto Market.

I am currently working on both problems and with your help, I would be able to do a huge step!

I want to introduce 2 projects I am building right now:

A : Task! A D-Application for both employers and those who are seeking work. No matter if you are student, retired, housemen/- wife, pregnant or unemployed for other reasons, Task is a place where you can always find work matching with your schedule! Task is also for employers who for example, can’t find people for delivery jobs or people which need to get simple tasks done like grocery shopping, car wash, walking your dog, picking your kids up and so on. A mini job central for those who are seeking financial support or reliable human resources.

And the big plus: all payments are made in our own T-Coin (TCN) . You will be able to buy and sell TCN at anytime for BTC or Fiat or transfer your coins to your Wallet.

I already put 7.500$ of my own money as base capital into Task, forged a 5 man team with young talented geniuses, which are working on Task already. For the finalization we are in need of another 5.000$ right now for Payment Module and Marketing. We want to have Task done by January and would appreciate any donation helping us getting close towards getting closer to our goal!

B : A community P2P Crypto Trading Platform with 0% exchange fees. The SEA crypto market, especially Vietnam is dominated by Remitano. A so called P2P exchange, which is making more trouble and harm then helping people to connect. There were hundreds of accusations , calling out scam and bad service. Also the customer services is a big joke. They lie and are not helpful what so ever. The monopol position allows them to do so, thats why I am creating a P2P market place, that doesn’t take fees for exchanging coins at all. You offer what you are willed to sell, if there is a match, we are the middle man. A non profit community based service, with proper customer support and a decent team behind. I also put 6.500$ into this project already, we have a prototype ready and 3 people working on the website. Another 5.000$ is needed for this project for marketing, transaction modules and final improvements.

There will be an ICO upcoming and every donater will get an exclusiv amount of coins worth his donation upfront!

If you want to help me building this projects, please donate here in BTC. Please PM me and leave your wallet adress as well, so I know for which project you donated and to receive the TCN coins pre ICO in future !

Many thanks, Daniel!

The risks of a pro-crypto political party,"John McAfee said he's running a pro\-crypto presidential campaign. That's great and all, but wouldn't this do more harm than good? Here is my list of pros and cons:

Pros: more people would become knowledgeable about crypto, myths about crypto gain less traction, and technological investments become talked about more

Cons: crypto gets caught up in the political cycle and gets its name dragged through the mud. I know that markets in general can be pretty volatile based off perception \(#Kyliejenner #snapchat\), but would it serve the interest of this community to have even more volatility in this new gem of blockchain?

Personally, I think the cons outweigh the pros. McAfee is great for supporting crypto, but he should let a younger and more grassroots campaign lead the way.

"The foundation of an idea to figure out how to value bitcoin. ""What is bitcoins fair market value"".","Bitcoin is not an asset, it is money. It is a container to store the value we as humans create. Its main value proposition is its ""store of value"" properties. Afterall, no one would buy bitcoin if the total supply could be diluted at will. 

You can not begin to understand how to value bitcoin until you understand it is not an asset, it is money.

What value do we as humans store in monetary mediums? We store the value we create. The value we create is defined as GDP (Gross Domestic Product). When I create value by providing my time I store that created value in money (my salary). When someone turns cheap steel and plastic into a valuable car, that cars value is stored in money, hence its ""price"".

You can understand bitcoins value (price) by understanding its value comes from people storing value inside it. 

Global GDP (Gross World Product / GWP) is over $100 Trillion in terms of USD. GWP per capita is roughly $16,000.

We have roghly 25 million bitcoin users. $16,000 multiplied by 25 million users equals $400 Billion dollars. So this is a good average to determine bitcoins value.

Coincidently the total cryptocurrency market cap is $350 Billion. Not far off.

So in conclusion: bitcoins fair market value is the number of users multiplied by average GDP per capita. 

Or in reverse: the number of bitcoin users is bitcoins market cap divided by average GDP per capita.

We know this to be true because if bitcoin gains a role as a single global currency its ability to function as a form of money would mean its value would HAVE to incorporate or absorb the value of global GWP.

This theory may be baloney or it may be the foundation of an idea that can help us as a community build a model we can reliably use to determine bitcoins fair market value. 

There are many people out there trying to find a model to value bitcoin and I hope this helps.

Feel free to take this idea and build on it.",1528181208,05/06/2018 06:46:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8oop1m/the_foundation_of_an_idea_to_figure_out_how_to/,1

Misconception everyone seems to have on this subreddit,"1. Not everyone has heard of bitcoin.
Nearly everyone has heard of bitcoin. They just don't use it yet, but here is the interesting thing. If you were to offer payments in Bitcoin to anyone they would accept it. It depends in the country, but if they are lower than middle class they still need local currencies to buy food and month to month basics for their families so sometimes for these people having a reliable and legal bitcoin exchange are not possible in their countries so they can't accept all of their income that way. It still doesn't stop many of them from accepting parts of payments in BTC.
2. No one uses bitcoin for services/goods
I have hired app developers, designers, comic artists, anime artists, animator, hollywood fx producer, online gamers, portrait artists, advertisers, hardware designers, tax consulting, broker and legal consulting with bitcoin. Nearly everyone has heard of bitcoin they just don't know how to use it. You offer and i am 100% sure they will think about it as a viable option, but downside u probably have to teach them how to use it and if you hire many people this could be very tiring.

Tldr: Everyone knows bitcoin is hipster and cool. They will accept it as payment they just don't know how to start. To grow bitcoin more companies need to start paying people with bitcoin maybe as bonus,or as a small portion of their salary.

Why Bitcoin is going to play a big role in our lives?

You may say “How can I spend bitcoins?”. Don’t worry, bitcoin can already be accepted in numerous shops, websites and companies all over the world.
Buy what you need for BTC.

The number of companies accepting bitcoin payments has increased over the last few years. For example, Microsoft and travel website Expedia both accept bitcoin as a means of payment. 

Cryptocurrency has also found favor in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. One interesting fact, Icelandic singer Bjork is also accepting bitcoin payments for her latest album. 

You see, crypto has made huge steps all over the world. Jack Lawson from New York bought a modern bed for his new flat on Overstock with Bitcoins. Another crypto holder, Tracey Blomfield from the UK, chose the Xbox 360 on Newegg and payed BTC for it. Sounds fascinating, doesn’t it?

Hand in hand with Bitcoin in everyday life.

So, you can see that consumers may pay with their BTC on many popular websites. Besides that, Bitcoins can be accepted when paying for an education. Paul Birch pays BTC for his education at the University of Cyprus each year and Donna Atwood also uses BTC for similar payments at King’s College in North Carolina.

One more amazing fact, in parts of Asia, Bitcoin is already being accepted as payment for utilities. Wanzi Lee from China pays for her gas, water, and electric bills using Bitcoins, without having to convert into yuan. Japan is also keeping up with the times. Their consumers can buy electronics with BTC at the largest electronics stores in the country. This is the way Akira Tanaka from Tokyo bought her second TV in a big local electronics store.

We built a crypto index that lets you discover new cryptocurrencies through extensive filter and sort options. It also has a playful design and advanced features! Feedback?,"Hi!

There are a ton of great websites that provide a number of analytical data and info on cryptocurrencies. These are great, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed and confused while getting started in the space.

This is why my cousin and I launched [https://coin\-deck.com](https://coin-deck.com/) It's a mobile friendly, easy to navigate crypto index with a playing cards format. It focuses on discovering and tracking cryptocurrencies through the use of filters and sort options.

Currently, the websites lets you search cryptocurrencies based on market cap, price, age, industry, ratings and types. You can then filter the results through various options such as 24h gains, 24 volume or ATH traceback.

You can also add coins to your watchlist and add the ones you hold to your portfolio ""deck"" to track your earnings.

More features and filters will be added as we go along.

We'd love to hear your feedback!

Simple Beginners Instructions for buying Bitcoin in Australia,"So, you've decided you want to use a cryptocurrency. Good thinking!  


Firstly, financially: Never invest what you can't afford to lose \(treat it like a secondary savings account, or revolution contributions\). Although a small amount might not give you a return in the very short term, it may potentially return a lot in the long term \- financially, and politically.

1. Download a free software wallet \(Exodus\), which is a program for your computer.
2. Buy a hardware wallet \(Ledger Nano S\), which is where you store your Bitcoin.
3. Go to Bitcoin.com.au and enter how much you want to buy in $AUD, enter your Exodus wallet address,  select a bank, and enter your phone number on which you will receive a short\-lived account number.
4. Make your cash deposit at the bank you've selected with the receipt on your phone.
5. Plug the Ledger in, and move the Bitcoin to Ledger from Exodus.
6. Keep Ledger in a safe place. Write down all addresses on multiple pieces of paper. If you lose the Ledger and the paper you lose your Bitcoin. You are now your own bank.

Ask me if you'd like me to elaborate on 4 and 5, or if you want me to simplify any instructions.

Good luck!",1528194842,05/06/2018 10:34:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8opqxl/simple_beginners_instructions_for_buying_bitcoin/,1

Website to share which stores / shops accept cryptocurrencies as a payment,"Hi all, I have been building a website for this past month to help us share locations of stores / shops that accept cryptocurrencies as payment. I don't know if someone else has made this, but I do hope this website would be useful not just for us, but to encourage more people joining crypto community.

In this website, you can search for any city where you live in / visiting and add some stores that you know are accepting cryptocurrency as a payment method. Right now, I haven't applied any verification measurement, so I hope and believe all users here will be a responsible one.

Features included are still very basic. You will need to register with an email address if you want to post a store \(still no email verification, yes please don't spam\) If you guys are happy with this project, I am planning to add more features in immediate future. 

Please support it by helping to spread the words, filling in the records, and give feedback to me. I hope with this movement, many more stores will be encouraged to accept cryptocurrencies while helping us to use our cryptocurrencies as well.

Shillerz- The crypto-place to be! (get rewarded for your calls),"Hey guys!

I want to share my first project in the crypto world!

Story / Idea:

As a member of the crypto community, I have always wanted a simple place bringing together the world best crypto traders. And when I say trader, I'm not talking about the “gurus” who erase all the traces of their failed calls. What I want to build in an healthy competition between the best crypto analysts, help them to build their community and reward the best.

From this idea, we decided to create Shillerz, a free social network for all crypto\-enthusiasts.

The concept:

Shillerz is a free social network where you can create a call and share it with your community. As a user, you can make a public call \(accessible to all\) or a paid call \(See the picture below\) and get paid in Shillcoin ! Shillerz is directly connected to Binance apis in order to calculate the calls’ reliability. Shillerz brings you security thanks to its advanced Rating System; no one can cheat. Once the call is launched it is not possible to delete it. Our cut of the edge algorithm will rank the top Shillerz according to their last predictions. Being in the top 10, will show your dominance and will help you to monetize your future calls..

[https://www.shillerz.com/shillerz\_explain.png](https://www.shillerz.com/shillerz_explain.png)

Shillcoins :

Shillcoin is our e\-currency platform. 1 Shillcoin will always equals 1 EUR, you can turn your Shillcoin into EUR and cash it out via Paypal. So, if you are a great analyst you should be able to make some $$$!

Recommended strategy \(if you don’t have any followers yet\): Shillerz gives you the opportunity to make yourself known. Start by making public call to grow your community and finally become a crypto\-influencer, \(it will work only if you are good Smiley \)

“I just want to follow calls” Shillerz allows you to follow free calls from the world best crypto\-trader. You will not miss any train anymore, next : M00N !

Shillerz is now live : [https://www.shillerz.com](https://www.shillerz.com/)",1528209099,05/06/2018 14:31:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8or9n3/shillerz_the_cryptoplace_to_be_get_rewarded_for/,1

So I met this idiot who really believes he met Satoshi Nakamoto.,"An idiot man I know in Colorado claims to have spoken to Satoshi Nakamoto. He said he first met satoshi back in 2006 while playing Counterstrike 1.7. He said he revealed the idea of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology to him during that time and would talk to him almost everyday. He didn’t reveal his full name but he said his name is Scott, a Swedish man who attended Texas Tech University. He claims Scott had a wallet of 9.7 million bitcoins and proved it to him by showing him his funds back in 2009 or 2010. He also claims that they’re more than 21 million bitcoin to be mined. They’re actually 24 million to be mined because the creator premined 3 million for himself and will never be in circulation. Now this man isn’t joking, he swore on his children that this happened. I personally don’t believe any of this bullshit but this guy truly believes he’s Satoshi and swears on his Daughters head.

"Bitcoin answers the Byzantine General’s problem, but could it also answer the [Drake Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation) too?","**Bitcoin answers the Byzantine General’s problem, but could it also answer the [Drake Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation) too?**


If we use the Drake Equation to estimate the number of intelligent and technically advanced civilizations on other planets, we are left with a question as to why we have not found alien life.  This results in a very frightening conclusion that there must be a [Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) at some point that acts as an impassable barrier.  Often, this is speculated something like a biological filter—such as the jump from one to multicellular organisms, or where a civilization develops the capacity to destroy itself through nuclear warfare and then promptly does so... 


But what if the filter is not resource depletion, biological hurdles, or nuclear holocaust, but what if it is instead an *economic filter*?


We can easily see that government’s grow to whatever size they are allowed to grow by economic reality.  That is, governments grow and grow, inefficiently consuming resources and inhibition progress, but eventually they seem to hit a wall and collapse as inflationary pressures build under the economic pressure of poor financial management until people exit that currency in favor of another.  In other words, government’s ability to continue grow is limited only by their ability to maintain control over the economy they parasitically leech off of.  We can imagine a situation where a failing government that has full control over what currency its underlying economy uses to the point where they could prevent people from switching to another fallback currency, and thus short circuiting the hyperinflation failsafe that keeps government economically constrained from the runaway destruction of resources.


It is fairly clear that the monetary trend before Bitcoin was toward centralization and digitization—e.g. the European countries transitioning to use the Euro.  Eventually, this would have resulted in a currency monopoly (as money is a natural monopolistic market), of which some governmental body would have absolute control.  In this situation, with no breaker-like failsafe in the form of hyperinflation, it is reasonable to conclude such government would grow and grow until it strangles the underlying economy past the point of what would be hyperinflation failure into what is a more permanent economic death that spirals into a socialist dystopia until there is no productivity left for the parasite to leech off of.  


But we have Bitcoin, so that scenario can never happen here on our planet.  Perhaps other alien worlds developed a comparable level of technological advancement only to have all of that progress destroyed by some alien version of Karl Marx and authoritarian governments that forced economic control upon their alien worlds through control of whatever centralized currency they used to the point of total annihilation.  What if we passed the Great Filter in 2009?

How will running a full node protect against this attack vector?,"What if a 51% attack is done using a soft fork? Let's say a 51% or higher miner uses a soft fork to change the rules such that every block is empty and all transactions are validated through an extension block the merkel root of which is embedded in the coinbase transaction. This way the effective block size is increased without the full node's consent.

This way all old nodes will blindly follow and will no longer be able to spend their funds unless they upgraded to the new soft fork rules.

# Introduction

OneLedger is a cross\-ledger agnostic protocol that enables high\-performance scaling using a sharded and modified practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus scheme \- which allows for either a permissionless or permissioned setting. By coupling public key infrastructure \(PKI\) with identity management, nodes \(and node operators\) will have a defined trust hierarchy that allows them to participate in the consensus of the OneLedger chain or any sidechain. OneLedger sidechains can be synchronized with the current state of other networks \(Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.\). Any cryptocurrency that supports hashed time lock contracts \(HTLC\) and payment channels could be deposited into an account or address with the amount credited onto the OneLedger sidechain.

#  The Architecture

OneLedger enables you to focus building your business application through OneLedger modularization tools, which will communicate with OneLedger protocol using its API gateway. This mechanism will make your business application interact with different public and private blockchains synchronously through corresponding side chains implemented in OneLedger platform.

# 

# The Consensus

OneLedger defines a three\-layer consensus protocol to enable more effective integration of different blockchain applications. Business logic can be implemented by the first layer \- a configurable role\-based consensus protocol leveraging hierarchical grouping similar to the structure of Merkle Tree. The side chain consensus protocol can move consensus traffic from the main chain with public consensus to the side chain with high performance and efficiency. OneLedger block structure enables the synchronization and reference between the three\-layer consensus.

# Main functions of One Ledger

1. **Enterprise Blockchain Solution**

OneLedger forms a realizable and verifiable blockchain network which is modularized from real\-world functionality, based on the sharing and immunity mechanisms provided by blockchain techniques.

**2.Protocol\-based Blockchain Communication**

All transaction data and real source records are written into distributed nodes by validation mechanism of data sharing through OneLedger protocol. OneLedger protocol enables communication and access across the blockchain, and allows for deployment and extendability across various Blockchain networks.

**3. High\-performance Transaction**

High\-performance transactions enabled by a uniquely\-engineered role and arbitration mechanism allowing for storage of data in a hierarchical structure.

**4.Multi\-chain Runtime Support**

Focuses on providing a consistent runtime which is compatible with various blockchain protocols and application development stacks

# Conclusion

One Ledger is a solid project with a very solid team \- in fact this is the first time we've seen a team this strong. Their project scope and their experience and skillset are extremely well\-aligned.

The biggest challenge they will face is getting businesses to adopt blockchain \- but with the growth and hype around blockchain at this point \- that may not be as hard as it seems. I think this one is a winner.",1528220539,05/06/2018 17:42:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8osu8d/oneledger_from_a_non_dev_perspective/,1
Here's my idea to scale Bitcoin,"Bitcoin can be stored offline with a device such as a ledger. We could find a way to transfer funds to one another offline with a device like that which would keep track of all debits and credits and can be uploaded back on the web when connected. Because Bitcoin's supply is limited, this would be possible to keep all records accurate. What do you think?",1528220539,05/06/2018 17:42:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8osu8e/heres_my_idea_to_scale_bitcoin/,1

I don't save my money on bank account anymore - who else like me?,"I heared about Bitcoin when the price is about $200 - but at that time, I searched about it, and completely ignored it. It wasn't interesting for me at that time. As I am growing older and learning more about econimics as my hobby, my view has been changed.

So I revisited Bitcoin not that long ago - and then I figured out this is 'the sh1t'.  This is the next big thing.  I researched all cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies for couple monthes - I barely slept and ate while I was researching. Bitcoin blew my mind it's because it IS perfect technologically and economically. After that, I decided not to put my money on the bank. Saving money on the bank account doesn't really make sense. And also, I pulled out all my money from the stock market. I told this my parents, and they called me I am crazy haha (I haven't told this to all my friends though, and I think I won't). 

And for me, I don't really care about today's Bitcoin price. If the price goes up, it's good because I hold bitcoins. If the price goes down, it's good because I can buy more with the cheap price.

Plus, I decided not to tell this story to my friends - I am thinking about the future, and it can be very dangerous for me if I told to someone that I own single bitcoin.

This is just short story of my life.",1528221026,05/06/2018 17:50:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8oswn4/i_dont_save_my_money_on_bank_account_anymore_who/,1

Has there been any interest in a Bitcoin based video streaming service?,"With all the drama of YouTube demonizing non advertiser friendly content, wouldn’t this create an opportunity to create a video streaming site where viewers can pay content creators directly?

For example (using USD for simplicity, but this would be all done with BTC in the end), say you measure how many seconds someone viewed a video and you had to pay something minuscule like $0.0001 per second. If you watched an hour long Let’s Play video or something, you’d end up paying $0.36 to view this. If you watched 3
hours of video a day, you’d pay $1.08 per day or $32.40 per month.

Perhaps the $/second would go down the more you watch to encourage binging.

It seems like there wouldn’t be much demand for piracy since it’s such a small amount and it just wouldn’t be worth it. Although you would still have to address the issue of people stealing content and reuploading it to steal views.

Regarding creators, if a video had 500,000 views and on average only a third of the video was watched, the content creator would have gotten paid $60,000, and that’s just for that one video.

Perhaps you would have the option to view videos for free and at 320x480 and if you wanted higher resolutions that’s when it would start charging. 

Just some ideas. Obviously creating a video streaming site is no easy task, but it seems like it may be worth it to switch to this model rather than an ad supported model.

Winning over a new soul for bitcoin,"Hi all,

I’ve been reading into Bitcoin for a while and I’m quite confident about it’s future.

I’m having dinner with my little sister tomorrow, and I think it would be super awesome for her to be able to brag to her high school friends that she has some Bitcoin (+ it will help us spread the word, right?)

So, how can I easily set her up with a wallet on her phone? 

Oh and by the way, she tends to lose her phone every once in a while so we need to make sure she doesn’t lose the BTC with it.

I know it’s a total noob question and probably described in tons of places, but I’m curious to read your responses. And I’m a proud big brother, just a little bit of bragging here

Potential avenue of anti-Bitcoin propaganda - how to counter it?,"Economic sanctions on countries like North Korea and Russia are seen as a way to influence politics and ""negotiate"". For example, a link on r/worldnews is talking about a Russian oligarch's assets being frozen in a Swiss bank: [https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8osnq1/swiss_banks_freeze_1bln_of_russian_oligarchs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8osnq1/swiss_banks_freeze_1bln_of_russian_oligarchs/)

I made a comment saying how ridiculous it is that banks can just freeze an individual's account, and that it's not really your money if its in a bank, it's already being downvoted. I have also seen comments about BTC in previous threads about Venezuelan sanctions and articles about NK using BTC to bypass sanctions. 

I foresee that when BTC gets bigger this will be a strong avenue for anti-BTC propaganda by the mainstream media. They will push the ""terrorists use BTC to bypass banking"" and ""the evil Kremlin is using crypto to bypass sanctions"" etc etc. I somewhat think that the recent anti-Russian propaganda in the US media is actually just a setup for the anti-BTC propaganda that might follow so they can combine the two and lead it into ""we must ban BTC"" at some point.

How can this be countered effectively so the average person doesn't fall for it? I am thinking that major Western gov'ts turning against crypto is one of the main challenges it faces, and I want to prepare in case it happens to promote the success of BTC itself, not just price (though price will likely take a hit if mainstream media turns against BTC, this is a probability in my eyes, its when not if)

What is concerning to me is general hostility of the ""normies"" towards BTC - ""it uses too much electricity"" and the above that I mentioned. This information warfare is currently being won as the mainstream is being conditioned to have a hostile view of BTC, so that when the time comes the people will support a ban. I am concerned about this and wanted to start a discussion about how we can educate or expose this propaganda, and make sure that people who don't understand BTC don't turn against it.",1528234533,05/06/2018 21:35:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ousus/potential_avenue_of_antibitcoin_propaganda_how_to/,1

Big use case soon. My first LN proj,"So I had this crazy project idea which I will share this time next month.  
something 'entertaining' and informative that might be a new way we share.  
The emotional quotient of this project might be pretty high. We'll see.

Point is I'm learning hot to install LN as I needed a micropayment system without any counter party risk.

So I'm watching tutorials now and figuring out how to integrate it.. I hope I can RPC to it?  Which version should I use?

I will be running linux and bitcoind full node hopefully i can rpc to it and it's straight forward. 

The reason I'm posting this here other than asking for tips , versions etc..  is once you dig into this even a bit possibilities start flooding.  Try youtubing info on lightning and watch a few during your coffee sessions.. Personally I think non federated 'side chain' will 10x what lightning can do without some of the constraints but I think we need something soft forked in fo rthis to happen?

So any tips on LN versions and any idea what bitcoin is lacking in order to do NON federated side chains?

Anyway, you can earn using bisq simply make offers (add liquidity).

At least until the volume picks up but that's the point isn't it?

One Thing that Excites Me about the Future of Bitcoin Mining,"As we know, the amount of power required to mine Bitcoin is high. Mining companies are looking for the optimum places to mine Bitcoin, where electricity is cheap. I believe they will have to come up with innovative ways to cut costs and the most innovate way would be to invest in the use solar, wind, hydro, etc. to cut electrical usage costs in the long run. This could completely change our energy sector! Imagine deserts filled with solar panels with huge mining facilities, windy prairie lands with wind farms, riverside mining with hydro, the list goes on.

People don't seem to be motivated to change our energy solutions because of environmental impact. But once it becomes an economical decision, it's a free for all. I can't wait to see what becomes of this new industrial revolution we call Bitcoin.",1528257046,06/06/2018 03:50:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8oxhwu/one_thing_that_excites_me_about_the_future_of/,1

"10% in BTC, 2% BCH, 12% mutual funds and 76% in FIAT","My current assets divided in percentages.

I believe it's a good mix, but I am willing to increase exposure with another 5% in crypto this year. I do would like recommendations or advice on why more BTC over other alt coins.

I have no debt, removed all credit cards and mostly pay everything with one of my two debit cards.

I am looking towards going more into crypto as I've loaded up my wallets with BTC and BCH and just looking at starting to use it more on a daily basis. I will replenish everything I spend in crypto with FIAT money through an exchange (I currently use Bitstamp.net).

I am excited about this as I do sincerely believe in the future; one does not need FIAT conversions at all, just as a price reference as there always will be people and government in need to nominate prices (I don't think BTC or any other crypto will take over that part, yet). 

Any advice and ways to use money online and offline (I use a lot Amazon online and currently spends a lot of time in Mexico).

How does mining work? (And some other questions),"I have read in different places it's math problems, something about prime numbers and how those multiply to specific numbers that it takes a very long time to undo, that it's something about 0s, and also something about hashing.  

My understanding of hashing is it's basically one way encryption. So how is that math problems ( I know bitcoin is on the sha-256 algorithm but I don't know what that means). I would really like to know what mining means in depth.  

I have the opportunity to teach my class about the history of currency tomorrow, but I thought it would be fun if I taught about bitcoin. I have a vague grasp and would prefer to have a more solid understanding if I'm going to teach it to others in an effort to avoid sharing misinformation.  

I included it was created by an anonymous person under the pseudonym of Satoshi nakomoto and I plan on doing a little activity demonstrating a ledger but I'm not really sure why they should care or what else they should know.

First week owning bitcoin. What a wild ride!,"When my last paycheck came in, I decided to take the plunge and purchase some bitcoin. A whole £50's worth! and boy has it been exciting. 

Seriously though, I know a lot of people here have huge amounts at stake, but I'm really enjoying learning something new and being part of a community of people with a huge array of opinions. 

I'm planning on making monthly purchases of around the same amount while I learn the ropes.

I love this concept! First heard it articulated by Saifedean Ammous.,"Bitcoins value proposition is NOT fast transactions. Cash is instant, people in sub-saharan Africa send money over sms, developed nations use tap and pay credit cards. No one is buying bitcoin to get faster transactions.

Bitcoins value proposition is NOT cheap transactions. Cash is free, merchants pay credit card fees, national bank transfers are free, international wires can be done over ""transferwise"" and the like for next to nothing. No one is buying bitcoin to get cheaper transactions.

Bitcoins value proposition is NOT that its ""digital"". 90% + of fiat money is already digital. Nothing more than an entry in a data base. No one is buying bitcoin because its digital, infact trying to understand the digital nature of bitcoin turns more people away than it attracts.

It is fantastic that bitcoin is fast, cheap, digital, uncensorable etc etc. But bitcoin really has only one value proposition, and it is extremely important.

Bitcoin is the only asset on earth that is strictly scarce, its supply cannot be diluted. Bitcoins value proposition is its immutable unchangeable monetary policy of a set issuance rate and set total supply.

Everyone buying bitcoin is buying for this one reason whether they realise it or not. Afterall who would buy bitcoin if new bitcoins could be created arbitrarily at whim. No one. Even bitcoins price appreciation is due entirely to the fact excess supply cannot rise as demand rises, supply issuance rate is set in stone.

Once people start to wake up to the fact that bitcoin is the only strictly scarce asset on earth whos supply cannot increase with more time or effort like every other resource the implications will be profound.

Everyone is running around trying to understand why bitcoin is important or why it will work or why they even bought some in the first place. The answer is this one reason. Its supply is absolutely strictly limited. If you own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin today you will still own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin in 50 years from now. No one can dilute the supply.

Bitcoins immutability is the foundation of this whole technological movement. Any coin that can fork at will is not immutable. The fast cheap payments will come and one day will be used all around the world, but the value today is solely in bitcoins immutable monetary policy.

If anyone asks you what bitcoin is. Tell them ""Bitcoin is the worlds ONLY liquid asset whos supply cannot be increased as demand rises. Bitcoin is the ONLY strictly scarce asset on earth.""

My Experience Using Bitcoin to Purchase Hotel Through Expedia.com,"I just recently went on a vacation which I will not go into detail about. What I do want to talk about is the experience I had in purchasing my hotel room through expedia.com using Bitcoin. 

First let me explain the process. Expedia uses coinbase as a merchant tool. Whenever you purchase something through Expedia coinbase allocates you 15 minutes for at least one confirmation to go through before your transaction is completed. If you do not get a confirmation within this 15 minutes the item you are purchasing will be reset and a new Bitcoin address for your purchase will be issued. 

But you've already broadcast your first transaction which will still be sent to expedia's coinbase account. So now you're looking for a refund on that first tx and the only way to get that refund is by creating a coinbase account or logging into your existing and accessing the refund from there. I repeat no refunds are sent to an external address, they are sent to a coinbase Bitcoin address. 

So I'm on Expedia. I send my 1st tx, doesn't confirm in 15 minutes, invoice resets. Send 2nd tx, doesn't confirm, invoice resets. Send 3rd tx, doesn't confirm, invoice resets. Send 4th tx and finally confirms, invouce completed, but I've sent 3 times as much Bitcoin that I need too and I'm now owed 3 refunds. 

I contact expedia customer support to see how this is done. Customer support claims they only owe me 2 refunds and that they are not seeing that failed invoice for the 3rd tx. I receive 2 refunds into my coinbase account which I haven't used in over a year. I tell customer service they still owe me for my 3rd failed tx. I provide details about it and guy tells me he will contact customer support at coinbase to see what happened. He says give him 24-48 hours. 

By this time I've got my room booked and 2 refunds, I'm still owed 1 refund. The 2 refunds that went to my coinbase account are locked for 3 days while coinbase verifies some crap. I receive a generic response 2 days after my purchase from Expedia customer support stating that coinbase will not issue refund for 3rd failed tx. Expedia tells me to contact customer support at coinbase. I decide to do that later. 

So after this last call with expedia I'm sitting down eating and I receive 3 new emails. ""Expedia Inc has sent you *** bitcoin"". Okay... I check my coinbase account and now I have a total of 5 refunds. I check Expedia and my reservations are still set. I call hotel and it's all in the system. 

The extra refunds are sitting in my coinbase account. The 3 refunds I was owed I withdrew. Should I keep it or give it back to this huge corporation that wasted about 3-4 hours of my time on phone with customer support people?

Tldr; Expedia uses a shitty merchant tool which forces people to use coinbase because that's where all refunds are sent. I was owed 3 refunds for tx not confirmed in 15 minutes. 4th tx went through I got my room. Expedia issued 2 refunds. I complained about not getting 3rd refund. Days later They send 3 additional refunds. I've got a total of 5 refunds and a booked room.",1528292946,06/06/2018 13:49:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8p0r0e/my_experience_using_bitcoin_to_purchase_hotel/,1

How fast can bitcoin hashrate grow???,"We have just seen hashrate grow 5 exahash in just 2 weeks

That's compared to 370 000x Antminer S9's

370k units!

Can Bitmain produce this amount of Antminers in 2 weeks? Can all industry combined produce such a number of ASICs in 2 weeks?

What's happening? I feel like we miners are being fooled

Just a year ago all industry produced 0.4 exahash a month (not two weeks!). Though we already had Antminer S9 in mass-production.

Are these 7nm units? But they could give a maximum of 2x hashrate boost, but this is 10x boost.

Are these some warehouse stocks accumulated by Bitmain in 2016 when mining equipment was not in such demand?

Does anybody have understanding?",1528297941,06/06/2018 15:12:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8p1ej7/how_fast_can_bitcoin_hashrate_grow/,1

Good analogy for PoW energy usage?,"I came up with an analogy as a counter to people who criticise Bitcoin for its energy usage.  Does it make sense/work? 


Saying Bitcoin mining is wasting huge amounts of energy is like saying Uber is a huge contributor to greenhouse gasses. Of course you could naively count how many tonnes of CO2 is released by Uber driver by the number of journeys they take, but many people take Uber when they would otherwise drive their own car, so in fact it’s more efficient. Furthermore, many Uber drivers use electric cars since it’s cheaper to run.

I think the analogy works well because the alternative to Bitcoin is the current global fiat system with huge vaults, large banks, armoured vehicles transporting cash etc. Also, much of Bitcoin mining is done with renewable energy since it’s cheaper than burning fuel.


Someone has probably made this comparison before, but I wanted to check with you guys if the analogy holds before touting it too much. Thanks",1528299676,06/06/2018 15:41:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8p1mug/good_analogy_for_pow_energy_usage/,1

## One of the attractors of cryptocurrencies is the alleged anonymity of transactions they’re used for. But this feature is illusory in many cases. Could you explain how so?

*The underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies is blockchain, which is the communication protocol between cryptocurrency and counterparties. The open, decentralized ledgers are made to secure transactions in a verifiable and permanent way. Although specific names are not available, the public ledgers create and show records each time money is sent or received, allowing transactions to have „public witnesses.” The integrity of communication is extremely reliable, as the shared database is encrypted, protecting it from tampering, revision, or deletion.*

Transactions are recorded and made public, but they are only linked with an electronic address that cannot be traced. However, contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin and many other types of digital currencies are not anonymous. Bitcoin is pseudonymous. Each identity is tied to a public key, which consists of a long string of numbers that act as a Bitcoin address...*

Petro-Bitcoin,"Petro\-Yuan. Economies sell commodities for Yuan, then use the Yuan on Shanghai and purchase physical Gold. This causes a speedy transfer from the Petro\-Dollar and so empowering  China, through the Yuan, and large holders of physical Gold, countries like Russia. Meanwhile countries like the US, who's Fort Knox is empty and so her global manipulation and warmongering through her dollar wanes.  The US dollars return home, flooding her economy and so setting off a deep hyper\-inflationary  depression. Humanity is then owned by Putin and Xi Jinping, rather than Trump.

Keeping a secret in the blockchain and reveal it only if a transaction is made,"I have this idea stuck in my mind but I'm starting to think it's may be impossible to realize on the bitcoin blockchain... 

I would like to store a small secret in the blockchain in such a way that whoever wants to see it, needs to make a transaction from a particular bitcoin address. (I will supply the private key privately).

The main reason: I will monitor this address and I will therefore know when the secret has been ""opened"".

How do you protect your Bitcoin wallet?,"How to protect your crypto wallet

Security is going to be the main feature of the blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed data storage software that makes impossible to lose information even if part of network is down. It also encrypts the data so that you are the only one with access to it. There is about blockchain technology in general. But there are some security points that should be outlined in different ways of holding cryptocurrency. 

Online services

The first rule is to be careful to different online services. Most of exchanges and online wallets do not provide enough insurance and security to be used to store money like a bank. They often suffer from hacker attacks. Accordingly, you might want to use other types of wallets. For example, hardware or software client-side wallets as Lumi. Otherwise, you should choose such services very carefully. However if you want to choose hosted wallets you are to mind safety and use additional security features as two-factor authentication (2FA).

Choose client-side wallet

Let’s speak about software client side wallets in details. Why is it more secure? It means that there are no processes connecting with your personal data happen online. Consequently, your funds are vulnerable to losses only if you don’t take care of your device (means don’t use password on your device, give to third parties or lose it).  

Backup

The second rule is about backup for your wallet. It can protect you against computer failures and many human mistakes. It allows you to recover your wallet after your mobile or computer was stolen if you have a wallet backup. For example, Lumi provides you with 12-words mnemonic phrase that is a key to your funds. With this phrase you can recover your wallet in Lumi or into another wallet.

Update in time

The third rule is to keep your wallet up to date. Updates include new useful security features and help to keep your wallet safe. Wallet teams always work hard for their clients.

Diversify your risks

As for general advice, it is better not to store all your funds in one exchange or in one hot wallet. Diversify your risks. Or choose cold wallets. Keep your phone safe and take care of your private key.",1528358281,07/06/2018 07:58:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8p8i9j/how_do_you_protect_your_bitcoin_wallet/,1

Bitcoin Value Inflation at 4% in 2018 - Store of Value,"Due to the mining process Bitcoin has a current inflation rate of 4% pa. in 2018. So relativ to the Dollar (roughly 2%) it is inflating by 2%. That means the Dollar is, kind of, the better store of Value right now, disregarding all the flaws of the dollar system and the adoption of btc?! 

By 2021 the inflation will drop below 2% for Bitcoin. And probably will be lower than Dollars. 

From my understanding this is the first time Bitcoin can be seen as a store of value compared to the dollar.

Full Data Security and Anonymity with the Adamant Messenger,"Is it possible to communicate anonymously on the Internet today? A positive answer to this question is given by the creators of the ADAMANT messenger, which is designed to make a revolution in security and anonymity of Internet communications.
The Conception of the ADAMANT project

ADAMANT is a system for message and data transfers based on an independent secure blockchain, which is available from any device. ADAMANT has an integrated payment system that allows making payment and transfer of tokens directly within the chat.

ADAMANT is also useful for business communications. Thus, the corporate system for message and document transfers ADAMANT Business will provide the opportunity to digitally-sign them, and an integrated payment system will reduce internal transactional costs. So, ADAMANT combines security, anonymity, and convenience.

In the case of the ADAMANT messenger, the use of Ethereum blockchain is not suitable, that is due to the relatively high value of “gas” (transactions’ fee) required for each Ethereum transaction, including all message transfers. In this regard, ADAMANT is built on an independent blockchain, that allows significantly reduce the message transfer cost, and adjust it depending on the future token price.

In addition, Proof of Work technology is also not used in the project due to the high cost of such infrastructure maintaining, and with the growth in transactions’ fee as the number of participants increases. As a result, a program code of the Lisk project was used for the realization of the server part and the blockchain itself, which was extended to obtain the required functionality.

The ADAMANT messenger has enough flexible architecture, that allows making changes to transactions’ fee, if necessary. The project also differs with a fully decentralized system that is based on the algorithm with Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus (DPoS), which allows reliable confirmation of transactions within the 5 seconds (a critical time for fast messaging and payment execution). Using DPoS also reduces the system maintenance cost, because, compared to PoW, this does not require vast computing powers and barbaric electricity consumption. The use of DPoS also makes the ADAMANT system highly scalable and reliable.

At the moment, the ADAMANT project has a ready product, which is presented as a progressive web application (PWA) for most browsers. The messenger works stably on iOS 9+ and Android 5.0+, has a concise design that is quite functional and fully performs its tasks.

Due to the fact that within the messenger there are transactions’ fees that are necessary for the network maintenance, for freely try of ADAMANT features a certain amount of “welcome” tokens is charged to the user.

ADAMANT – The Most Secure and Anonymous Messenger – Encrypted Within The Blockchain,"ADAMANT is a Blockchain-based system for data and message transfers along with an integrated payment system are providing a truly fundamental benefits for all-personal and business-like communications.

The ADAMANT team has done in depth research on the available messenger systems like Telegram, WhatsApp etc before they decided to create their truly anonymous messenger. As you can see in the table below you can see the many elements that are, or should be, part of a secure anonymous user friendly messenger. The table only shows the key players, the community manager told me the left out some other big players. But if you ask him he can explain the difference between every messenger and their product. Considering the market of messengers, the segment demanding truly communicate anonymous with ease is huge!

ADAMANT &amp; Technology

ADAMANT is a fully decentralized system that is based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus (DPoS) algorithm. This choice was made in order to meet the following criteria:

● DPoS allows for any transaction to be reliably confirmed within the 5 second interval. This time is critical for fast messaging and payment execution;

● DPoS dramatically lowers the system maintenance cost — there is no need for vast computing powers and therefore — barbaric electricity waste, comparing to POW;

● Fixed transaction fees;

● Dignified system scalability and reliability factors.

Unfortunately all modern use cases of the Ethereum blockchain are not quite suitable for maintaining the ADAMANT network. This is determined by a relatively high value of “gas” (transactions’ fee), that is used for every Ethereum transaction, including all message transfers. This is why ADAMANT is built on an independent blockchain — hence the transactions’ costs could be low enough to operate the whole network and they could also be adjusted based on the future rising token price.

Moreover, Proof of Work technology in not suitable either, because its maintenance cost is high, and with the grow of participants’ amount the transactions’ fee is rising up quickly. Considering these reasons a program code of the Lisk project is being used for realization of the server part and the blockchain itself. This source code was extended in order to obtain the required functional.

The ADAMANT architecture is flexible enough for allowing us to make changes to transactions’ fee, if needed.

The fact that the team really took a in depth research in the technological base is a good sign the team is able to both think of the current requirements as well as of the features desired for the further development of its platform. Since the chosen technology and the way the product is set up the platform could be trusted/used by the whole world, which is a huge target market!

USA Tax Deferral on Dec. 2017 Gains (sale of bitcoin),"With the filing deadline passed; I'm sure no one is thinking about taxes - but there is a new development with tax reform that is very time sensitive. The IRS updated the [FAQ](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions) today to indicate that the tax on gain on sale can be deferred by investing in a QO Fund, even if you already filed your 2017 return.

**BUT** you must invest the gain amount into a QO Fund within 180 days. Effectively this means that only gains on/after 12/9/17 can be invested (as of today)

Why invest in a QO Fund? Highlights:

- Deferral of tax until QO Fund investment sold or 12/31/26
- 10% basis step up yr. 5
- 5% basis step up yr. 7
- *Exclusion of any additional gain if the investment is held for 10 yrs*

Hope this saves some tax dollars

Honest question about LN,"I'm having trouble understanding an element of how the Lightning Network works. I think I get the core idea; you create a channel, put money in it, and the transactions stay confined to that channel, where transactions resolve almost instantly. Eventually you close the channel and resolve it back to the main chain, and the btc settles to its rightful owners.

But since the channel has to be created WITH the person you're paying - does that mean you basically have to open a new channel for every store you want to use? If I walk into a random bar, do I have to take a moment to set up the channel at the door? If that's the case, how does this really solve the issues with everyday use? Is keeping a tab open at all the stores I frequent really a good solution for slow payments? I hate having a ton of credit cards and a ton of rewards cards and blah blah... I don't particularly want to have to park sats in a Grocery Store channel, a Pharmacy channel, a channel for my three favorite bars, etc., just to be able to spend btc in my day-to-day life. (And would I also tend to want to make those piles of parked sats as large as possible so I can minimize the frequency I have to resolve it back to the chain - that is, minimize transaction fees?)

Curious if anyone has thoughts on this or can explain a better model for understanding it.",1528390184,07/06/2018 16:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pbw3r/honest_question_about_ln/,1

So cost of hardware = 33156509,223 * 2400$ / 14 = 5,683,973,010 $

Antminers required = 5,683,973,010 / 2400 = 2368322 ANTMINERS

Cost of electricity = 0.05$ per 1 kW/s
So, the power = 2368322 * 1.375 kW/s * 0.05$ = 162822$ per (second or hour ? since 1.375 kW per second)

And if we follow my logic, per day the power will cost = 162822$ * (60*60*24) = 14,067,820,800$

Adamant Personal &amp; Decentralized Messenger,"If you’re a privacy-sensitive individual, it most likely feels like a terrific deal, and perhaps even too good to be true.

Though not prepared but, Adamant is getting ready each an Android and an iOS cellular software that can allow us to have entry to the whole service wherever we’re.
What’s the catch?

Each message despatched by way of the service has a token value connected to it. zero.005 ADM to be exact. Personally, I believe it’s a truthful worth to pay for sending a very encrypted, safe, and untrackable message.

The token makes use of a DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) system to generate new tokens and so they have the whole scheme outlined of their whitepaper. There you may also study extra concerning the system, the brand new blockchain, and the staff behind this wonderful mission.

"Coinbase released over $39,000 of my coins while my account was locked Case 3792110","If anyone at Coinbase is reading this I would appreciate a resolution to my case refunding me the money that was stolen from my account while the SERVER at Coinbase was HIJACKED in February 2018.  I have been trying unsuccessfully to reach the investigator on my case at coinbase.  I have submitted five times the requested documents.  The first four submissions went into ""Coinbase's black hole."" Each time I call Coinbase the supervisors refuse to speak to me, leaving me talking to a customer service representative.  

On February 21, 2018 while on a 15 minute hold with Coinbase, my Coinbase account and my personal computers were remotely accessed through highjacking the Coinbase server. I do not believe that when I spoke to a representative at Coinbase that I was even speaking to Coinbase.  The representative told me that he could ""whitelist"" my google authenicator codes at the coinbase server end so that I could get access into my accounts and transfer my money to my USD bank.

At that time I was new to the crypto\-currency world and have since learned that this was not what would have been told to me.  He was unsuccessful multiple times in trying  to white list the account.  My account was permantely locked and in order to re\-access my funds I was required to resubmit my drivers license and a photo.  While I was waiting on a response from Coinbase,  I learned through the investigation that my computers were remotely accessed and programs were remotely installed.

 I have provided Coinbase with a detail log of the hijackers activity while they were in my account.  My account was locked and there should have been no way of transferring my coins.  

I am looking for a favorable resolution of the refund of the coins stolen.  ",1528394637,07/06/2018 18:03:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pcik7/coinbase_released_over_39000_of_my_coins_while_my/,1

Why this year Bitcoin will explode to new ATH,First of all bitcoin is already in use all the time. Some people like to use it as a currency which it isn't but that isn't what gives its true value. The entire altcoin market relies on trading pairs with bitcoin/eth. With new ATH ICO's and altcoins being created guess what they require to function at all??? That's right Bitcoin! Exchanges that will be able to trade any crypto for fiat or crypto to crypto are going to be at least a year away so the demand for Bitcoin will only increase dramatically until it isn't required to trade with. Then in 2 years Bitcoin can die peacefully instead of taking the entire market down with it.,1528397369,07/06/2018 18:49:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pcwc3/why_this_year_bitcoin_will_explode_to_new_ath/,1

We have the world's attention, now we must build the network. An expert at setting up Lightning transactions for everyday companies around town will be a very lucrative profession. Let's get busy. It took me a while to find Bitcoin's source code and learning material that inspired/helped him design the software. It's written in C++ and is all on nakamotoinstitute.org.

A article is deemed for release from an industry 'insider' that bitcoin will go below 3k in the coming weeks. He who shall go unnamed worked in the math lab at MIT and literally has predicted every single up and down through equations. More below:,"When he deemed it to rise he put his mouth in his equations by purchasing 1000s of coins a little over a year ago which was over half of his retirement.  He was all in.  Then he predicted via math and his algorithm that it would hit the 17-19k range and he sold all of it at 18k which he suggest his followers to do the same.  

This was the main reason for the drop in Bitcoin months ago because &lt;150 people sold millions worth of bitcoin.  From this he now states that bitcoin will go &lt;3k, stabilize for a while (1-5 weeks) then it will drop further.  All other coins will follow suit while some coins at this time will be worth more than Bitcoin.  He wouldn't comment on what coins specifically will be worth more but noted with a bit of research it can be easily found.

He suggest if you're holding still at this point your'e foolish and you should sell now.

He currently has 1 coin left that he keeps as a memento.",1528416589,08/06/2018 00:09:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pfblv/a_article_is_deemed_for_release_from_an_industry/,1

Am I Doing Something Wrong? (Electrum Wallet - Incorrect Password),"I made an electrum wallet this morning, with the intention of finally getting my bitcoin off of Coinbase and into an actual wallet. I made an electrum wallet, and encrypted it with a password. I made sure to write down this password, as well as my seed for future use. 

Before transferring any actual coin into the wallet, i closed the wallet, and upon re-opening, the password i created specifically for this wallet no longer works. The app just keeps telling me i’v entered an incorrect password. 

I know for a fact i’m entering the correct password in, (no, caps lock was not on by accident). When i created the password i typed it out in note, and screen capped it. I then copied this password from note into the password creation field, so i don’t believe i’m entering the wrong password. 

Its not a big deal if i never regain access to this wallet because it has nothing in it, but i would like to understand what i might have done wrong so i can avoid this in the future. 

Any thoughts on the issue?",1528422898,08/06/2018 01:54:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pg1gx/am_i_doing_something_wrong_electrum_wallet/,1

Twitter Sock Puppets,"Has anyone had this issue on Twitter? Over at r / btc they act like everything with bitcoin especially over here is censored or there are paid bots but it seems to me that the bcash marketers are guilty of it. If Ver makes false statements and then blocks everyone who disagrees with him that creates a false impression most of twitter agrees with Ver. But he or his employees are curating a very biased set of replies.

A while ago I called out @bitcoin for copy pasting tweets from @BitcoinUnlimit from one thread to another. Then all the sudden @bitcoin, @rogerkver, @BitcoinUnlimit all block me at once. I replied to Ver a lot and never to @bitcoinUnlimit. It shouldn't even know who I am at all but it must have been added to the team's list.

Monacoin withdrawal still offline on livecoin after attack," ""

Dear clients, as you all know, MONA network has been attacked recently, and all the exchanges suffered at some point due to fake incoming transactions. The fact of attack has been publicly acknowledged by the developers.

We contacted the developers several times on the issues concerning the cancellation of fake transactions or providing compensations for the losses sustained by the exchanges as a result of the hackers' attack on MONA blockchain. Today we got an answer: the developers won't take any actions. We, in our turn, have nothing to do than keep MONA deposit/withdrawal closed, in accordance with the terms of services providing. If the developers of MONA will ever take steps to cover the losses, incurred by the attack on the blockchain, we would be glad to make this asset available again. If you want to influence the situation somehow, please, send collective claims to MONA developers. ""

LN-enabled ride-sharing app,"Could someone please implement a protocol and mobile app for ride-sharing with minimal counterparty risk? The driver's app sends tariff details (rate per units of distance and waiting time, upfront fee) to the client's app. If the client accepts, their app pays the upfront fee and the first unit of distance. After each unit of distance or waiting time, the driver's app bills another unit. The client's app uses the phone's clock and GPS to verify that another payment is in fact due and pays up.

trying bisq for the first time,"so i am attempting my first BTC purchase via bisq.

the first thing that i notice is that you already need to have some BTC in order to buy BTC.  at least for the payment method that i have chosen (SEPA).  you have to put a small amount of bitcoin into escrow.  so for somebody wanting to acquire bitcoin for the first time, this transaction wouldn't work.

i saw a couple of sellers.  one seller whose account was zero days old, offering a good price.  and another whose account was 90 days old, charging a much higher margin.  i went with the first guy, i guess there is a risk that he will reverse the SEPA transfer.  also i think he chose the mediators (or whatever they are called) and not me, i don't know what prevents him from setting up two fake mediator accounts and choosing those.  i am spending an amount that i can afford to lose.

i am also wondering if my bank will have a problem with the transaction, for example if the seller is already blacklisted.  i am not using my main bank account for this, i'm using a throwaway account that i have at another bank.

so let's see how it goes...",1528463032,08/06/2018 13:03:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pjphm/trying_bisq_for_the_first_time/,1

Why is Bitcoin deflationary?,"After doing some research and analysis, my conclusions are:

1) halving of block rewards every 4 years. If we assume buy demand for Bitcoins doesn't change much, then supply decrease will lead to market price increase, eventually leading to a price bubble as people try to buy their share of Bitcoins before others get a chance.

2) loss of Bitcoins due to lost private keys, causing supply to permanently decrease. As some buyers won't be able to liquidate their share of Bitcoins.

"If money is a language, Bitcoin is English","There are a lot of languages in the world.  Some languages have died out because no one really uses it anymore.  But English - is the language that is globally accepted.  Think about it - even people, who never live in English speaking country, know 'Yes' and 'No' (or 'Thank you').  Plus, asian countries (they have own language) use English in academic research papers.
  Why? Because English is the only language that widely used (not just in one continent).

Moreover, the language 'English' is the gateway for other languages. The first foreign language people learn is mostly English.  Of course people don't need to learn English first, and they can learn different languages (altcoins) - but everywhere in the world uses/knows English.  So it's good to know English.

If money is a language, Bitcoin is English.  It's a gateway for other altcoins.  You don't need to use Bitcoin, but you probably want to hold a little bit of Bitcoin since it IS accepted globally. 
 I do not see any exchange that doesn't accept Bitcoin.

However, I **do not think** Bitcoin would be the only currency, but I **do believe** Bitcoin will be the currency that will be accepted by EVERYONE.",1528474958,08/06/2018 16:22:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pl9ny/if_money_is_a_language_bitcoin_is_english/,1

This is why it is good that scaling bitcoin takes time.,"Nothing of value is ever fast and easy. Infact if something is fast and easy it is definitively not valuable, as human value of everything is always determined by our most valuable resource, time itself.

If anyone thinks they can bootstrap an altcoin within one year that will be better than bitcoin becuase of higher throughput they are delusional.

Bitcoin took a long time to prove out its decentralisation, it took a long time to prove out its ability to store value, it took a long time to prove out trustless operation and it will take a long time to prove out scaling issues.

Trying to artificially engineer out this process with the newest consensus algorithm or scaling solution based on scrificing decentralization is delusional.

Time itself is the value bitcoin holds. No other alt coin can compete with this especially if they are taking shortcuts to try and engineer out the process of ""time proving"".",1528476608,08/06/2018 16:50:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8plhxc/this_is_why_it_is_good_that_scaling_bitcoin_takes/,1

What prevents ISPs from performing a MITM attack?,"In the case of using Bitocin over tor, an attacker can set up his own tor exit nodes and bitcoin nodes, get the few good acting Tor exit nodes banned which will force the user to use the attacker's for exit nodes as they are the only ones unbanned and then because the exit node is able to see the communication between itself and the final destination, and because bitcoin connects are not encrypted, the attacker could redirect the user to his own bitcoin node and have the node reject his transactions.

What prevents an ISP from doing similar? If I am running Bitcoin on my PC and want to send out a transactio, my ISP is acting similarly to a tor exit node right? What prevents the ISP from intercepting my bitcoin connection packet to their own node?",1528479069,08/06/2018 17:31:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pltxt/what_prevents_isps_from_performing_a_mitm_attack/,1

What BTC adoption in countries like Venezuela does for community and overall value of the coin?,"I see bitcoin being used for all of the right reasons in cases like these and for that I am thankful! My question is how drastically does this affect the overall value of the coin, yes it has become almost the norm in places like these but since the value of their currency is so low does that even put a dent into the market cap and trade volume? I’m sorry if these are ignorant questions, I’m just curious.... I’m looking towards mass adoption in the future(eventually) but is it going to be started through third world countries completely making the switch or through integration into everyday lives in places where bitcoin is already catching the eye of big investment firms and bankers....

Bitfinex has frozen my account with more than 500 BTC,"Hello, I am a user of Bitflinex. I had a terrible situation - my account was blocked nearly 5 months ago.

I received the following letter on my e-mail: Your account activity has triggered a number of automated risk flags in our platform. This in itself is not a big problem, however when this happens we wish the user to provide some information in order to understand the user's account history and objectives...

The support of the exchange wrote it was just a simple verification of identity. But the problem has taken more than 5 months already and I can’t stand it and wait anymore. Every time the support of the exchange demanded new proofs and varifications. Though, they could make one list with all the requirements at once. They did it on purpose to play for time and not to get my account unblocked. After 3 months of long intercourse correspondence I fulfilled all the requirements for verification of my identity, KYC verification and the origin of my money. But my account is still blocked, the last message from Bitflinex support I received 2 months ago. Since then there has been no more reply.

Join Us or Suppport Our Local Bitcoin Trading Business,"Hi all, I know this might not sound good to do this here. But at the moment I have no choice than to present my worry in front of you.

I and my friend started a platform for Cryptocurrency news and later on got into sales of bitcoins. We got in contact with someone in the Uk who told us he could supply us with bitcoin for us to start selling in our market. 

Unfortunately, the guy took the little capital we raised and vanished. He keeps on writing and apologizing to us by email but we have never seen the coins or the money. It is our hard earned money, but I can’t just give up without trying another option. This is why I have to do this post.

**We have a minimum of 100BTC demanded every week in our target market.**

**We need support to sustain this market as getting bitcoin in our local market is not easy and we intend to make this our source of living. Jobs are not easy to find in my country and I preferred making a business for myself. You can help us in the following ways:**

i. Join our team and support us with bitcoin for a 10&amp;#37; stake. We pay you 10&amp;#37; of our profits monthly. This might require us to meet and set the terms. 

ii. Donate Bitcoin to us for us to have stock as we don’t really have any BCT now.

iii. Suggest an alternative on how we can get back to the market.

We can build this market together as it is virgin market. I greatly appreciate your support and looking forward to making our dreams come true.

After raising money from the sales of bitcoin, we will build an exchange for the market we are targeting. Anyone who can equally contribute in developing the exchange is welcome. 

Our market is sure as the demand is very high.

Thank you for taking your time to read. Please avoid insults as i mean what i am saying.

I need to get this BTC to this user soon, but I'm googling everything and I can't seem to find a solution. Coinbase will not let me transfer because of this hold. I also thought about buying another .05 worth and gifting it to the user, but I can't figure out if that is possible or not either. In a bind right now.

When should the block size limit be increased?,"The block size limit cannot continue to be 1MB forever. Here's why:

Assuming full SegWit adoption, Bitcoin's maximum throughput is about 8 transactions per second. The current population of the world is approximately 7.6 billion people. We can easily calculate the amount of time it would take for 7.6 billion people to do one on-chain transaction each:

7,600,000,000/8/60/60/24/365 = about 30 years.

That is literally the very best case scenario. It is wildly unrealistic in its optimism. Obviously people will continue doing on-chain transactions for all kinds of things for a long time to come, regardless of how successful the Lightning Network becomes.

So how do we decide that it's finally time to raise the block size limit? Have we fully given up on practical on-chain retail payments? What is the maximum fee that we're prepared to tolerate?",1528508413,09/06/2018 01:40:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ppgmh/when_should_the_block_size_limit_be_increased/,1

Why are there so few women in Bitcoin?," Unfortunately, when it comes to cryptocurrency… Women are a vast minority. Why this is the case is still debated, but the facts do not lie.

In your opinions, what are the reasons behind this? Is this something that should be changed, or is simply due to different drives and interests from the different genders?

Difficulty adjustment conceptual question,"I have been trying to the concept of difficulty adjustment, and I am running into some questions. I was hoping this could be the right place to solve them, and help me understand BTC better. (Please correct me if any of my concepts are incorrect, I am welcome to criticism)

So the difficulty is the number of 0s in the hash fx of nonce in the block. 
These number of 0s are adjusted by the algorithm based on hash power so that the block time can be around 10 mins.

The diff adjustment happens every 2016 blocks (abt 2 weeks). 
Now if the hash power suddenly has gone up (in the last hour or so) , and the difficulty hasnt been adjusted because maybe difficulty was adjusted 3 blocks back. Now the block getting mined can get mined in less than 10 mins, increasing the length of the bc with time. 

My question is: Why not have a difficulty adjustment every-block, or every two blocks?

What are the cons of having that?

New to Bitcoin Trading?," Hi. Please allow me to go back to basics. I just wanted to share to the  newcomers here in the crypto world that, in trading, you only have to  invest what you can afford to lose. Luck doesn't happen every time, so don't by hyped and spend all. I posted this on [Bitcointalk.org](https://Bitcointalk.org) and I'd like to share it here also.  


I knew that there are traders who  are more experienced than me, and I keep learning new things every day  and I don't consider myself an expert. I just really wanted to share what's on my mind. Lol.  


 Bitcoin, for me, is not  gambling. But your thoughts and actions are what you gamble. If you  don't want to lose, make yourself knowledgeable. Do further research on  how to get good profit. Knowing how to read a chart is one of the best  way I can offer. There are certain indication that can really help you  get good profits. Well, not everyone has the energy to learn that  practice, so I also suggest that you follow experts in this field. When I  was starting, I barely had an idea in crypto trading, I was like a new  student studying new culture. So I look for a sensei whether he knows it  or not, Lol. Choose someone you can really trust. Whether it's an  expert on your twitter or on facebook who likes sharing updates  regarding his views of the market. Or even a guy or gal on youtube. If  you can't read the chart let them read it for you.  


There you go,  these are some thoughts I have in mind. I'll try to share some tips  soon. I know that the awareness of Bitcoin to newcomers are increasing. I  was vulnerable in trading when I first try it, no knowledge, no  experience, no indicators, just gambling. I learned from all those  mistakes and sharing some tips can help newcomers not to experience the  same thing. But as what wise men say, ""Experience is the best teacher.""  Good luck, folks!  


What do you think? You can share yours too.",1528556750,09/06/2018 15:05:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ptdaz/new_to_bitcoin_trading/,1
I want to get into bitcoin mining. How do I start?,"Hey everyone! Just like the title says, I want to get into bitcoin mining but I have no experience whatsoever. I was thinking of getting some ant miners once the next semester starts since I won't be paying for electricity at my apartment but right now I'd probably just be using my (crappy but lovable) custom build PC to mine. Can someone guide me through the process? What software do I need? How does mining actually work? Are there any good tutorials that really helped you all out when you started?

Also, I wanted to purchase $100 worth of bitcoin just to get started. How would I go about doing that and when would the right time to buy be?",1528557315,09/06/2018 15:15:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ptfoh/i_want_to_get_into_bitcoin_mining_how_do_i_start/,1

PayPal - A Problem Solved by Bitcoin,"A crooked merchant (Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante) sold me a subscription to his Bitcoin Newsletter. IMO it was an incomprehensible rag not worth any $$. When he flopped and became a full time shill for BCASH I canceled the subscription. Some 6 months later he hits me with a charge for about $60.00 for no reason. I did not authorize the charge so I disputed it through PayPal. The dispute was resolved in favor of the merchant, despite the PROOF I provided that the charge was not valid.

If the subscription had originally been with Bitcoin there would be no way for The Dollar Vigilante or PayPal to TAKE the money without my authorization. Lesson learned.

The cap of 21 million coins,"Changing this would be a profound event in bitcoins history if it were to ever happen.

My thoughts are that just like the fear around the Y2K bug in 2000, we will reach a similar fear in 2140 when the block reward ceases causing people to make irrational decisions.

There may be propoganda and lobbying to convince people that it would be a good idea to increase the supply.

Lets look at history. How many times has consensus lead to abandonning the gold standard. Zero, it was always a sly roundabout dictated decision made by those in power like the ""Nixon Shock"" in 1971 removing the dollar from gold. Consensus would never agree to this and miners are not the only constituents of consensus, everyone has a say by voting with their money.

If this change were ever to be implemented as a hard fork the chain would obviously split. That would leave the inflationary chain to compete with the supply capped chain. In this environment everyone would have the same number of coins on both chains and the inflationary chain would naturally lose value aginst the supply capped chain. Users would choose the chain that holds its value better and miners will choose the chain that the users choose to ensure they earn more in transaction fees. 

This is of course only true if average users use the main chain. If we have a main chain that is only used by ""5000 central banks"" as a settlement layer as Saifedean Ammous puts it because fees are too high for average users, then those central banks could migrate to the new inflationary chain leaving the supply capped chain with no use making it trivial to keep miners chasing profit on the new inflationary chain rendering the supply capped chain useless.

How does lightning network split between 2 chains? Obviously the lightning hubs choose which chain the user end up on, correct?

Someone explain to me how it is impossible to increase the 21 million cap once lightning hubs dictate which future chain ends up with all the users.

Their debit cards can still be used, but the last time I looked, no exchanges accepted debit cards.

How does rockit coin ATM’s follow the market?,"I recently bought some coin from an ATM rockit coin. And I noticed the prices are hundreds of dollars off from current exchange rates. After trying to ask the Rockit coin support reps they never really answered my question nor was I able to find a solid explanation on their site for how they adjust with the market prices or how far off they are from the live trading market. Can someone explain how it works if you have bought coin from one before? 

I assume they are behind... and if so you could potentially get coin cheaper if you wait. But I’m not sure. Something tells me it isn’t a feasible or the best way to acquire coin if the prices are always higher.

""Only a few clicks in, however, a few other changes emerge. Weathered and tested ecosystem businesses such as Coinbase, Blockchain.com, and Bitpay aren’t even alluded to.

&gt; ***@olivierjanss*** *: ""Bitcoin.org just removed/censored the 2 largest US Bitcoin companies (@BitPay and @coinbase). It's a good move: Bitcoin Core is obviously no longer Bitcoin, and should ideally be removed from both @BitPay and @coinbase too.""

Quick question regarding reversing 0 conf transactions,"Hi guys. So I’ve noticed exchanges and vendors online who accept btc typically ensure the transactions hit a certain amount of confirmations before it’s deemed valid. The confirmation amount seem to vary and I’m aware that it’s dependent on the person or business.

What I want to know is why 0 confirmation transactions are frowned upon? Every transaction I’ve processed of course always starts at 0 condos and eventually starts confirming.  And from what I’ve noticed, there’s no actual way to reverse or cancel the transaction even at 0 confs.

So why the requirement for multiple confirmations when even at just  0 confs you know the transaction is going to go through eventually anyway? My only assumption is speed. You pay a higher fee, tx’s are faster, and the vendor gets their btc much faster instead of it sitting on the queue for however long. Just an assumption.

Thanks for your time guys.

Please help with extracting (very old) Schildbach wallet.,"I'll start by saying I've gone through all the guides I could find, and even tried the workarounds for the various 'gotchas' but still no luck.

On this guide:

[https://github.com/bitcoin\-wallet/bitcoin\-wallet/blob/master/wallet/README.recover.md](https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/README.recover.md)

it says to do this:

openssl enc \-d \-aes\-256\-cbc \-md md5 \-a \-in bitcoin\-wallet\-backup\-testnet\-2014\-11\-01 \&gt; bitcoin\-wallet\-decrypted\-backup

Then:  
\&gt;  If it prints ""bad password"" you've got the wrong password

Mine actually printed ""bad decrypt""... so then there's this hint from stackexchange ([https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/17176/how\-to\-decode\-private\-key\-from\-android\-bitcoin\-wallet](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/17176/how-to-decode-private-key-from-android-bitcoin-wallet)):

\&gt; If anyone is trying this in 2017, openssl has now defaulted to use SHA256 instead of the MD5 assumed in the older answers. Add ""\-md md5"" (no quotes) to your openssl command line string.

He says that before adding ""\-md md5"" you might get ""bad decrypt"" and then adding it solves it. Problem is that I AM adding \-md md5 but \*still\* get the ""bad decrypt"" message.

openssl enc \-d \-aes\-256\-cbc \-md md5 \-a \-in bitcoin\-wallet\-backup\-2018\-04\-18 \&gt; decrypted\-wallet\-backup2

Just posting the updated number for this week.

https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VEF/BTC

See my older posts to see the full context, any question AMA.

I just want to explain something I saw in older posts, some people say that the exchange rate is around 80,000 Bs. per USD. That is the fixed rate SET by the government, no one sells at that rate, only the government does and it's limited, they sell only around 1millon USD each two weeks which of course is NOT enough to supply the country demand.

So there is a black market / street market that works with supply and demand. Anyway, if we use the exchange rate set by the government minimum wage would be around 32 USD per month (2,550,000 / 80,000)

One kilo of meat is around 5,000,000 Bs. so using street rate that is around 2 USD using government fixed rate that is 62.5 USD, which one makes more sense?",1528636042,10/06/2018 13:07:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8q0o8s/6932309904123_bolivares_were_traded_in/,1

[Help!] Transfer funds without syncing Bitcoin Core,"Hello guys,

Here is what happened. I have done a small freelancing work, and the guy asked whether to pay in Bitcoins. Having never owned Bitcoins, I said YES.

I quickly fired up to [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) and there I was asked to choose a wallet. Selected the first entry in the list of things, which is [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) ,downloaded and installed. 

I then created an address to receive funds, and sent it across. Which I was confirmed that  went successfully.

[https://blockchain.info/address/39UM5DMztcEmP2RoBiHJfArhuVuSv3Ndcj](https://blockchain.info/address/39UM5DMztcEmP2RoBiHJfArhuVuSv3Ndcj)

Then I switched back to Bitcoin Core, to check if the transaction really went through; here I am seeing it is downloading a HUGE set of files. Having only a capped amount of data, I quickly disabled syncing. 150GB is a half a year worth of data for me.

To obtain the funds without syncing, I have tried few things with no luck yet;

* Transferring private key to blockchain.info (Import succeeds but 0.0 balance)
* Transferring private key to Electrum using import sweep (Gives error  ""No inputs found. (Note that inputs need to be confirmed"" ) )
* Making a transaction to another account using command line. (I have used [this](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002990903-How-can-I-recover-funds-from-a-Bitcoin-Core-wallet-dat-file-without-having-the-entire-blockchain-downloaded-) article, but unable to broadcast the transaction. Most probably due to my address being multi signature wallet. )

Is there anyone who can point me in the right direction?

Thanks.",1528643950,10/06/2018 15:19:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8q1gcy/help_transfer_funds_without_syncing_bitcoin_core/,1

The idea came after hearing much discussions about the price of Bitcoin around the offices and thought we'd turn it into a mini game/app that is also useful. More people joining in and trying their hand at predicting the price may lead more of them to learn about cryptocurrency, it's foundation and spread cryptocurrencies even further which is what we found in the past as we've also built a market simulation app that was quiet popular so we wanted to also release BitPredict to the public.

**Few things to note:**

* Currently there are four ""pools"" and only Bitcoin is supported. 
* Each day 10 winners are picked from each pool.
* One prediction is allowed per pool, per day.
* Predictions close at 10:00 PM UTC
* Winners are picked at 11:59 PM UTC based on the close price(11:59UTC) gathered from 21 popular exchanges, winners are picked based on who's prediction is closest to the close price. Multiplier sets in after pool total is calculated. After that predictions open for the next day.
* *BitPredict erases all prediction data permanently after winners are picked so nothing is retained, except the total won value.*
* You can try the app without signing up.
* We've tested the app as much as we could but we're sure now that its live we will find a whole stuff that needs tweaking and fixing, so your feedback will be invaluable.
* There are multiple things that we are planning to add, daily close price list, some charts and maybe even an live feed of the predictions, but we'll see how it scales.  
* The app is free and offers initial in\-app cash which you can use to place a bet on the close price right now.
* The app will be supported by in app purchases from those who want to jump straight to the more advanced pools or want extra in\-app cash.

I'm not sure if it's something you will enjoy, love or hate as we've been testing it inside and have not looked out for any opinions or feedback as we found it fun ourselves. So here it is in raw form. As a long term investor it's been quiet a while since i got to check the daily price with the feeling of excitement, this simulates that a bit, and the competitive side in me want's to make the closest prediction everyday so leaderboards should be coming up soon. If it sounds like you would like it, give it a go. And your feedback is very welcome.

Shopping around fora Forum to shop around for Cashout Site,"Bitcoin Adventurers,

I invested in a bitcoin a couple of years back and the price is considerably up from the point that I got in.  I need to buy a car now so it makes sense to cash out about a third of my holdings.

I understand that I'm probably not allowed to ask for a recommendation for a cashout site on this particular board, so I guess I'll ask instead the question, where am I allowed to ask this question?

I've already tried Coinbase (unhelpful), Coinpayments (doesn't actually cashout), and OKCoin (my country is not supported) so I'm open to reputable alternatives.

If you were me and wanted to get some advice on this, to what forum would you turn?  Thanks!",1528656730,10/06/2018 18:52:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8q2xis/shopping_around_fora_forum_to_shop_around_for/,1

I am part of a project to bring the first crypto manga to the world!,"The manga is called Shonen Crypto, it  was created to bring crypto entertainment in the manga format to the general public! It contains all crypto related comedy, action, education and events! Currently feauring Bitcoin MAN, Bitcoin Senpai, Crypto-kun and more!

I know translations could be better, it was my first time translating, the next release will be much better. 

I began as a fan who became inspired by their work. I'm pretty enthusiastic about bringing this to an English format! 

Bitcoin.com just did an article on Shonen Crypto! So that's what got me so stoked to post to Reddit about it!

Niffler - A startup focused on teaching newbies about Bitcoin.,"Do you remember the first time you became interested in Bitcoin and why?  Most of us got involved based on the financial notion that we could make some money as early adopters. The financial reward side of Bitcoin is still the number one reason most people interested in Bitcoin get involved today and it continues to be the number one reason for most people to gain deeper knowledge about Bitcoin and technology behind it. 

At Niffler we aim to use the financial reward motivation behind Bitcoin and Bitcoin trading to get people curious and thus increase the adoption. Our platform allows simulated trading without using real money to help people get more comfortable with trading crypto while also experiencing the day to day volatility of the market without the risk of losing their shirt. Niffler aims to go beyond just this by also showcasing to our users the many hazards that also exist in the space. For e.g. No exchange will ever tell you that it's bad practice to keep crypto stored on the exchange (naturally it's against their self\-interest) or the very unexpected ways you can be scammed by receiving pre\-setup hard wallets.... just to name a couple hazards.  

Our platform is truly unique in what we do as we allow experienced crypto traders and hodlers the ability to teach newbies by sharing their own trading actions on the same platform. Once you, as an experienced trader can show the community that you made enough profit from your trades, you can then start building your own patron style following that pays you a set subscription fee (set by you) to follow all of your future activity and trades on the platform. Think of Niffler as Patreon, meets Coinbase without the risk for newbies while providing numerous rewards for experienced traders helping them. 

At the end of the day, we hope that newbies will leave our platform knowing more about Bitcoin and the technology behind it as well as being better prepared to enter wild west of cryptocurrencies and crypto trading. Some of them might go on to become educated and steadfast day traders and some of them might become experienced long\-term hodlers, or simply, some may just become educated supporters and adopters of Bitcoin and its game\-changing technology and applications outside of trading.

Our platform is currently being tested locally... however, for early beta access you can pre\-register on [https://niffler.co](https://niffler.co)",1528671132,10/06/2018 22:52:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8q4mgh/niffler_a_startup_focused_on_teaching_newbies/,1

Good part, more money are in the industry. 
Bad part, only the rich know when to short and when to long. 

The solution for crypto at this moment is to become stable. Stability is  achieved via more money being put in. This will happen and will happen indeed, just a matter of time.

"After 2 days of tinkering and trial and error, I finally got my lightning network node running on MAINNET and bought some stickers!","[https://imgur.com/a/h0s1p40](https://imgur.com/a/h0s1p40)?

As a bit of background: I'm far from technically illiterate, but I'd never used linux before or really done anything in the terminal. Most of the time taken was waiting for block confirmations, and also finding that the blockstream store is very poorly connected on the lightning network so I was struggling to find a route for the payment. After a bit of digging I found the node ID for blockstream directly and opened a payment channel with them so that I was able to buy their stickers!

I'm going to expand the number of payment channels I have open over the next few days to some of the most well\-connected nodes on the network, which will hopefully make it slightly easier for others to get their payments routed to blockstream when trying to buy the stickers, as I tried 5!!!! very well connected nodes and through none of them could I get a route. Hopefully this is somewhere I can help out \- that's why we're running nodes right?!

OBVIOUS DISCLAIMER: Lightning is supposed to be run on testnet \- DONT put in any funds you aren't prepared to lose in case there's a bug or security flaw!

After learning a LOT through this process I'm happy to give others a hand with setting up their own lightning nodes if wanted, or answer any questions! :)",1528676008,11/06/2018 00:13:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8q55c8/after_2_days_of_tinkering_and_trial_and_error_i/,1

HODLer holding no more - This time it really looks different,"Long time hodler here. Won't post my wallet address and I'm also using a throaway account for privacy reasons, but click on the following imgur link https://imgur.com/a/I0NOJo1  and you can see on the screenshot I took when I started hodling. Back when MultiBit wasn't even MultiBit HD and Peercoin was still a thing.

Alas, with the drop in price, this week I'm giving up on Bitcoin. Maybe not forever, but at least for one year or two, only coming back in case things change.

Here's my reasoning, I post it here in the hopes someone can prove me wrong. As they say on /r/UFO, ""I want to believe"".

Reason #1 - This time adoption is actually falling

Back in the day, Microsoft started accepting BTC. Then Expedia, Steam... Now they are all bailing out. People will tell me about lightning, what brings us to...

Reason #2 - This time the tech is not going forward.

Don't get me wrong, I know that in theory (and even in testnet) Lightning seems to work perfectly but that's not where my bitcoins are. My bitcoins are on mainnet, a place where devolpment has stalled, objectively speaking. Segwit adoption hasn't even broken 50% and the most known wallets are not using it (BRD, which used to be called bread wallet, blockchain.info, etc.) and lightning is far more complex than segwit. The programming of watch towers alone for Christ sake, is more complex than implementing segwit 5 times over.

Reason #3 - There are no newbies left to be converted.

Back in 2013, even if the price fell 90%, it didn't matter much. Because most people hadn't heard about it. Now, everyone and their uncle are aware that bitcoin exists and that it went all the way up to $20,000 and now it's down to $6,500. It is far easier to convince someone who does not know anything about bitcoin to use it than it is to convince someone who lost 60% of what they invested in this ""internet money"" to come back and give it another chance. If you ever find yourself divorced, would you rather find a new girl or go back to your ex, whom you can't even think about without feeling a sour taste in your tongue?

Reason #4 - The competition will be hard to beat.

Back in 2012, you could tell your friends about this ""magical"" thing that was sending someone money over the internet, with the click of a button. Now we have apple pay and NFC. Even with Lightning, I find it hard to believe that bitcoin will ever be less cumbersome than the methods of payment we have now.

Reason #5 - Even if the price goes back up, the network is still broken.

I hate to side with Bcash supporters but the truth is Bitcoin ""classic"", BTC, is still now ready to be used by everybody. Even if, by some unkown reason, we get everyone we had in December '17 back and the price goes all the way up to $20,000, fees will be the same they were back then. It's still taboo to talk about a reasonable block size increase. Do you remember when it cost $20 to send a transaction? That's still the case if bitcoin gains adoption. I mean, we may get it down to $16 with batching and 37% of the wallets using Segwit but the problem is NOT solved and lightning as a fix is at least 5 years away.

Reason #6 - The speculation money is all on ICOs.

If we have no widespread adoption we have to rely on speculators to drive prices up. Back in 2013 we had them on board. Now they're gone, there is no easy money to be made in BTC. And there will never be a CryptoKitties that will make you rich overnight. Bitcoin is just too old to be a talented child that can join the Jackson Five and still to young to play with KISS. It's a teenager that is too embarassed to go to school with mom but too young to drive.

Reason #7 - We can't buy and can't mine anymore

In theory we can, of course. But I still remember 2013 when I bought one whole bitcoin every month, with what was left from my salary. Now I can't even buy 0,1 BTC with the same money. And I can't mine either. Back than if you didn't have any money you could get BTC that way. Now... It's too expensive to be bought and too cheap to be sold. Maybe that's why we call ourselves HODLERS. Holding is all one can do now.

Reason #8 - It's not ""my club"" anymore

From time to time I still check Satoshi's profile on bitcointalk.org. And Gavin Andresen's blog. And Mike Hearn's. Now they're gone. One can't help but feel old. I know this is not a logical reason to give up on bitcoin but still... I feel like the guy who's still trying to hook up with the cheerleader from high school while all of my friends have moved on...

I know it's an old cliché. But this time, the same ol' ""death of bitcoin"" babbling really sounds different.",1528680862,11/06/2018 01:34:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8q5nan/hodler_holding_no_more_this_time_it_really_looks/,1

ELI5 - how is mining BTC still profitable?,"Is it still profitable to mine at prices \&lt;7k? 

Apparently it is, but what is the margin? With hash rate constantly increasing by \&gt;15&amp;#37; on average each month over the past year, my napkin calculation tells me an Antminer 9 for example would barely break even in \~18 months, give or take, depending on energy costs etc. So what's the trick here? Top secret 7nm mining gear? Free / cheap energy? Or just miners with deep pockets sitting it out, i.e. betting on the next price recovery with a new ATH?

HODLer holding no more - This time it really looks different,"Long time hodler here. Won't post my wallet address but click on the imgur link and you can see on the screenshot I took when I started hodling. Back when MultiBit wasn't even MultiBit HD and Peercoin was still a thing.

Alas, with the drop in price, this week I'm giving up on Bitcoin. Maybe not forever, but for an year or two, in case things change.

Here's my reasoning, I post it here in the hopes someone can prove me wrong. As they say on r/UFO, ""I want to believe""

Reason #1 - This time adoption is actually falling

Back in the day, Microsoft started accepting BTC. Then Expedia, Steam... Now they are all bailing out. People will tell me about lightning, what brings us to...

Reason #2 - This time the tech is not going forward.

Don't get me wrong, I know that in theory (and even in testnet) Lightning seems to work perfectly but that's not where my bitcoins are. My bitcoins are on mainnet, a place where devolpment has stalled, objectively speaking. Segwit adoption hasn't even broken 50% and the most known wallets are not using it (BRD, which used to be called bread wallet, blockchain.info, etc.) and lightning is far more complex than segwit. The programming of watch towers alone for Christ sake, is more complex than implementing segwit 5 times over.

Reason #3 - There are no newbies left to be converted.

Back in 2013, even if the price fell 90%, it didn't matter much. Because most people hadn't heard about it. Now, everyone and their uncle are aware that bitcoin exists and that it went all the way up to $20,000 and now it's down to $6,500. It is far easier to convince someone who does not know anything about bitcoin to use it than it is to convince someone who lost 60% of what they invested in this ""internet money"" to come back and give it another chance. If you ever find yourself divorced, would you rather find a new girl or go back to your ex, whom you can't even think about without feeling a sour taste in your tongue?

Reason #4 - The competition will be hard to beat.

Back in 2012, you could tell your friends about this ""magical"" thing that was sending someone money over the internet, with the click of a button. Now we have apple pay and NFC. Even with Lightning, I find it hard to believe that bitcoin will ever be less cumbersome than the methods of payment we have now.

Reason #5 - Even if the price goes back up, the network is still broken.

I hate to side with Bcash supporters but the truth is Bitcoin ""classic"", BTC, is still now ready to be used by everybody. Even if, by some unkown reason, we get everyone we had in December '17 back and the price goes all the way up to $20,000, fees will be the same they were back then. It's still taboo to talk about a reasonable block size increase. Do you remember when it cost $20 to send a transaction? That's still the case if bitcoin gains adoption. I mean, we may get it down to $16 with batching and 37% of the wallets using Segwit but the problem is NOT solved and lightning as a fix is at least 5 years away.

Reason #6 - The speculation money is all on ICOs.

If we have no widespread adoption we have to rely on speculators to drive prices up. Back in 2013 we had them on board. Now they're gone, there is no easy money to be made in BTC. And there will never be a CryptoKitties that will make you rich overnight. Bitcoin is just too old to be a talented child that can join the Jackson Five and still to young to play with KISS. It's a teenager that is too embarassed to go to school with mom but too young to drive.

Reason #7 - We can't buy and can't mine anymore

In theory we can, of course. But I still remember 2013 when I bought one whole bitcoin every month, with what was left from my salary. Now I can't even buy 0,1 BTC with the same money. And I can't mine either. Back than if you didn't have any money you could get BTC that way. Now... It's too expensive to be bought and too cheap to be sold. Maybe that's why we call ourselves HODLERS. Holding is all one can do now.

Reason #8 - It's not ""my club"" anymore

From time to time I still check Satoshi's profile on bitcointalk.org. And Gavin Andresen's blog. And Mike Hearn's. Now they're gone. One can't help but feel old. I know this is not a logical reason to give up on bitcoin but still... I feel like the guy who's still trying to hook up with the cheerleader from high school while all of my friends have moved on...

I know it's an old cliché. But this time, it really looks different.",1528720506,11/06/2018 12:35:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8q96gk/hodler_holding_no_more_this_time_it_really_looks/,1

Lightning Network enabled bitcoin wallet UX design,"I think that most people won't want to bother with knowing about LN at all, so I think a user\-minded phone wallet which is LN enabled should just have lightning network enabled and on sort of ""auto\-pilot"" setting up and closing channels without the users content for each action, and rather have an advanced mode where you set up and close channels etc. And in the end you just show how much bitcoin you have in your wallet and a button to send and one to receive.

In the background the app would calculate if it makes sense to make a transaction on chain or off chain depending on the size, and try to do calculations and be as cost efficient as possible when it comes to choosing routes and setting up channels.

I think this level of sophistication in a wallet is what is needed for regular people to use bitcoin. You can't expect people to get into how channels work and what the blockchain is and dadada, both because it's too complicated, and because they don't care. Most people don't care how money or VISA works, but they know they can buy a croissant if they swipe it and enter their PIN and the rest is magic and that's OK.",1528731782,11/06/2018 15:43:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qaj87/lightning_network_enabled_bitcoin_wallet_ux_design/,1

"Looking back on market activity post-hack news, I've come to the realization that whales sold more btc than was actually stolen. By many fold.","Looks like approx 4k btc was sold on bitfinex *alone*, which is more than what was actually stolen. If you calculate all the other liquid marketplaces, then you have amounts many fold greater than what was stolen.

I think this is a good example of whales trying to play the market. The only reason there was a drop in price, is because someone with thousands of btc (or several actors) decided in unison to tank the market by either selling, or short selling, to pre-emptively *start* the panic, which would allow them to buy back cheaper after the panic had run its course.

However, it appears the attempt failed. Beyond the first hour, there has been nothing but sideways activity. The panic that these whales thought would happen did not happen.

Hopefully they were shorts and that 4k+ btc will need to be bought back once people realize there was no panic.

This was a very small hack, of a no name exchange. It only highlights the contrast between bitcoin the system, and the centralized actors that act as fiat gateways in the ecosystem.

These centralized actors are always going to be vulnerable, and it was enormously stupid of them to allow 30% of their assets to be liquid on a hot wallet. More seasoned veterns (like bitstamp) have been hacked in the past, but only ended up losing a maximum of 5% of their assets due to conservative cold wallet practices.

How can any exchange responsibly allow more than 5% of their assets to exist on a hot wallet? I think the obvious answer is that if an exchange allows for greater than 5% of its assets on a hot wallet, then that exchange deserves to be hacked, and its leadership nullified.

This is no different than a banking institution over-leveraging on risky assets, making poor decisions, and then losing the entire business when the bet goes south.

These exchanges need to be eliminated from the ecosystem. Look at what it has caused. Short term damage, yes, but still damage that did not need to happen. These centralized agencies *weaken* the entire ecosystem with their poor security and irresponsible capital allocation decisions.

https://www.moonmath.win

## Weekend Price action

After this last weekend some of you are probably still wondering if I'm stuck on
stability. Have I caught up with the times? Am I going to make things right? Am
I changing my position?

Let's work through it together by stepping back and taking a look at what might
have changed in our projections since acquiring these new data over the weekend.


## The Rearview Mirror

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TK2OHx1E/

I'm marking periods of observed distribution with green blocks and periods of
accumulation with a blue box. We haven't known it when in periods of
accumulation in the past and I don't think it's possible to know when you are.
Sometimes people guess and they get it right. If anybody can do that consistently
then they can write a best-selling book on trading and end market instability
forever.

The same is true for distribution. You can only observe the market in hindsight.
So, looking at the market in these terms is extremely limited if you're trying to
make projections or understand where we might be headed.

Before the weekend I thought we were in a period of accumulation. I was wrong.

You'll also notice that I moved around where we are on the daily projection.
Today, the green projection matches up with February 18th, 2012. The red
projection matches up with April 14th, 2015. 

## Changing Projections

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BzyI540p/

I changed the projections so the matched up with market bottoms that were near
stable periods instead of matching up periods based on the beginning of a periods
that had high stability and low RSI. The dates are close to the same, but we get
nice market bottoms to match up with our current chart.

## Shifting Perspective?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JcJkZEWX/

Looking for an opportunity to shift my perspective and I'm seeing some. I had
been optimistic that a period of low volatility had shot off like a rocket, and
that, maybe, we'd see bullish recovery by the end of the summer. I'm less
convinced of that now. In fact, I'm looking at this chart and wondering if we're
going to go sideways through the end of the year. Attempting a new ATH in 2018
is probably off the table unless there's a barrage of good news that flips the
market into overdrive.

## Distribution and Accumulation

https://www.tradingview.com/x/k07ayBzr/

I've been going on about the debate between distribution and accumulation.
They're effectively two sides of the coin that the market is slipping between
all the time? What's the motivation of buyers and sellers? You can't really
know, but there are some indicators we can use that help us guess at that
broadly.

## LocalBitcoins Volume

https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html

Transaction volume looks incredible overall, but we're not seeing growth in
North American or Central/South Asia.

* https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/north-america.html
* https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/central-south-asia.html
* https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/asia-pacific.html

Transaction volume growth is coming from Europe and Latin America; places that
have distressed currencies and ubiquitous access to (mostly) stable networks.

* https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/latin-america.html
* https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/europe.html

We're not seeing a rapid influx of capital anywhere, but if you compare actual
Bitcoin adoption in places that are using it, presumably for Bitcoin's
intended purpose, then I think you start to see an emerging pattern.

## Irrational Exuberance

There's growing irrational exuberance among bears illustrated by market
descriptions of diverse use cases for Blockchain technology. It's as though the
discovery of a new application of the underlying technology is automatically a
candidate for a new paradigm in human experience. This is analogous to what we
saw around Internet startups in 1995 - 2000. After exposing the market to nearly 1.8
trillion USD in lost value it took two and a half years to find a market bottom.
The scale of Bitcoin is very different, but I think it's possible that if alts
don't shake out in this market then we're headed for something much worse on a
much larger scale.

Actual--real world--Blockchain usage is low while acquisition of cryptocurrencies
for speculation is very high. Acquisition for speculation pushes
mining infrastructure along; as we've seen. infrastructure isn't fake; it's very
real. You can't fake a miner and you can't fake the electricity it's using
unless you're stealing it. That economy has grown up and it will keep growing
through this market, despite and because of what speculators fail to see:
fundamental real world usage.

Transactions are going up, dollars are going down. You don't see things like
LocalBitcoins popping up for alts because the alt market, and ICOs, are entirely composed of
a group of speculators who have lost their collective minds. Thinking that Bitcoin usage in
coffee shops implies is simply not appealing metric. I don't want to mess around
in a project where the end game is a Venti-Mocha-Frappachino at Starbucks.

## An Alternative to Corruption 

Bitcoin isn't here for adoption on Wall Street. It isn't a technology that makes
sharing information easier. It isn't something that's meant to overthrow Uber
or create a new sharing economy. There isn't some killer application for
blockchain that's going to change the economics of how software applications are
developed.

Bitcoin protects people who are forced to suffer under systems where power,
corruption, and incompetence control the value of money. Any other application
for a blockchain I've seen isn't as significant and it doesn't qualify as part
of the revolution that Bitcoin already is.

Good hunting.

Separately, the Russian Ministry of Finance plans to introduce a law that will criminalize the use of cryptocurrencies as money substitutes.Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia, said she and the Russian Finance Ministry oppose the use of virtual currencies ""as private money and money surrogates,” saying only the ruble can be used to pay for goods and services, Bitcoin.com reported. ""There is the ruble, and everything else is a surrogate,"" she said. Nabiullina said the move to criminalize the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies as money substitutes is to protect the Russian ruble. ""This is necessary to protect the ruble as the single legal \[means of\] payment in Russia,"" she said.

This kind of puzzles me. I was under the impression that the US classified Bitcoin as a “digital asset” which is why we have to pay capital gains tax on it. That being said, as an “asset” and not a “currency” or “security”, why would selling BTC, or any other Cryptocurrency that is considered a currency or security, in person be any different than selling anything on Craigslist? Nobody registers with anyone to sell something on Craigslist except for Craigslist, and that’s only if you want. Truthfully, if you sell as a guest basically, you only need an email to confirm your link and publish it. You don’t even have to create a username or password. I may have missed something somewhere on the political side, but if that’s the case please inform me, and if not, can anyone give a solid answer to my question?

It's funny how weak hands show up in droves whenever Bitcoin's price is low...,"...to tell everyone how blockchain technology is done and the market is officially over. lol

More accurately, they tend to show up when the price is *relatively low*, since weak hands usually buy at the very top and then come here to complain about the price being too low for them to buy 6 months later... but if you actually zoom out on the chart, you'll see that Bitcoin is worth *much* more today than it was exactly 1 year ago. In fact, many long term investors are still well into the green and don't share the same doom &amp; gloom sentiment as weak hands do, as they've seen this show many times before.

Not only is this market still in its infancy stages, but with the constant evolution of blockchain technology, decentralized apps and exchanges, looming approval of security tokens, a potential BTC-backed exhange traded fund in the works... and yes, even sensible regulation on the horizon... the future of blockchain technology is poised to stick around not just for the rest of our lives, but many years into the future.

Those who can't see it today are the same type of shortsighted individuals who only focused on the day-to-day price back in 2014, 2015, and hell, even parts of 2017. They are akin to those who said the video game industry was dead back in the 80s, the internet would only be used by geeks in the 90s, and Apple iPhones would never catch on in the 00s. 

Yes, these are now the ""Bitcoin is dead..."" people of the 2010s.

We're looking for an experienced, dedicated and motivated ICO researcher/investor that will find us upcoming projects, so we can analyse the team and the whitepaper and look if we have connections within that project. If there's enough demand within the team we can try to negotiate a deal for the private presale. 

You must be 18\+, have a (very) good knowledge of the English language, have at least 5 months experience in crypto and ICOs (if not, convince me why you're still suitable for the job), be able to have meetings multiple times a week (online). We prefer someone with experience in investing in stocks/real estate and/or with a business/computer science/IT education. Your benefit lies in the fact that you'll build up international connections and will be able to participate in the early stages of ICOs, rather than attending public token sales.

If you're interested, send me a PM and let me know who you are and what your past ICOs are for example, so we can get to know each other and find out if there's a match. Thank you for reading.

Here's what 'Institutional Investors' are waiting for:,"I just had the most enlightening conversation with one of my clients and I want to share the key ideas with you here.

This person is a technologist who is working for a major financial services firm that is developing some tools and infrastructure for BTC trading. We were casually discussing the price fluctuations over the last few days and this person explained the viewpoint of this particular institutions management with me (they didn't name the firm, so I can't offer any clues \- feel free to speculate).

Here's what was outlined to me:

* The major financial services institutions know that BTC prices are driven by trading, not holding or spending (not 'utility', in the common sense of the term) and they therefore view it like gold (an arbitrary value store).
* They believe that BTC will have a market value based on the wealth that they (and their clients) choose to give it, just like they do with gold.
* They know that the 'asset' they are concerned with is actually the ecosystem that sustains the network, not the BTC directly.
* These institutions view the 'floor' for the BTC price as the 'minimum exchange value required to sustain the network'.
* They therefore view the health of the network (number of participants and aggregate hashrate) as the relevant indicator for establishing the price floor: when the exchange value drops to the point where the health of the network begins to show signs of weakness then they will be satisfied that they are buying in at the right price.
* These same institutional investors are not in a hurry to see price appreciation. Their primary concern is share of control.
* They will buy slowly \- inconspicuously \- to keep the price from appreciating while they build their stakes (usual tricks of multiple wallets, obfuscating with occasional sells).
* At some point the markets will cotton on to the game and the late\-comers will rush to grab what share of the BTC supply remains to be traded. It could be six months, a year, two years, whatever. They are not in a rush.
* They will use those BTC as collateral (just like gold) for low\-cost borrowing of fiat for expansion and payouts to customers.

This person's advice to me was simple: watch the price fall until the network starts to show signs of 'weakening'. When this happens, expect a period of price stabilization: low volume trading within a narrowing price range, with minor upward movement in the price trend as required to keep the miners (and their vendors) healthy and the ecosystem growing. It seemed pretty clear that retail use of BTC for payments wasn't on the radar, and the biggest threat they see is from central banks that are in the process of doing the very same thing for the same reason.

Note that this is not advice, nor evidence of anything and I don't know any more than I am sharing here, although I would be pleased to see a debate and discussion. It made a lot of sense to me and I thought some of you might agree.",1528770402,12/06/2018 02:26:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qfbwd/heres_what_institutional_investors_are_waiting_for/,1

It's a concept we are already used to in Bitcoin, and nobody thinks they aren't Bitcoins anymore when you move them to a hot wallet from cold storage or something.

It costs just $68 to cover the entire canvas at satoshis.place. Post your suggestions below.,"[Satoshis.Place](https://Satoshis.Place) is a public canvas that can be painted by anyone. Similar to reddit place except it cost 1 satoshi per pixel (paid over lightning network). There are 1 million pixels available so the cost to cover the entire thing would be about $68. 

If there is enough interest I will paint the whole canvas with a suitable image. 

Some ideas:

\- An r/bitcoin logo 

\- An ad for a worthy fundraiser or charity.

\- QR code for worthy bitcoin donations (i.e. Andreas Antonopoulos). 

\- A message to other crypto communities. 

Keep it simple and PG. I will try to do the background with a bot but the image itself I may need to do by hand (unless someone can write me a nice bot that will do complex images).

Bitcoin is like an authentic gold sprint: it’s the miners who are subjugated,"**Bitcoin is treated like gold**. While this is not reassuring to those who have lost their coins it does offer a fruitful analogy to help us understand Bitcoin mining. Bitcoins are creating trust through smart contracts and online reputation systems and allowing donors to see where their donations go through a secure and transparent ledger. Bitcoin may not be raising everyday as its value is slightly decreased from where it started but it is still a very good investment plan.  There are many websites which tell you how to trade bitcoins but one should be wary of scamster websites which dupe unexpecting businessmen.

Lightning node with proxy,"I'm thinking about starting a light node, but what prevented me to do it so far is the risk of having a hot wallet on a server. So I was thinking if any of the node implementations supports having a proxy, which would work as follows.

I would buy a cheap server with external IP version 4 address. This IP address is advertised as my node's IP address and anyone can connect to it. However the real server and lightning node I run elsewhere behind NAT. This second machine is not used for anything else and does not run any services that can be accessed from the Internet. It's IP address would not be known to any node except for those nodes that my node will create outbound connections to.

This second node would connect to the proxy server which would then be able to redirect all incoming connections to the external IP address to it.

With this setup I would be very confident that my funds are secure and the same time I would allow incoming connections.

Is any of the lightning node implementations compatible with such a setup or even support it directly?",1528793093,12/06/2018 08:44:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qhdx4/lightning_node_with_proxy/,1

How bitcoin beats GDPR and online poker restriction in EU.,"Tried to play poker online after few years back but countries across the europe forced legal registration on major poker/casino sites. You have to send credit card details, scan of ID (sometimes 2 or even a passport), after that you have to go physically to bureau to do additional paperwork and after that you are allowed to deposit from bank account to the pokersite (pokerstars and many more) and of course they will track you that you payed taxes after that, so they can do more strict legislation to have more bureaus... I tried to find other sites which doesnt require any sort of these and i found some. You can deposit via credit card after registration (just name and street address, no further requirements or confirmation - no check), or you can go completly anonymously via crypto. Also you can withdraw using crypto without any further confirmation of your real identity. Thanks for bitcoin and other crypto. Its much easier and comfortable to use crypto... Do you member the days when it was easier to get copy of the game from internet easier and faster than buy it and deal with antipiracy software/checking? This is the same time for the crypto.

"How are Bitcoins generated, a step by step guide","# How are Bitcoins generated? – The complete process of setting up a miner

Bitcoin is the first digital cryptocurrency based on the blockchain technology.

Why We Are Here,"With the bear market ensuing it is more important than ever to remember why we are here in the first place and why I am staying...

We are here because we know something is very wrong in the world. We know that the international monetary system, based on the US dollar, is profoundly corrupt. Why? Because it allows one country to print paper money out of thin air and redeem it for energy and other valuable goods and resources produced by other countries. Thereby enabling the people of that country (or more precisely a small segment of the people in that country) to live at the expense of the rest of humanity. This rigged printing system debases the US dollar after it is spent by the small but powerful few who control its supply. This act robbery is called inflation and year on year it systematically robs all nations and people who have to hold wealth in the US dollar.

We know this absurd privilege is jealously guarded – hence the almost permanent wars in the Middle East and the ceaseless mainstream media propaganda of ‘Terror’ that accompanies the drums of war. This despicable system can only be described as a protection racket. The fact that this system is all encompassing – excluding only a very limited number of jurisdictions – is frightening dystopian nightmare.

We are here because we regret a system of financial repression that enslaves most of humanity by requiring them to accept worthless paper promises issued by their respective elites in exchange for their daily hard work. Or requires them to borrow at extortionate interest rates this same worthless fiat.

We are here because we regret the fiat money system. A system that prints money at will – gifting it into an extremely small group of financial institutions for them to exercise control over us. A system that prevents saving, that creates an artificial illusion of scarcity when we could so easily have a system of abundance, based on sound money.

If only we could overthrow the small coterie of corrupt elites – the ungodly alliance between the money\-printing cartel (the banks centred around the BIS) and the military\-industrial complex (the mercenaries of death centred around Washington and the Pentagon).

What gives them the power to control us? Money. Their control of money and the political narrative around money. Their use of our sheep\-like behaviour in meekly accepting their worthless paper promises. Their use of the welfare state to buy acquiescence, to issue small bribes on a continuous basis in order to maintain the calculus of consent. Our craven willingness, imbued from birth and relentlessly drilled into us every day at school, to accept the boundaries of consciousness set by the state and surrender all faculties of critical thinking.

Hence bitcoin. Hence crypto. Bitcoin (and its ancillary protocols) is devised to be everything that fiat money is not. It is deflationary where the existing system is wildly inflationary. It is an anchor in a safe harbour whilst the existing system demands that we should be permanently at sea and should never find rest. It demands personal responsibility and self\-actualisation while the existing system encourages childish selfishness, endless self\-indulgence and a culture of entitlement. It is permissionless and free where the existing system is weighed down by command and control and the Kafkaesque tyranny of “compliance.” It is non\-political and decentralised whereas existing currencies are political and are thereby used as a means of financing war and suppressing dissent.

We aim to cast off the fetters of fiat and save humanity from the existing system of slavery which masquerades as progressive liberalism. We aim to dispossess the banks and the mercenaries of death. We aim to be free.

Welcome to the revolution.

Future in Focus: ADAMANT Messenger,"With the rapidly developing technologies in the modern world the risk of jeopardizing one’s privacy is growing. When it comes to messaging applications, the users are mostly required to verify their identity, providing huge amounts of personal data, including phone numbers, addresses, photos, which makes them vulnerable to the attacks which are aimed at stealing private information.
This data is stored on servers that can be hacked despite all security measures. And users do not know how their personal data will be used by criminals after being stolen.

Even if your data is not stolen, a lot of messengers can be used for creating a clone of your account, copying photos, naming other things with your name and sending out fraudulent messages that would damage your or your friends' image.

The problem of anonymity can be solved with the help of blockchain technology. There is no doubt in the availability of cryptocurrency for transferring information about transactions. Moreover, blockchain can be used for sending messages as well.

One of the blockchain projects which stand out of the crowd is ADAMANT. The ADAMANT project is made to respond to the question of trust in private data transfer security, since it is based on a proven to be robust Blockchain conception, and its program code is open and public.

As the developers of the project state, ADAMANT has such distinctive security and anonymity features as:

•	All messages are directly stored in the blockchain
•	The is no access to the user’s address book
•	The is no access to the user’s location information
•	No user identifications - a complete anonymity of use
•	All messages are fully encrypted on the sender’s device and then decrypted on the recipient side
•	The client app does never transfer a user’s Private Key or mnemonic phrase over the network
•	No user Private Data is being transferred
•	The message history is never stored on a device and is directly loaded from the blockchain
•	It is impossible to obtain the user’s IP-address
•	The program code for ADAMANT Messenger and blockchain are openly sourced
•	ADAMANT accounts can not be closed, blocked or limited by anyone, including the developers

Proof of BU node count manipulation,"Do you remember the Bitcoin Unlimited / Emergent Consensus debate from middle of last year? You may remember this page which still counts the number of nodes that supported the BU network:

[https://coin.dance/nodes/unlimited](https://coin.dance/nodes/unlimited)

Look at the sharp drop at around 2018\-02\-10. It looks like one person or entity swithed off one or two node farm(s). This is clear proof that from the average \~600 to maximum \~1000 BU nodes (at least!) 400 have been fake nodes. It is not very common that we find such clear evidence of manipulation.

So, next time Roger Ver and his cronies are telling you something about ""community support"" show them this graph. Whatever numbers they present, they are not trustworthy.

So what IS the solution to Bitcoin's ludicrous power demands?,"See here. Bitcoin requiring constant GW scale power supply for the mining farms is not a myth. 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-bitcoin-quebec/canadas-quebec-halts-crypto-mining-projects-may-raise-fees-idUSKCN1J31Q5

Besides being environmentally offensive, that sort of thing puts the off switch in the hands of the utility companies. Pay or else. It also is an obvious real-world scaling issue because if nothing else miners, as in Quebec, will quickly exceed the spare generation capacity. Then the miners will either not be able to scale up further OR will be charged rates such that they cannot make profit. Or they'll just get banned if it causes a brownout or any other problem for the population at large. 

Real world physical constraints beat math. 

So how does Bitcoin either manage to grow adoption to be used in wide scale transactions with this problem for existing transaction levels or, alternatively, scale back the network infrastructure a few orders of magnitude (and KEEP it down) without triggering a 51% problem? 

Distributed renewables obviously don't work here for the same reason few are comfortable entrusting 24/7 things like the Pentagon and aluminum smelting to solar or wind.

"BFX, the 30 million USD asset-backed entertainment Crypto showcases its strengths","BFX, the 30 million USD asset-backed entertainment Crypto showcases its strengths. Soon listing on Top Exchanges

BFX of BFX Cryptoworks Ltd is an asset-based cryptocurrency valued over $30 million in the entertainment industry. BFX is truly the “crypto for the masses”, with the goal to bridge the gap between blockchain token industry and the traditional world of entertainment.
The BFX is fully backed up by Bluefox Motion Pictures Pvt, a household name in a film industry that had over $50 million turn-over through the production of 12 major film projects and other smaller projects across India and other parts of Europe and America. This feat was achieved within three years, and the entertainment enthusiasts should watch out for a billion dollars turn-over in the next three years with the inclusion of blockchain technology into its’ mainstream business.
The use cases of BFX Cryptocurrency will be in the entertainment, production industry, gaming and travel industry.The coin would be used as a transaction currency to many merchant websites and travel eco-systems, eliminating middlemen’s activities within the film producers/artists, cinema viewers/fans, travelers and hotel owners. This will bring parity for revenue generation and more income earnings to the players in the industry, the investors and the end-users. BFX Cryptoworks has struck a deal with travel portals, online gaming platforms and entertainment centers where users can purchase products and services in exchange of the 'BFX Coin', and this’s starting in the 3rd quarter of 2018.

An Entertainment Currency 

BFX coin is a cryptocurrency asset that can be exchanged for entertainment products and services and converted into any fiat currency.  It was launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) in November 2017, and  $10 million was raised at the end of the exercise. Part of the proceeds from the ICO was used to produce a thriller movie called “Screwdriver” slated to be released this summer.
BFX coin is the new digital fuel to enable users to navigate through the world of entertainment to buy products and services faster and without any intrusion to their privacy.
BFX developers added hybrid PoW+PoS censuses mechanism built on the most secure blockchain script algorithm having a block-size of 8 MB, and a new block generated every six minutes that guarantees faster transaction speeds. The total supply of BFX is capped at one billion coins, and this staggering figure could make a significant impact in the blockchain entertainment industry.
Also, BFX Cryptoworks developed a new multi-coin mobile App for its’ users to trade and exchange BFX with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ripple (XRP). This App is compatible with the IOS enabled devices, Android devices and can be downloaded on Google Play.
BFX ensures funds ‘safety and user privacy with improved KYC, user ID, Local photo address proof and copies of latest income tax details for users in India.

BFX Token Now Available on Top Crypto Exchanges

BFX Cryptoworks has announced its plans to enlist  BFX in the top “exchanges” from the third week of June 2018.
From the third week of June, BFX users will be privileged to trade BFX in major exchanges globally such as KuCoin, Bibox, Bitz and many more.

WHY IS BFX PROBABLY THE NEXT BIG THING?

Unlike many cryptocurrencies, BFX is an existing business. The BFX parent company ""Bluefox Motion Pictures"" is a film production outfit with over 50 million USD turnover and has successfully produced over 12 projects within two years.
BFX Cryptoworks has made BFX, a global brand by partnering with the movers and shakers of the entertainment industry like, Sohail Khan Production(a household name in filmmaking business in India), which is to share their revenues through world celeb tours, motion pictures, and sports events. This revenue will be used as a backup and for the strengthening of the BFX platform for the next three years.
BFX story is not new; it started in 2015; the owners have a network, trust and established contracts with award-winning French and Spanish filmmakers. BFX is not relenting with its’ innovative tech and crowdfunding concepts; there’s never been a quarter, where innovation is not added to its ‘catalogue.
The user's strength is growing exponentially since the ICO launch in November 2017 with 50,000 active BFX users presently.

Future Plans

The initial plan of embarking in ICO lunch last year was to raise $50 million for the on-going projects, but $10 million was raised. The remaining $40 has to be raised in the next crowd-funding coming up in the 4th quarter of this year to enable BFX Cryptoworks to complete the on-going projects. Investors should look forward to a bumper package, for this will allow people from all over the world to invest with any amount of money in startup ventures. 
According to Mr. Prashant Wig, the spokesperson for BFX “We are building a platform for entrepreneurs to present their ideas to the world, and make six figure income”.
BFX Cryptoworks is expanding the market and the mining activities by building a nine MW mining farm in Tbilisi Georgia. The project is near completion.
The amount raised through the ICO will also be used to rebrand movies like “The Uninvited Guest,” an award-winning Spanish film to be re-made in two languages. The project will be shot in Georgia and U.K. in August this year. 
Also, BFX Cryptoworks will embark on setting up a BFX Shopping Mall, an online retail outlet that will allow people to shop in malls using BFX Coin for exchange, without the need to carry fiat or credit cards. 

CONCLUSION

BFX is a real hidden gem in the world of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have a lot of hype, and sometimes the technology often creates a detachment from the happenings in the real world: I have seen hundreds of millions of dollars worth projects ""POST-FUNDRAISING"" displaying only a tech whitepaper and a good looking website. Most of the time, these startups remain extraordinarily technical and a blockchain solution without really having a  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT blueprint.  BFX is business oriented.
BFX has many on-going projects, an indication of how visionary the management team is and the listing of BFX to more exchanges, the market has no limits for BFX.

"We are living in the currency dark ages. The movement away from the gold standard has been a set back for the human race in general. An exceprt from ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Safiedean Ammous.","""It is an astonishing fact of modern life that an entrepreneur in the year 1900 could make global economic plans and calculations all denominated in any international currency, with no thought whatsoever given to exchange rate fluctuations. A century later, the equivalent entrepreneur trying to make an economic plan across borders faces an array of highly volatile exchange rates that might make him think he has walked into a Salvador Dali painting. Any sane analyst looking at this mess would conclude it would be best to just tie the value of money to gold again and be rid of this juggling act, thus solving the Impossible Trinity by eliminating the need for government‐controlled monetary policy, and having free capital movement and free trade. This would at once create economic stability and free up a large amount of capital and resources to the production of valuable goods and services, rather than speculation on complex exchange rate oscillations.""

Obtaining Lightning network graph data,"Hi all,

I was wondering if it is possible for me to obtain data about the Lightning network mainnet, particularly the nodes and the edges (channels) in the network. I know that the graph is visualized in explorers such as [https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/) and [https://graph.lndexplorer.com/](https://graph.lndexplorer.com/). I wish to obtain the data itself so I can reconstruct the graph and run some network simulations for my research. I understand that the standard way is to run a Lightning node yourself and then sync for the network's topology through your node. However, I do not have access to the computational resources and memory to run a full Lightning node. 

If anyone knows of a way I can obtain the data without having to run a Lightning node, or has the data and is willing to share it for purely research purposes, it would be of tremendous help.

Thank you!",1528862201,13/06/2018 03:56:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qpfcw/obtaining_lightning_network_graph_data/,1

In business terms basically, a commodity is defined as any good or service that can be bought or sold by only means of price. A commodity can also include a particular product which is not much different from its counterparts based on benefit, brand, and many other factors.

Learn to love the dip.,"Imagine a day with a really long downward wick. Imagine the rush you'd feel if you caught the bottom of the wick and maybe doubled your money in only a few hours. Exhilarating, right? Now imagine the disappointment you'd feel if you saw that long wick and you missed it. Damn! Those dips need to last longer, don't they?

They sure do, and that's why they invented something called the market cycle. The market cycle is basically one big dip, and it happen in stages. The bear cycle begins after the excitement gets a little bit out of hand and everyone starts hitting the ""buy"" button merely because it's what everyone else is doing. It's like the hangover after the party. If you were one of the ones who got carried away, you're going to have a massive financial hangover. If you're smart, you can still turn the situation around and use it as a buying opportunity.

Making money from the market requires only two simple steps: buying low, and selling high. Although all the excitement comes from selling high, you can't sell high unless you buy low. Late 2017 was the time for selling high. Now is the time for buying low. If you're in the market for quick returns, GTFO now because we are heading for an extended bear cycle. In my opinion, we have a minimum of 4 months of continued bearishness, and probably a lot more. Why is that? A lot of long term hodlers decided to [cash out](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-decline-caused-by-hodlers-unprecedented-30-billion-sell-off-research/) in this last bubble. After years of holding an asset that was trading sideways to down, a bull market finally rolled around and they decided to reap the rewards of their foresight and patience when everything got out of hand and parabolic. So, the amount of supply in the market has increased by over 50%, while demand has dropped off by more than two thirds (or more), as many people who were here for a quick buck have skedaddled. Hmm, higher supply and decreasing demand? What does that do to the price?  Gee, I wonder. It's almost like there's a mathematical formula or something.

During the bear market cycle, smart money will begin accumulating, buying bitcoin in small amounts over time. This will contract the supply until price begins to rise again. They don't want to inflate the price, so they will probably buy small amounts secretly. The dumb money won't know what is happening until the price is suddenly 10k again. The rising price will attract buyers, which in turn will increase volume. When it's time for the smart money to dump their bags on the next set of bag holders, they may even start shilling crypto on mainstream media.

Now is the chance to buy low and accumulate. If you're considering a panic-sell, you probably aren't here for the right reasons. Now, if we break 6k, that will constitute a break of market structure and is a very bearish development. You should probably assume that this is another 2014. Unlike 2014, however, the bitcoin network is much stronger and more developed. In 2014 fundamentals were hazy and many people associated bitcoin with illegal activity on the darknet, lending a negative stigma that persists to this day. However, 2017 sent a loud and clear message to the smart money and institutions: bitcoin and crypto are here to stay.

So, the best strategy is probably to practice dollar cost averaging. This is where you buy a certain amount of bitcoin each month or week. This reduces your chances of buying high or fomo buying. Another strategy is to ""ladder in"". This is when you set buy orders of increasingly large sizes at lower prices. You don't know where the bottom will be, so it's best that you don't try to knife-catch.

Good luck. Remember that the future is bright for bitcoin. Just because the price is going down and the irrational hype is over doesn't mean that bitcoin isn't going to change the world.",1528867970,13/06/2018 05:32:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qpycq/learn_to_love_the_dip/,1

Keep away from Coinbase,"I have just failed in an attempt to setup a Coinbase account.

In a standard AML/KYC procedure, Coinbase asked me to provide my home address. Unfortunately, they do not let you enter the country, but default to a match based on the client's IP. Then, I contacted the supported and was told that I should repeat the address entry while I am back in the country I live in. Worth mentioning that, meanwhile, my funds have been frozen. 

I've returned but it didn't work, either. The support told me to reset all cookies, caches, etc. I have even used another browser, one that didn't know Coinbase before. It didn't help. I've contacted Coinbase again, but was told they are going to talk to a specialist. No response since then, even though I have been urging support to get an answer.

I do not understand their policy. You are forced to provide your address under legal responsibility and at the same time they freeze the country based on such a vague idea as IP geographical location.

Keep going down. That's fine. Accumulate more and I will see y'all in the citadels.,"Hyperbitcoinization is happening sometime. The following applies to working middle class money type folks.

If the btc price gets cheaper, we can get a bigger piece of the pie. Maybe the one million club is starting to seem attainable again for some of us. 

If the price would have just kept on going with us sitting at like $80,000 right now, you would have about the same amount of BTC as you did in December, even if you bought the whole way up.

This bear market gives us the opportunity to get a higher percentage of the BTC in existence. The key is to be productive ""in fiat"" and put your savings into BTC so that you can take advantage of these discount BTC times.

Of course make sure that you are being productive by serving your fellow man. Many things that are supported by taxes or through the regulated financial system will no longer be viable. Just be aware of this.

This leads us to the biggest benefit of bitcoin. Money will be invisible. We will have to serve each other voluntarily to get bitcoin. The biggest buildings in each city all have bank names on them. The stadiums and ballparks are named after banks. That's going to change. You won't get rich by fucking with money (printing it, stealing it, trading it). You get rich by doing real work to make life better for yourself and others.

When a higher percentage of mankind is serving ice cream than bombs, it's going to be great.

Accumulate and get productive to accumulate more. 

See y'all at the citadels.",1528895458,13/06/2018 13:10:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qsavd/keep_going_down_thats_fine_accumulate_more_and_i/,1

"Lets all agree on last years' Tether manipulation, its ok. Move on. We are all in this together.","In case you are wondering about the Tether articles , please get your shit and facts straight and not be delusional.

Tether was supposedly be backed up by real dollars, i dont BELIEVE that this promise was held by any exchange here.

And coming to think of it , so what?

Dollar was also supposed to be backed up by gold reserves , is it correct?

Well... Is it?

No.

The US government is constantly printing new money out of thin air , but nobody seems to care? Why is that?

Because they are in consensus. They have aggreed not to discuss and simply deny the accusations , and so the out of air dollar printing has become something like an urban legend.

And now we are here, discussing about whether Tether, that was originally backed up by piece of paper, call me dollar , was the reason why BTC prices were manipulated.

I say Yes. But so what?

In this world economy, nothing is really backed up by any commodity. Why dont we all agree on that and move on?

BTC is falling most probably because the early adopters , those who were lucky enough to hold BTC when its price was less than a dollar or those who mined BTC back in the days , when a whole BTC could be mined in a day on a 2GB video card, decided to get their profits.

Wouldnt we all have done it if we were in their lucky shoes?

The market needs new money , the so called market cap is based on BTC/FIAT evaluation , but no real money can back this cap. So, real money MUST be created \- by selling to FIAT\- and then RE ENTER the market in order to base the new market structure,  provide stable foundations.

Right now the market influx of FIAT currency is nothing but a fragment in terms of total market cap evaluation.

In real life terms , the market cap is aroung 300 billion dollars. This doesnt mean that people have invested 300 billion dollars rather than the value of all coins is estimated to that figure. The real money in the market are far far less than that.

Thats why we see all these sudden price fluctuations, there are no stable foundations. The order books are full of non realistic orders that are serving as sell/buy walls and the bots trading orders in volume less that a dollar, which are not real. They are there in order to provide a backing up , keep the prices at a specific level , or increase the prices by placing a 10$ order at a time. So simple.Spend some time on your monitor and you ll know what i am saying.

The real orders , the ones that you and me are placing are the real ones. But our buying power cannot sustain these price levels.

Thats why the prices are on  a constant drop.

New money need to  enter the market , and the only way of this happening is by allowing liquidation , profit taking , and then reinvesting in order for the market to really shine. And yes the whales will once again do this.

So, what if Tether was used to inflate prices? No big deal. At least we are aware of it UNLIKE goverments and banks who are creating new , no backed up currencies out of thin air and yet allow poverty and inequality to thrive on  a global basis.

We are messing in their playground here , and these players are golden league guys.

This is not a game, this is a deliberate attempt of the system to keep their power and the wealth centralized and controlled.

We cannot be fooled , we cant allow it.

TL;DR

Be patient , this is war. Keep your shit straight. Think on a longterm basis. Stop falling for paid articles and FUD. Media are companies , companies goal is to profit,never forget that.

I am holding, buying, trading. I am not blindsighted and i wont quit so easily. I urge you to do the same. We are all in this together.

Let it all unfold, let the market do its cycle. The next bull run will be better , stronger, and this time based on a solid ground.

This isn’t FUD but ????,I’ve been in crypto since December 2017. Yes I know I was in at the peak of the crypto markets. Although I’ve been buying the dips every single week of crypto.

I understand “HODL” and I’m not going to sell any of my crypto even if it goes to zero. But should I really keep investing? Please explain why. Don’t give me an answer like “whatever dude just HODL were going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀😝😎😎😎” or “ dude you have weak hands pshhhh keep selling so I can see some mad gains” 💪💪💪.

I'm Getting Hacked so Bad Trying to Post Online about Bitcoin,"I've been told to remain anonymous about Bitcoin, but sometimes I feel it's safer to be out in the open. I know Bitcoin is part of the crypto anarchy movement and being a part of it puts you against the corrupt Federal Reserve who has been running the show for a while. Just ask Edward Snowden, they are keeping track of the Bitcoin community.  But I got nothing to fear. I'm not afraid to die. Them being so opposed and having my computer with infinite tab refreshes every time I try to make a Facebook, freezing my mouse every time I try to post a YouTube video, or a console box appearing on my mainframe titled ""Killer Control"" just demonstrates that Bitcoin must be something good. So before you hear a news story that Andrew Thomas Lester from Lincoln, Nebraska hung himself in his basement because he was seriously mentally ill, just know it's not true. I'm happy as a clam enjoying every day talking about Jesus and empowering technology. I'm hanging out by the pool enjoying the sun, riding my skateboard to church, and blowing massive vape clouds to my neighbor's concern. I love everyone, including those corrupted by power clinging on desperately for their control of this world. Despite this world's dysfunction, I couldn't love life more. I love you guys so much. I'm glad I found Reddit. Good luck with your venture. I'm gonna take a break from all this. Find me on Halo 5, gamertag INC0RP0REAL. (Zeroes not O's)

Bitcoin price plunges after hack in South Korea (xpost r/dailydot),,1528913198,13/06/2018 18:06:38,https://www.dailydot.com/debug/bitcoin-price-plunges/,1
Nixon,"Does anybody know or understand that the market is a consensus based system. It allows buyers and sellers to set prices. We can rely on that because there is no one to control those prices. So we think. Markets work best to price the supply of goods and services to be sold. Goods and services are practically unlimited. 

But here is the issue. Bitcoin is money. It can’t be printed out of thin air unlimitedly. It has rules they
We all agree to follow. We have been following these rules for almost 10 years. The network has grown and now we are at a point where we accept it as digital gold. That is the problem. Yet we are making a payment layer to use it as cash. How ironic?  

How does this relate to Nixon. Well Nixon with the stroke of a pen ended the Bretton Woods act. He didn’t wait for the market to say it was ok. He just did it. And after that the financial system has moved from a petro dollar to a debt based dollar. None of this was decided by the market. 

Now what is my point. Today we use markets to allocate capital for its best use. Until we got bitcoin. What started off as a simple concept has now become a war. This war involves no bombs. It involves your mind. They have been using money as a way to control for so long they are really good at it. And the best way to control bitcoin is to use the exchanges to control the price. It’s no different than what they do with gold. This is what you are seeing. 

They know the best way to keep bitcoin from being circulated is to keep the price low enough where it is appealing enough to own. But not appealing enough to spend. But why? Because banks will do anything to keep you on their system. That’s why we have Blockchain not bitcoin. That’s why we have a thousand shitcoins too. This is all made to keep bitcoin less desirable. 

Gresham law states bad money chases out good money. But extend this to a digital vs physical money. Digital money will chase out physical money. It cost less and is easier to use. But banks don’t want you using digital bitcoin. They want you to use their digital money. It’s always about control to them. Money is in unlimited supply. 

How do we overcome this. It’s pretty radical of a concept. Bitcoin is widely known and has global infrastructure behind it. It is growing. That what you want to see. But the exchanges have and are being used to slow this growth through the pricing mechanism. So we just reject the pricing mechanism and use something new. I can buy an unlimited amount of Coca Cola for $1. But why can’t I buy 100 satoshi’s for $1. I can. And if enough people decide to do this it becomes the consensus. Just like in a market. 

But why? Because global debt exceed GDP by 300%. Who owns this debt? The banks and central banks of course. So they can do whatever they want. And they are. Politicians are catering to them to keep from blowing up their economies. This is why we have bitcoin. It’s our protection from this screwd up banking system. Pierre calls it hyperbitcoinization. But the reality is within this construct of money and faith based system we have something that truly changes everything. Yet we are still playing by their rules. 

All it took was the signature of Nixon. With bitcoin all it takes is our will to pay $1 for 100 satoshi’s. And if the market feels this price is too high and floods it with coins it doesn’t matter. Because you don’t need a weaponized market that will do their bidding. Some ppl will get super rich. My hope is we will have more good actors with btc than we have malicious ones. And we can move into a future where the power of the few can no longer control the fate of the many. And if nation states want to keep their central banks it’s ok. But we don’t have to use their money system. ",1528913385,13/06/2018 18:09:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8quma7/nixon/,1
The Internet of Money: Five Years Later,"Hey guys, if you have the time to watch the opening 10 minutes, you'll start to feel better. The master Andreas in his prime. 

We are not the faint hearted, we are not the speculative investors involved with QE inflation based fiat currencies, currently running 21 trillion in federal debt, housing bubble, student debt, healthcare, state pension liabilities, SnP the list goes on... 

We are involved with the future of the planet and more so, the human race. 

We are involved in revolutionising the way that human beings view and control power within their species. Whether we go to war with certain countries in order for a select few to make money, whether we vote in another shit\-head politician who repeats the same tripe as the next. 

This is the next revolution, the levelling of power, the end of the pyramid scheme upon which our current state of planetary affairs run. 

If bitcoin fails, if crypto\-currency fails, we as a species have failed. 

Have faith my friends, not in the price speculation that is ever present, but in the underlying technology that advances every day and is being built into something truly and irrefutably beautiful. 

Something without censorship or governmental control, something within which every human being has a say and does not need to kowtow to some reigning authority figure.

Believe in Bitcoin, believe in the human species.",1528913545,13/06/2018 18:12:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qun5d/the_internet_of_money_five_years_later/,1

my magic internet money story,"I first heard of bitcoin on Yahoo when the price reached more than $1,000 back in 2013. I read about Satoshi on Wikipedia and was fascinated by his white paper and bitcoin. I considered buying bitcoin at the time but didn't really know where to buy.

Last year, I heard about bitcoin on Yahoo again, but the price was already at $4000. Wow, what a mistake. I should've bought back in 2014 when the prices were less than $1000.

I am not making that mistake again. I have been buying at 9k, 8k, 7k and today at 6k. And I sure as hell will keep buying at 5K and 4K.

I made an app to charge with bitcoin aimed to merchants (specially Venezuelans),"Hi,

I made an app to charge your clients or friends with Bitcoin. That means, you type the amount you want to charge in fiat, choose a destination wallet, and the app give you a Bitcoin payment link that you can show to your clients with a QR code, copy to the clipboard or share with other apps.

The app does not handle your private keys, so it’s ideal to use with your employees own devices or to with a store shared computer. You add wallets to the app with their public addresses.

Other things that you can do:
* Watch several wallets, and their movements, with the amounts translated to your favorite fiat.
* Calculator, price charts.

**Why it is aimed specially to Venezuelans?**
The app is aimed to any merchant, but could be interesting for Venezuelans because of the Bolivar / Bitcoin exchange rates. Most apps out there use the official VEF/USD exchange rate and then convert to Bitcoin. That would mean huge loses for the seller, given that the official rate differs in several orders of magnitude from any market-based rate.  But my app uses the exchange rates given by Bitcoin Venezuela’s API (https://www.bitcoinvenezuela.com/), a web that estimate the exchange rates from market prices at Local Bitcoins (https://localbitcoins.com/).

The app is localized in English and Spanish (named “Pay me with Bitcoin” and “Págame con Bitcoin” respectively).

**Available in…**
Google Play and the Microsoft Store (for Windows 10 desktop mobile). I developed the app with Xamarin Forms with iOS in mind, so it should be trivial to port to iOS, but I cannot afford the Apple Store fee and I don’t have access to a Mac at the moment.

**Future**
If there is any interest in the app, I would like to:

Either support Coinbase Commerce or implement Bip32 myself, so every ticket (charge) that you generate with the app go to a different wallet, derived from a master public key. I this way you client won’t know how much money you make / have, and you would get confirmations for every ticket, avoiding confusions.

The app should also use notifications for when a payment is received.

And of course, iOS.

Today I onboarded 2 institutional investors,"I was invited to speak for \~30 CFOs and COOs of European Investments funds about Bitcoin and ""Blockchain"". It's a small sample group, but here are some takeaways people may find interesting:

* Most of them were very surprised when they found out Bitcoin isn't primarily used by criminals and that it's not the protocol, but exchanges that are getting hacked. The influence of the media is strong.
* Some of them read that Bitcoin is V1 and something else with better technology will emerge to overtake it. They thought they missed the boat on Bitcoin and were looking for this next thing. (I explained that most inventions can be copied by people working on projects with larger network effects)
* The expectations of what Smart Contracts will do were huge.
* Regulation is a big question mark to them and has held them back from getting involved.
* They were very skeptical about ""blockchain"" (permissioned blockchains) because they didn't see immediate use cases of the database for their business.

2 CFOs came up to me after the presentation to tell me they literally just bought bitcoin after my talk to try it out. I never sell my audience on anything, they simply got excited (happens sometimes). I of course had to tell them to move their purchases into their own wallets.

It may not be their organisations putting in money, but it's a start. These people need simple education just as much as anyone out there.

Offline Bitcoin Transactions with Short Message Authentication Protocol,"Would it be possible to develop a layer 2 solution that works well in delay tolerant network environments? From my understanding, the purpose of most layer 2 off-chain solutions such as Lightning Network is to delay settlement onto the blockchain until a later point of time, but when a client has intermittent access to the internet, it is branded as non-responsive. Non-responsive clients are a liability to their peers, as if a peer has bitcoin tied up in the channel, it is stuck there until the timeout period. Now envisage a scenario in a third world country, where you have sporadic network access - would you have to rely on third-parties to settle your payments when you're offline?

I started thinking at this point... it would be possible to create a layer 2 solution that works on the basis of Message Authentication Codes (MAC) which establish an agreement between the payer and payee? This protocol enables value to be transferred from Alice to Bob by copying 8 digits in one direction and 8 digits in another. The code is computed using secret keys assigned to each participant, which is based on several parameters. Both systems are completely offline, so it is important that both the transaction is capable of validating without access to an internet connection.

The steps outlined to complete this transaction are as follows:

* Alice agrees to pay Bob X.
* Bob enters into phone the transaction amount X and Alice's phone number A. Bob's phone then generates a random 4 digit nonce (NB). Then it computes a MAC on A, B, NB, X and the log of the previous transactions T between the two parties. The MAC and the nonce together make up the 8 digit Code 1.
* Alice enters into her phone the transaction amount X and Bob's phone number A. It prompts her for Code 1, which she asks Bob for and enters. If there is a disagreement at this stage, or attempted cheating by Bob, then Alice's phone will generate an error.
* If Code 1 is correct, then Alice's account's available balance is decreased by the transaction amount X and then generates Code 2 to authenticate the transaction. Code 2 is 8 digits long, it consists of a random 4 digit nonce (NA) generated by Alice's phone, and 4 digits from a MAC on A, B, NB, X and the log of the previous transactions T between the two parties.
* Alice then gives Code 2 to Bob. If it is valid, then Bob's account balance is incremented by X.
* A confirmation message is displayed to both Alice and Bob confirming the completion of the transaction.

Now there's a number of security implications here - what's to stop Alice from tampering with things on her end to just ""forget"" the transaction took place? 

An example:

* Alice sets up an offline account with 1 BTC in it. Alice then takes a snapshot of the state of her account.
* Alice then spends 0.5 BTC with Bob. This is an offline transaction so the only basis Bob has to go on that Alice has the funds is Alice's digital wallet. The transaction goes through, Bob is assumably happy with his decentralised money.
* Alice then resets the state of her digital wallet to before the transaction. Suddenly she has 1 BTC again and goes and spends more money. As far as Bob's concerned he's been paid, but there's no external verification.

Now, even if Bob posts the transaction information down the road and Alice's real account is billed, Alice still has an offline digital wallet with $100 in it that no-one verifies. She essentially can spend this repeatedly.As the transaction needs to be trustless and operate offline with intermittent access to the internet, how would such a problem be resolved? Essentially it currently relies on the integrity of a secret key to prevent rolling-back/double-spends, and in the event that one person gets the secret key the trust disintegrates because with the same algorithm you can generate whichever codes you want. Would 2 nodes who have transacted in a offline bidirectional channel need to be penalised if they do not go online frequently enough (i.e. once a week) to sync their balances?",1528935448,14/06/2018 00:17:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qxffp/offline_bitcoin_transactions_with_short_message/,1

Pay close attention to Japan,"So I’ve been noticing a trend. On relatively high volume sell days like today, Japan (ie Bitflyer) comes out of the woods and jumps high on the bitcoin volume list. This is a good indicator that they are accumulating on the dips. Something similar happened last year when the bitcoin price was fighting with a descent under 3000. South korean volume grew higher on every dip before it blossomed well above that mark.

Cant help me think of 2008 when China and Japan came in at the last minute to save the U.S. banks JUST before they failed. These countries have always played the long game and really know how to buy low.

"We are in capitulation. Notice all of the people who, at $7K, were like ""I'm done with this crap, I'm out""","And now the market did it's intentional dip further below the $7K mark.  It makes those people who threw in the towel go, ""Ha, hey, look, I told you I was right.  I'm so smart I beat this market.""
  
Less than a month later, it bounces to $7500 and makes those people say ""well, it's going to drop more.  I'm telling you, it will.""
  
And then?  It hits $10K.  Those people still aren't believing it.  They're still thinking they did the right thing.  But they've got just a *slight bit of a salt* going on.
  
Then, $15K.  They just truly can't believe it.  Now they're super pissed and they're done with the markets for absolute ever.

An Introduction to Bitcoin Wallets for Beginners,"Hello!

I'm Malcolm Rose. For some time now I've been writing articles about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency in order to educate people who otherwise might not be that interested. The goal is to take away as many of the technical buzzwords as possible in order to make Bitcoin simple to understand - after all, people might take more of an interest if the learning curve wasn't so steep. Imagine if there were resources you could send to your friends and family which didn't feel like a chore to read!

To that end I've created my website Rose Crypto, where I recently wrote an article about [Bitcoin for beginners](https://rosecrypto.com/What-Is-Bitcoin). Furthering that series, today I've come out with a new article which focuses on [Bitcoin wallets for beginners](https://rosecrypto.com/Bitcoin-Wallets). While this article focuses heavily on my preferred wallet (Coinomi), it also does a good job of quickly giving people an understanding of what a wallet is, what a wallet does, and what their options are.

So, please, let me know what you think of my [latest work](https://rosecrypto.com/Bitcoin-Wallets) - and thanks for reading!

A professor and a graduate from the University of Texas, finance department, felt it necessary to write a detailed 66 page analysis of the role of Tether in the 2017 rise of Bitcoin.

It only costs a few cents to produce a can of coke. They sell for ~$1.50.,"This whole conversation about the cost of mining is getting tedious.

The value of a product is not it's cost but cost plus utility value and other things such as perceived value or added value.

There is no point in mining at cost unless your interest is in freshly minted coins with no history or the intention to secure the network (ie, secure your existing holdings).

The only people who have a serious interest in the cost other than the miners are the actuaries that work for banks so they can establish what the theoretical price floor is in order to calculate their risk metrics.

Who f'n cares? Besides, they've already got that part figured out and are currently stock piling quietly as we are now into cost price levels. Personally I'd sleep better at night knowing the get their math wrong.

For everyone else who is not a bank actuary, the stable market price is cost + lots of other factors. Just like a can of coke.

Next time someone claims the value of BTC is the cost of mining, please slap them.

There is more to Blockchain Innovation : JP Morgan,"## JP Morgan on Blockchain Innovation

JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.’s (JPM) distributed ledger venture, Quorum, recently made news when its head, Amber Baldet, moved on to start her own [venture](https://coinnounce.com/bitcoin-authentic-gold-miners-subjugated/). But her shoes are filled in by Christine Moy.

Christine Moy started her career in the middle office of JP Morgan’s syndicated loans business. In this job, Moy had to deal with all the documents that needed to be signed before these transactions could close. She then spent over a decade working across a range of assets and divisions at the bank. This cross\-training included witnessing how securities and chains of custody were frozen solid as the 2008 crash engulfed the [entire financial system](https://coinnounce.com/austrias-financial-market-authority-bans-activities-of-digital-currency-mining-firm/). That experience underscored for her the importance of a transparent system of reconciliation just as the syndicated loans role drove home the need for faster settlements. With all this insight she was the first choice and new program lead for the Blockchain Centre of Excellence (BCOE) at JP Morgan.

Cryptocurrencies as alternative mean of payment to fiat money (master thesis),"Hey guys,

I need the swarm-intelligence. Currently, I am writing my master thesis about how central banks currently work and if cryptocurrencies as private money and a potential replacement to fiat money may or may not become a threat to the central bank´s ability to operate since their control about the amount of fiat money in circulation is one of their most important instruments to operate. Therfore I am in need of qualitive good articles (or even scholars) that target this or related topics.

Every hint will be much appreciated. Thanks!",1528960594,14/06/2018 07:16:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qzvos/cryptocurrencies_as_alternative_mean_of_payment/,1

What saddens me is that we are not united anymore,"I am involved since long time ago. I don't really care about the price anymore. What saddens me is that we are currently under attack.  

* First it's the division of our community in two. My personal opinion doesn't matter but we are not united anymore.
* Wherever you mention the word Bitcoin people reply like ""oh it was a bubble in the end right? I told you about the tulip story"". Many now say ""umm yes maybe it was"" instead of actively defending the technology and giving out the vision we had about global money.
* The biggest technological forum's mods, Hacker News, are haters. They downvote all comments related. But noone is there to defend.
* Everybody is focused on how to short and became a bear since February. To me shorting the most parabolic asset ever is just plain silly but many disagree. If you show the chart from 2008 to someone that doesn't know anything about it and tell them you are shorting he will conclude you are a mad man.
* We spent a tremendous amount of energy on speculation on the Tether issue while they have a system that has kept the peg always. At least let's stop spending the majority of the crypto discussions on weather they hold the reserves after 1 year because we can have this discussion in eternity it seems.

Roadmap to mass adoption of btc as currency.,"Genuinely interested to hear informed people's views. I am a long term HODLER, got in at about $300. I invested in this project because I like to think I have a libertarian/socialist streak and it's lofty aims appeal to me.

What I cannot square in my head, is how we can ever move from btc as a commodity to a currency. There is a natural urge to keep it, rather than use it (yes I am guilty of this). If the price does climb and continue to climb, what exactly would be the set of circumstances to cause people to relinquish their holding ? and indeed for others to buy it, simply to use as a currency.

Mr WU Sijin：Blockchain will break up the financial monopolies and financial agency will disappear |The Finance Executive Council (FINEC),"    On May 20th, the 2018 Blockchain and Internet Finance High-end Closed-door Conference was successfully held in Hangzhou. The event was jointly organized by the Finance Executive Council and the Hangzhou Canal Auto Internet Industrial Park. It was also supported by Zhejiang Big Data Technology Association and other units.
    Mr WU Sijin, the founder of Hangzhou Fuzamei Technology Limited (FUZAMEI) and blockchain expert , shared with over 100 senior executives that consumers, suppliers, and laborers can jointly build a shared economic ecology on the blockchain public chain. Conversely, joint-stock companies, financial institutions and other financial agencies will disappear on a large scale.

*Processing img 6n7ij4z0by311...*

FUZAMEI has already began to develop the blockchain research since 2013. Currently, accumulated number of patent applications exceeds 50, ranking the top 10 worldwide. Mr. Wu Sijin, founder of FUZAMEI, pointed out at the meeting that consumers, suppliers and workers can jointly build a shared economic ecology on the blockchain and the chain will help enterprises to get rid of dependence on traditional financial capital institutions. Intermediaries such as financial institutions will disappear in large numbers. Blockchain allows companies to package and segment debt note, which can be passed to use in the ecosystem and supply chain management. The corporate costs, therefore, can even be reduced by more than 50 percentage.

*Processing img kqx8zyz3by311...*

**The following is a record of Mr WU’s speech:**

It is a great privilege to discuss the blockchain with everyone. FUZAMEI was founded in Hangzhou in 2008. “FUZA”in English means Complexity while “MEI”in English means Beauty. The name was inspired by a book I read when I was a graduate student, “Complexity”. Life is a process from simple to complex. This is a law. The blockchain is very complicated, however, we have done it beautifully. We started to research the blockchain in 2013. In the early days, we made a blockchain wallet and accumulated more knowledge. In 2015, we visited the government to promote the blockchain, contributing to the blockchain boom in China. Also, the prosperity of blockchain companies in Hangzhou was in large part due to us.

Since we explored earlier, we have accumulatively applied for more than 50 patents, ranking the top 10 in terms of the number of patents worldwide. Blockchain patents in Hangzhou are absolutely the first in the world, including Alibaba and us. We also have many application scenarios and almost 10 of the world’s top 500 companies cooperate with us. One of the earliest cooperating project was the HNA Group (HaipingX). We made a blockchain commercial draft transaction system and currently have a turnover of 20 billion RMB.

    In 2014, FUZAMEI applied for the first blockchain invention patent: ‘the wallet recovery function’, which was authorized in December 2017. Currently, it has applied for more than 50 invention patents in the scope of blockchain technology, of which 2 have already authorized. Our main project direction is blockchain notes, receivables, prepayments, warehouse receipts, points, exchanges, etc. There are over 250 employees in the company, and 50 blockchain core developers. I believe that our company locates at the leading position worldwide in terms of the company scale and technology

*Processing img zlyjvnmbby311...*

The blockchain principle is actually not complicated. The public is unfamiliar blockchain. In fact, it can be understood in 3 minutes. As you can see, there are 10 digital ledgers in this picture, Tom has 30 rmb, and Sam has 50 rmb. Each account ledger is exactly the same. This is the first concept of the blockchain: multiple accounts records the transactions simultaneously, and each account ledger is the same and can be mutually verified. Of course, only if more than 50&amp;#37; of the nodes agree, can a transaction be successfully written to the blockchain. Next, I will introduce our company’s blockchain\-based application.

*Processing img eotu1sieby311...*

**Debt Note**

We have built up a commercial draft transaction system for HNA Group ([HaiPingX.com](https://www.haipingx.com/)). Now we are focusing on debt note projects. Take the example of supply chain in computer industry, the core company (e.g. Dell) purchases hard drives from supplier A and pays the money three months later. In traditional way, the supplier A has to borrow money from banks to maintain its production due to the payment delay. However, since the blockchain technology is traceable, the core company can issue a debt note to the supplier A as a credit proof. Then, this debt note can be fully circulated until the last owner redeems it with the core company. The circulation of debt note isolates the financial intermediaries from supply chain, significantly reducing costs and improving efficiency. It is convenient to use the debt note since it can be split as well. The blockchain\-based debt note will have a great impact on automobile industry. The corporations in this chain do not require money from financial intermediaries. Yes, the following assembly companies get debt note from core company to purchase parts, and manufacturers use the debt note to purchase raw materials. The auto industry can definitely do it. ([The detail on debt note](https://medium.com/@fuzameitwitter/debt-note-a-blockchain-solution-to-supply-chain-finance-e3f8b8e1c8e1))

*Processing img kcruy7phby311...*

**Supply Chain Management**

Supply chain management is also very important. In fact, we also talked with [Xiaomi](http://%28https//www.mi.com/index.html). It is prepared to spend a few years to make a good supply chain management system, especially in the automotive industry. In the automotive industry, there are many component manufacturers, increasing the difficulties to manage suppliers. If all information can be recorded in the blockchain including raw material procurement, semi\-finished product procurement and logistics, the entire supply chain system will be more transparent. If there are problems with quality and delayed delivery, it may be possible to use a blockchain smart contract for direct deductions or to eliminate unqualified suppliers.

*Processing img a87y1yrlby311...*

In the blockchain, any company engaging in counterfeit production can be traced back and will lose credit. Instead, trustworthy companies can accumulate credits in the blockchain to gain recognition of the entire supply chain, and even global recognition, which is helpful to expand business globally. The blockchain application in automotive industry can bond all small enterprise suppliers together, forming an ecosystem. Everyone involved will benefit from the economies of scale.

I feel like Charlie Chaplin's Speech from The Great Dictator suits in here,"When i heard the speech in 'Paolo Nutini \- Iron sky' i was thinking about Bitcoin, and how it can be applied versus the Banking system and Wall Street manipulation. ( Ofcourse the movie is about Hitler, and i am not saying banks are like Hitler ) 

But i feel this speech, how WE as citizens of the world should stand up against their power to control the people. 

And that we should not be slave's of the Banks, by following their rules, and let them control us what we do whit out own earned money.

This is the (part of the) speech Paolo Nutini uses in his song. 

""To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair  
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed  
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress  
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die  
And the power they took from the people will return to the people  
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish  
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men  
Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!  
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!  
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful  
To make this life a wonderful adventure  
Let us use that power!  
Let us all unite!""",1528976206,14/06/2018 11:36:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8r14sy/i_feel_like_charlie_chaplins_speech_from_the/,1

Merkle Roots role in large datasets,"I have a question that's been bothering me for a while. Hope this is the right place to ask.
Since it's expensive to store large datasets on chain, are there perhaps already some development around a concept to remove the core data in a block entirely from the main chain and only filling up the blocks with Merkle roots from datasets stored on participating nodes? This would apply mainly to private blockchains I think, and I'm not yet sure how the validation of data would work if there's discrepancies between the merkle roots that nodes try to publish. I'm not sure if I'm making sense here, but hope to get some sort of direction for further research.

He replied

&gt;There is no ""force"", there is choice.  Each user chooses the software they run to validate the chain.  If a majority of users choose to switch to SHA-512, that is what will happen, regardless of the number of miners who switch.

Bitcoin is the same. It doesn't matter how many institutions ""support it"", or ""back it"", or ""adopt it"". What matters is user choice - If users collectively stop accepting fiat for their work, that is what will happen, Bitcoin will prevail. (But it won't invalidate fiat, hence a soft fork.)

Lower prices remove Finite supply faster.,"The obvious thing everyone overlooks is.  It's easier to move bitcoin into cold wallets at lower price. If the price weakness is do to network issues (which it's not obviously) that is another story but in this environment?   


We can eat twice the supply at $6k than $12k removing most of what we take into long term mode with *individual hodlrs and those with plans on trading btc for products with other holders*.  in 23 months we will be getting help from the halving which will 8x the price as usual.   


Another example is the MTgox whale out there with 90k worth of btc and a few other big dumper scenarios. So why pay them double? 

We spend the next year working on apps, adoption and education and things will be even more interesting than 2017.

Price manipulation may have accounted for at least half of the increase in the price of Bitcoin,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/technology/bitcoin\-price\-manipulation.html?smid=fb\-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/technology/bitcoin-price-manipulation.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur)

SAN FRANCISCO — A concentrated campaign of price manipulation may have accounted for at least half of the increase in the price of Bitcoin and other big cryptocurrencies last year, according to a paper released on Wednesday by an academic with a history of spotting fraud in financial markets.

The paper by John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, is likely to stoke a debate about how much of Bitcoin’s skyrocketing gain last year was caused by the covert actions of a few big players, rather than real demand from investors.

Many industry players expressed concern at the time that the prices were being pushed up at least partly by activity at Bitfinex, one of the largest and least regulated exchanges in the industry. The exchange, which is registered in the Caribbean with offices in Asia, was subpoenaed by American regulators shortly after articles about the concerns appeared in The New York Times and other publications.

Mr. Griffin looked at the flow of digital tokens going in and out of Bitfinex and identified several distinct patterns that suggest that someone or some people at the exchange successfully worked to push up prices when they sagged at other exchanges. To do that, the person or people used a secondary virtual currency, known as Tether, which was created and sold by the owners of Bitfinex, to buy up those other cryptocurrencies.

“There were obviously tremendous price increases last year, and this paper indicates that manipulation played a large part in those price increases,” Mr. Griffin said.

Bitfinex executives have denied in the past that the exchange was involved in any manipulation. The company said on Wednesday that it had never engaged in “any sort” of market or price manipulation. “Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex,” Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, Bitfinex’s chief executive, said in a statement.

The new paper helped push down the already sinking price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Wednesday. The price of Bitcoin fell as much as 5 percent after the report was published, approaching its lowest point of the year. Bitcoin is now down more than 65 percent from the highs it hit late last year.

The authors of the new 66\-page paper do not have emails or documents that prove that Bitfinex knew about or was responsible for price manipulation. The researchers relied on the millions of transaction records that are captured on the public ledgers of all virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain, to spot patterns. This method is not conclusive, but it has helped government authorities and academics spot suspicious activity in the past.

In particular, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Shams examined the flow of Tether, a token that is supposed to be tied to the value of the dollar and that is issued exclusively by Bitfinex in large batches. They found that half of the increase in Bitcoin’s price in 2017 could be traced to the hours immediately after Tether flowed to a handful of other exchanges, generally when the price was declining.

Other large virtual currencies that can be purchased with Tether, such as Ether and Zcash, rose even more quickly than Bitcoin in those periods. The prices rose much more quickly on exchanges that accepted Tether than they did on those that did not, and the pattern ceased when Bitfinex stopped issuing new Tether this year, the authors found.

Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor at the University College London who pioneered this sort of pattern spotting, said the analysis in the new paper “seems sound” after reviewing it this week.

Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a firm that analyses blockchain data, also said the study “seems credible.” He cautioned that a full understanding of the patterns would require more analysis.

Mr. Griffin previously wrote research pointing to fraudulent behavior in several other financial markets. He drew attention for a 2016 paper that suggested that a popular financial contract tied to the volatility in financial markets, known as the VIX, was being manipulated. A whistle\-blower later came forward to confirm those suspicions, and now several active lawsuits are focused on the allegations.

Beyond his work at the University of Texas, Mr. Griffin has a consulting firm that works on financial fraud cases, including some in the virtual currency industry.

“The relationship between Tether and the price of Bitcoin has been flagged for months within the community,” said Christian Catalini, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in blockchain research. “It is great to see academic work trying to causally assess if market manipulation is taking place.”

The new paper is not the first academic work to identify manipulation in the virtual currency markets. A paper published last year by a team of Israeli and American researchers said much of Bitcoin’s big price increase in 2013 was caused by a campaign of price manipulation at what was then the biggest exchange, Mt. Gox.

china Bitcoin's richest man Xiaolai Li PK FUNCITY Weixing Chen,"The original text of Chen Wei Xing: 

Starting a business is to stick to some bottom line, in the currency circle, at least two things need to understand clearly: the authenticity of investment celebrity platform and the rationality of the use of private funds. This is a necessary process to push the industry forward. About this thing in the currency circle of the big guys have communicated many times, most really rich really want to do things are gradually formed consensus, but Li Yu to the exception, I think I targeted him and turned into a private rumor of personal attacks. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s private equity and Li Yu's scam.

Here are a few facts, and I can bear the corresponding ""burden of proof"".

1. I have communicated with Li xiaolai in private several times how to stop stealing private funds and a large proportion of free money, doing some positive energy things, be ignored;

2. Xu Xiaoping teacher and Hongbo organization ""block chain first Dinner"", we argue can not be stolen private funds and a large proportion of free currency, huff up to no consensus;

3. Li xiaolai began in June 2013 to September, raised 30,000 Bitcoin, and verbally promised that it would be guaranteed by Bitcoin, which expired last September and was requested to be postponed for a year; the next September is the time of maturity; This is the industry old people well\-known things, I did not lie;

4. Li Yu to raise the Bitcoin, into the just\-dice to gamble, one of the accounts, even created the history of Bitcoin the biggest gambler's reputation, these information high level of people can find online;

5. Li Yu exchanges Bigone, INB Capital and fund\-raising accounts are mixed with their personal accounts, and to show people their wealth, fictitious its ""richest Man"" illusion; 6. There is no concept of public money in the concept of Li Yu, the vast majority of his projects have been a large proportion of their own, and a large proportion of the free currency in the two\-tier market cast; most typical when he and OTCBTC Zheng Yiting tear force of the core reason is that Li xiaolai want to take away 40&amp;#37; of the fund\-raising and Zheng think he has no

The right to do so, funny is Li xiaolai also in micro\-Bo scold Zheng Don't speak credit!

7. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s statement that private accounts for 4 billion of dollars are not responsible for anything, it is hoped that without naming the situation can promote the domestic currency of the public funds reasonable use of the consensus, the result became a Li xiaolai group of EOS personnel to attack me personally, so I had to roll the call.

8. I do not have a wallet, do not remember the bank password, although the investment of many exchanges, media, market, wallet, etc., but never let them help me on a currency;

9. Three o'clock the group of several coins, and I have no concern, I was early to help blind people, not and anyone recommended, also think that they should not be over marketing, should do a good job; three o'clock Group of any General Assembly, I did not participate in the organization, my name was stolen is the organizers of the mess; 10. I have no direct conflict of interest with Li Yu, it is a conflict of values, let me in this industry mixed to vomit;

Personally, I have no intention and no need for this hot excrement to provoke the Sao, still need not rely on him to make up for oneself; 11. My plea is clear, that is, hope that the industry bosses can form a ""no corruption"" consensus. If you do, you will never be able to!

Li xiaolai's response to some of Albert Chan's comments:

It was one of those March days, in ""The Three O'Clock Mars founders"", I really can't watch, with Chen Weixing a dialogue. Familiar with my people know, I always cherish the time, because their time is my own life. I want to be kind to myself, so I don't want to spend my time on things that are not worth it.

However, the recent Chen Weixing of all kinds of behavior and speech, let me have to waste a small part of their lives, but also helpless. It's hard not to mix emotions with such a person, such a thing, so, I write down the first title of this text is ""endure nausea seriously respond to Chen Weixing's remarks, with the fact that ... was written down and changed to the present response to some of the comments about Albert Chan, removing the emotional component\-\-at a time like this , it takes a lot of strength to stay calm. If you are not able to control your emotions as a reader, then do not read them down.

Other readers, do not care about what happened in the currency, then do not waste time\-after all, although the lively is someone else's, but life is their own. After reading Chen Weixing's remarks, the uninformed reader feels that this is all a Chen Weixing of the Evil (Li xiaolai) of the struggle for justice.

But this technique is too clumsy.

There was a joke in the previous crosstalk, 逗哏 asked 捧哏:

Are you still hitting your dad? 捧哏 Meng, this word has a trap ah! No matter the answer is not right ah! 捧哏 deeper embarrassment lies in: ""Why do you accuse me of having beaten my father?""

""Obviously this is the trap of 逗哏, but 捧哏 no fight back, because the audience which tube this ah, first own happy to say ...

Although I am not 捧哏, but Albert Chan is using this way to Li Yu to the next set.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After I have made clear the routines, I can not understand the emotional low article to refute: Starting a business is to stick to some bottom line, in the currency circle, at least two things need to understand clearly: the authenticity of investment celebrity platform and the rationality of the use of private funds. This is a necessary process to push the industry forward. About this thing in the currency circle of the big guys have communicated many times, most really rich really want to do things are gradually formed consensus, but Li Yu to the exception, I think I targeted him and turned into a private rumor of personal attacks. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s private equity and Li Yu's scam.

Here are a few facts, and I can bear the corresponding ""burden of proof"". Chen Weixing to the point of labeling, ""entrepreneurship is to stick to some of the bottom line""\-so the intention is to first put the opponent to the ""no bottom line"" position, and then wave the ""Justice of the stick."" Further down, the wording is as follows: Here are a few facts, and I can bear the corresponding ""burden of proof""\-unfortunately, read\-by\-article, there is no fact, there is no evidence.

At this point, the logic of Albert Chan is not qualified, legal knowledge is near the law of illiteracy.

1. I have communicated with Li xiaolai in private several times how to stop stealing private funds and a large proportion of free money, doing some positive energy things, be ignored; Chen Weixing never personally communicated this topic to me in private. The only time we had a separate communication (the presence of his own female assistant) was Albert Chan who came to my office a few days before his birthday to preach his chain of cabs. He had no face at the time, so he was in high spirits ... After listening to him, I smoked several cigarettes.

Then, to give him face, I also went to the Chen Weixing birthday party.

But what is stated in this article of Albert Chan is not a fact, and of course there is no evidence.

2. Xu Xiaoping teacher and Hongbo organization ""block chain first Dinner"", we argue can not be stolen private funds and a large proportion of free currency, huff up to no consensus; Here is a typo, not ""Hongbo"", but Feng Po. There are Xu Mingxing, Lilin, Wu Bogey cold, Shofen, Gao Xi Jin and other people.

All these people can testify: ""We argue that we can't take private equity and a large percentage of free money,"" which is not the subject of debate between me and Mr Albert Chan. The scene is probably what I said: ""You said all right, and no one objected, the question is, do you think there are people who do not understand this reason?"" Does that make any sense to you?

” Chen Weixing want to give people the impression that he is in the name of justice with Li Yu to argue, the result of discord ... Sorry, it's not true.

There are many witnesses at the scene.

3. Li xiaolai began in June 2013 to September, raised 30,000 Bitcoin, and verbally promised that it would be guaranteed by Bitcoin, which expired last September and was requested to be postponed for a year; the next September is the time of maturity; This is the industry old people well\-known things, I did not lie; Once again, this is not true. It was ""equivalent to about 20 million yuan"" of private equity funds. And I never promised to be guaranteed by Bitcoin\-my words were ""hoping to win bitcoin."" As for the expiration of last September, this is cover, it is ""4\+1"", so it is due to expire in September this year.

Oh, yes, according to the current performance, after wrote off a lot of items, it seems to be really run to win Bitcoin\-sorry. So, this one, Chen Weixing want to use ""This is the industry old people well\-known things, I did not lie"" fooled the past\-sorry, he still lied. He did not know the secret, so he was irresponsible. Not only that, Chen Weixing around to say Li Yu to owe others 30,000 Bitcoin, this is simply slander, because this fact does not exist, ""owed"" does not exist, ""30,000 Bitcoin"" is also fictitious. I have reminded him that he has the burden of proof or slander. Mr Albert Chan, who does not understand the law, has so far failed to understand what ""burden of proof"" is, or even, I doubt whether he understands the true meaning of the word ""evidence"".

Otherwise, why so many words written out, even a little evidence can not find?

4. Li Yu to raise the Bitcoin, into the just\-dice to gamble, one of the accounts, even created the history of Bitcoin the biggest gambler's reputation, these information high level of people can find online; This one, it is even more ridiculous. At Xu Xiaoping and Feng Po's dinner, Mr Chen faltered to claim that he had begun to touch and invest in Bitcoin in 2013 years ... I did not bother to expose him on the spot, when the currency circle is very small, who do not know who? In the second half of 2013, I did invest in Just\-dice and was the first investor to invest more than 2,500 bitcoin. Because that was the only project that could have been found at the time with Bitcoin and was likely to get a bit of money, and many old people had invested in Just\-dice. On this point, I have never deliberately hidden, I even in a group dedicated to share the logic of investment just\-dice. And Mr Albert Chan deliberately uses sensational words, said Li Yu to money laundering, gambling, and further, to instruct a media staff to forward to other media, the deliberate use of the term ""drug\-related"", which is very dirty behavior\-and, this really may constitute a crime, libel.

Li xiaolai Theoretically could therefore initiate criminal proceedings.

5. Li Yu exchanges Bigone, INB Capital and fund\-raising accounts are mixed with their personal accounts, and to show people their wealth, fictitious its ""richest Man"" illusion; It's too lazy to refute, but it has to be countered.

Once again, there is absolutely no evidence\-and of course not the truth. Mr Albert Chan is actually a fake entrepreneur, although he has always claimed to be a ""founder of the Fast"", but in fact? What is Lu Zhunwei for? In fact, Albert Chan has never done anything complete. It is well known that Chen Weixing had sold the vast majority of his small, fast\-running shares at a time when the fast valuations were not high.

So, whimsical is his thinking loophole, which is why INB eventually lost the ""taxi chain"" The reason for the project\-we decided not to participate. How many assets does the exchange total manage users he knows? The personal assets I have hosted on the exchange are only a small part of myself, and only a smaller portion of the total assets of the exchange. The team ran the exchange for so many years, never lost any virtual assets, how to do? First of all, Yaozhang clear?

If it could have been ""mixed"" as he had imagined, would a database of thousands of transactions per minute be a mess?

6. Li Yu to the idea that there is no public funds concept, the vast majority of his projects have been a large proportion of their pocket, and a large proportion of the free currency in the two\-tier market cast; The most typical of his and OTCBTC's Zheng Yiting tear force is the core reason is that Li xiaolai want to take 40&amp;#37;

To raise funds and Zheng think that they do not have the right to do so, funny is Li xiaolai also so in micro\-Bo scold Zheng Don't speak credit!

""There is no notion of public money in the idea of Li Yu,"" he said, either by Mr Albert's own imagination or by his deliberate labelling. ""The vast majority of his projects were pocketed by a large percentage of them, and a large percentage of the free currency was thrown in the two\-tier market,"" It was framed and defamatory. If Chen Weixing that this is not slander, then, please come up with the evidence, Li Yu to take the money of which project, a large proportion of the coin? And, this is particularly ridiculous: ""A large proportion of free money in the two\-tier market selling""\-please Chen Weixing to come up with evidence, where I took a percentage of the ""free currency""? As for ""in the two\-tier market selling"", Chen Weixing is really do not know me ah! I am the holder of the currency as far as possible.

This is ridiculous, but I can still be so invited: no proof, but Fan Chenwei Star can point out which item on the Li xiaolai took a lot of free money and then in the two market, I can take out the transaction address record of the token, to everyone to see, I just did not move. But now to Chen Weixing's comrades, to give him advice, ""black material"" Erihua, the Investment Penta project is in the name of INB, back to find that the project may be more profitable, became a ""capital"" of the project\-it is also because the founder of the Penta Project initiated with me,

I have the possibility to disclose things openly. About the Zheng incident, just on the internet there is already a public, she and I recorded the call. ""It's nonsense,"" Li xiaolai wanted to take away 40&amp;#37; of the fundraising and Zheng thought he had no right to do so. My request is that as 40&amp;#37; shareholders, 40&amp;#37; of the rights, have the right to jointly manage all the funds raised\-is this not common sense? Zheng wants to portray Li xiaolai as a ""black\-hearted investor"" in public, so please, Zheng after the project has been profitable, at least the Li Yu to the investment money after the return, okay? Greedy for shareholder rights, go back to Taiwan, refuse to answer the phone, and say ""please communicate with my lawyer"", and that lawyer will never answer the phone ...

This is just ""not credit"" Ah, this is simply a rogue\-Albert Chan If you think Zheng is a comrade, I think it is also a matching.

7. I question [Block.one](https://block.one/)'s statement that private accounts for 4 billion of dollars are not responsible for anything, it is hoped that without naming the situation can promote the domestic currency of the public funds reasonable use of the consensus, the result became a Li xiaolai group of EOS personnel to attack me personally, so I had to roll the call.

It's not true, there's no evidence. ""Li xiaolai a group of EOS personnel to attack me personally"" ... All this time, it's you Chen Weixing attacking Li Yu without a baseline, okay? I am really busy, just invested in a hardware company, we are busy every day to discuss how to make a world's largest artificial intelligence Li Yun; also invested in a team ready to do a shared chain, we open the brain hole, brainstorming, and finally got the conclusion that the core of sharing is people, not people to share the car, bicycles, houses, rechargeable treasure ... So we have to change the team structure ... Chen Weixing in the circle of friends, in micro\-blog slander me, to their own face, I am really not free.

Poor me to care about my friends and family, call to greet me, I had to take care of their emotions, so I have to explain to them the ins and outs of this Chen Weixing, wasting my life! As for the so\-called ""so I have to call the roll"", alas, Albert Chan did not do it two days a day.

I'm just too lazy to spend my time on this kind of thing. This is true: many EOS holders run to tweets and scold Albert Chan. Can be honest, this is Albert Chan to find their own scold. The history of EOS, as new in the circle of Albert Chan, is certainly not fully understood. Do not say this, said the most easy to understand the fact: at this stage, EOS and air, also can not say not to practice the taxi chain more air it? EOS again air, also can not be compared to the XMX, Jade Red make more air? Xmx a large area of the EOS code, unexpectedly still and Chen Wei star to say that the EOS is a MLM, is the air, is also a wonderful flower. Don't say, xmx I am also an investor, because Zhaodong Dfund said to return my personal feeling, with them the same condition, so, I invested in the personal name eth\-\-now look back, thanks Ah! From the very beginning, I said I can't advertise with my name.

It's almost the only time I've ever taken the initiative to avoid a pit in the currency circle.

8. I do not have a wallet, do not remember the bank password, although the investment of many exchanges, media, market, wallet, etc., but never let them help me on a currency; This one has nothing to do with me, there is no need to refute, although there is no evidence.

Anyway, if you say so, I'll just listen.

9. Three o'clock the group of several coins, and I have no concern, I was early to help blind people, not and anyone recommended, also think that they should not be over marketing, should do a good job; three o'clock Group of any General Assembly, I did not participate in the organization, my name was stolen is the organizers of the mess; This one has nothing to do with me again. Li Yu to invest in a project, called eos\-\-a good project? It's not air, is it? The air currency is impossible to have original code! \-and then, by Chen Weixing accused of ""no public asset consciousness"" and so on ...

At the expense of slander. Then, Albert Chan cast a project of his own, xmx, that is really the air ah! The white paper copied my investment from another project, was I quietly advised, not willing to direct public anger to the end even the code is copied EOS, this is not air?! This is not what Mr Albert Chan called a leek? I go to his place, do not mention ""public assets"", I do not mention ""public transparency""? However, Chen Weixing to himself is very tolerant: ""I am a blind vote"", and then a word with the finished son? Do not know have Wang Weixing, Sun Weixing, Yang Wei star what's to frontline frontline him?

Now I want to get rid of my relationship with ""three o'clock""\-who was in the middle of the night in the Three o'clock crowd?

10. I do not have any personal direct conflict of interest with Li Yu, it is a conflict of values, let me in this industry to vomit, I personally do not have the will and no need to rub this hot excrement to provoke Sao, don't need to rely on him to make up for himself; ""I don't have any personal direct conflict of interest with Li Yu""\-\-I thought so, and now a little unsure. ""Conflict of Values""? Agree.

The values of Li xiaolai and Chen Weixing are indeed different. 11. My plea is clear, that is, hope that the industry bosses can form a ""no corruption"" consensus.

If you do, you will never be able to! Please Mr Albert Chan to seek truth from facts: ""No corruption"" consensus, do not need Chen Weixing advocacy, this is common sense, any normal person should do things.

Mr Albert Chan refers to Li xiaolai corruption, but does not provide evidence, this is slander. What do you mean, principled? Just one example. Cloud currency, before the shutdown, is even the virtual currency handling fee income is converted into the day of the renminbi calculation, and then paid in full tax. This, anyone can go to Beijing Haidian Tax Bureau to verify. That's the kind of team I trust. This is called a principle, the principle is to stick to their own, not used to shout, nor do they can not do it everywhere to ask others. I guess: This team is theoretically probably one of the very few (or even the only) people on Earth so far.

Active and fully taxable virtual asset Exchange? For the past two months, I have been very confused about one thing. Because there is another person, the founder of a certain media, was waved as a gun by Chen Wei Star. This man used her pen to save a friend of mine and is now a partner. So, after understanding the ins and outs, I am very strange, this is obviously once a ""messenger of Justice"", how to become this way? Just because Chen Weixing was her investor, she completely lost her ability to discriminate? As a senior media person, do not have the most basic training? Should ""the word have basis"" be regarded as the most basic principle and the bottom line of the word? Even try to communicate face\-to\-face, no fruit.

The mouth is full of sounding words, secretly doing all the things without the bottom line. I don't know if I guessed right, she's the same person as Chen Weixing, they are not ""the embodiment of righteousness"", they are not ""messengers of righteousness"", they are just ""people who use justice as a tool for self\-interest""\-\-even if it is irrelevant to facts, principles, or even the bottom line, any ""justice"" can be waved as a stick if it can achieve a goal.",1528985873,14/06/2018 14:17:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8r278l/china_bitcoins_richest_man_xiaolai_li_pk_funcity/,1

Remember that people will be forced to adopt Bitcoin,"As central banks unwind QE, nations which were already in a weak position will start to inflate very rapidly. Im talking about the devleoping economies. All of them are usually very corrupt and do not have people in power that put the interests of the citizens first.

Bitcoin might continue going down in value, but when your currency starts losing 40% every year like Argentina, Bitcoin wont seem like a crazy choice.

Also keep in mind that its incredibly difficult to buy dollars/euros in most countries. A lot of them have many barriers to the amount you can purchase daily/weekly/monthly/yearly, and they also carry a huge premium. This is also just viable for the upper class because everyone else has no idea of how to bank or even have a bank.

If you live in a strong country like the US, China, Japan, Germany etc., chances are you wont need Bitcoin any time soon, but when half the world starts dropping their shitty currencies you will need to adopt BTC to keep the commerce going.

And just like we couldnt imagine what the internet/tech would bring us 20 years ago, we have no idea of how crazy the world will be in the next 20.

Shorting Bitcoin,"Generally, you short an asset for two reasons: to speculate or to hedge on what you believe to be an overvalued asset.

If this were a rational market, following a linear trend, the price of Bitcoin today would be somewhere in the range of 10-15k. Shorting Bitcoin at 18k, 15k, 12k, 10k, or even 8k during Q1/Q2 2018, I get. But shorting Bitcoin at 8k, 6k, or even 4k during Q3 2018, I don't get.

If you believe in the long term vision of Bitcoin, you see the value and understand why, $6k, as of June 2018, a nearly 70% correction, is no longer an overvalued asset.

Personally, I don't trade BTC, I accumulate during corrections. I welcome the cheaper prices but trying to drive the price down by shorting, in order to accumulate more BTC, at the expense of your fellow margin longs is, at best, futile, at worst, a sadist and narcissistic effort.",1528999331,14/06/2018 18:02:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8r40ao/shorting_bitcoin/,1

Shorting VS Holding market manipulation.,"I see lots of manipulation here. So I decided to post my opinion. 
Holders and shorters are the two sides of a coin. Both are market manipulations. Holders are making markets less liquidity. They drives the price up, by making supply less. What is the purpose of holding? To buy Lambo and live a rockstar life? Don’t tell me that you won’t sell when it gets 20k let’s say. I don’t believe. 
Shorting is obvious. The same reason behind the scenes. But less less lies. 

What is the purpose of the “free money”? To be used as day to day life. 
Don’t you see, both are driving away the merchants, the buyers. 
History is that this strategies are patented by banks. And later they will state that we were warned this is a bubble. And will offer to use their “fair fiat”. 

Please correct if I am wrong. But I see that there are greedy people everywhere and gives a bad name to good ideas. They just wants to discredit it. They manipulate the price. You need both holders and shorters in order to make it l as stable as a way to avoid mass adoption.

Don't buy bitcoin unless you read ....,"Bitcoin's epic rise last year may have been more than investor fervor. A study published Wednesday says at least half of the jump in **bitcoin** was due to **coordinated price manipulation**.

University of Texas finance professor John Griffin, who has a 10-year track record of spotting financial fraud, and graduate student Amin Shams examined millions of transactions on cryptocurrency exchange **Bitfinex**. In a 66-page paper, the authors found that **tether** was used to buy bitcoin at key moments when it was declining, which helped ""stabilize and manipulate"" the cryptocurrency's price.

""Fraud and manipulation often leave footprints in the data and it's nice to have the blockchain to track things,"" Griffin told.
It sounds just like it was 2008 ""pump and dump"" strategy all over again.

Bitcoin lightning - ease of use and how channels work,"Hi all,

Hoping there are plans to make LN as easy as possible for newcomers looking to use BTC in the future. Even I am a bit confused about 'payment channels'. I really wish LN could operate in a wallet without even mentioning payment channels.

Is it possible for a wallet to automatically handle the opening and closing of payment channels behind the scenes? Bit hard to get mass adoption if we have to explain to ppl how to open a channel, send payment, pay for channel, close channel etc. 

It's early days with LN but hoping someone more experienced can chime in here. I think opening a channel costs BTC right? Again, how much does this cost and can it be handled by a wallet automatically?",1529035746,15/06/2018 04:09:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8r84fl/bitcoin_lightning_ease_of_use_and_how_channels/,1

Tokenizers,"I was reading a tweet today from a known person who wants to tokenize everything. During the tweet storm it puzzled him at what the value of btc would have to be a the world’s currency. If the world’s assets, debts, and derivatives are equal to $900T that means each btc has to be worth $50 million. But his thought is wrong. The world doesn’t have $900T in currency. The world has about $90T in currency. The rest is covered under the unit of account property of money. 

I advise most of you who read this to be careful at those who are Blockchain, tokenizers, smart contractors and the sort. They are all trying to say they are better than bitcoin. But they all have fundamental flaws at what bitcoin is set out for. The end result we want for bitcoin is not just a medium of exchange. Nor is it a means of exchange. (Fast transactions) It is to become a unit of account. 

For those who are reading this and also invest in multiple projects. Understand this. Bitcoin is being developed to be a unit of account to replace or run in parallel with other units of accounts. ($,€,£,¥) We are not competing with Visa. We are not competing with Facebook or Google. We are not competing with ETH, BCH, or whatever altcoin. We are competing to become a world reserve currency. The tech is important but so is the monetary issue. No other project is focused on this. They have founders with coin rewards or premines. No nation state is ever going to allow a developer or founder of a coin or token ever reach the point of unit of account.

Could Bitcoin be a Deep State PsyOp? I think I may have a subtle clue...,"https://gopreload.org/pentagon-kills-lifelog-project-same-day-facebook-founded

I don't think any of us are shy to the Deep State and Conspiracy theories.  But in the Link above, it states that DARPA's life Log program was cancelled the day Facebook was founded. If we connect the dots, we can conclude, facebook is most likely a continuation of DARPA's program. 

So if its a sham and Zuckerberg is more of a figure head and fake founder, then the whole story with the Winklevoss twins might be bull shit too. 

What are you gonna believe ""more"", some nerd starts a multi billion international by himself/with friends. 

Or what about, if he kind of stole the idea from some kids at harvard, and there was this law suit and you know its totally real. 

(I bet harvard has some kind of version of skull and bones society) 

SO. If facebook is more or less bullshit, then the winklevoss have to be also. Is Bitcoin their payment, along with the lawsuit to play along? 'Here is a large piece of the new economy in the coming years. stfu and play along' 

And I've always found it weird how the US protects its citizens from across border scams, which is why its so hard for US citizens to be part of many exchanges, but the US gov't has been so lenient on Bitcoin. Yeah they do these smoke shows where they pretend to be mean to Bitcoin, but they are letting it happen. And Its all over wall street with Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, Digital Currency Group and so on. 

I'm not saying its bad. I'm just saying this might not be so grassroots as we think. ",1529043175,15/06/2018 06:12:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8r8r7n/could_bitcoin_be_a_deep_state_psyop_i_think_i_may/,1

"Big stores without escrow or multisig give a false sense of security, support stores that use escrow.","It was great to see large companies like Overstock, Expedia and others to start accepting bitcoin. Now its time for the next step. Multi sig has been around for a while, and can be used with a 3rd party arbitrator. Traditionally credit cards will act as an arbitrator, think of credit cards as having 180 day escrow, the time limit for chargebacks.

most big companies use bp, and bp does some vetting to make sure the company provides good service. but bp still expects you to send direct.

while they companies are trust worthy, and will correct issues with product quality, they are getting people comfortable with sending direct, with no form of protection. new users who are just getting started have no awareness of the issue.

Many people like to support smaller businesses. and there are lots of great small businesses out there that will do everything they can to provide good products/services. But there are many fake small business scammers out there. Escrow can protect against this.

Sites big and small could get hacked, users could end up on the wrong site, and blindly send btc to the wrong address. and arbitrator might catch this.

arbitration is not perfect and can also have issues, or an arbitrator could be a scammer. Its important that arbitration be decentralized, not just one big company like bp, but lots of individuals.

When the consumer losses out due to scams the consumer is a direct victim. but it also hurts the bitcoin community, giving a bad image, and good businesses end up with customer base that has less money to put towards the good businesses that deserve it.

There are a few ways to go about using escrow with multisig. The first is direct wallets, with manual setup. Electrum and bp wallets are wallets that support multisig. the most popular way would be a 2 of 3 wallet. where 2 signers out of 3 people are needed to finalize a transaction. if everything goes well the buyer and seller are involved. if there is an issue the arbitrator will review evidence, and side with one or the other. Manual also allows for upto 10 signers) The other ways are a more automated way of doing the same thing. Bitrated is one of them. the buyer will select someone they will be buying off, and an arbitrator. it also allows you to link social media, and has a rating system based on your social media following/reputation, and your trades on platform. The other popular place is OpenBazaar. In OpenBazaar2 anyone can be an arbitrator, there is also a verified moderator, that has been checked by the OpenBazaar team to be a good bitcoin community member. also unmentionables can be used in OpenBazaar2. Bithalo is similar to openbazaar but with double escrow, this gives both buyer and seller more incentive to be serious and honest. I meant to play with it more, but i was inspired to start writing and get this out.

Bisq is an exchange, one of the only ones where you have the keys. currently the developer serves as the arbitrator, but hopefully in future releases it will be opened up to members of the community. Bisq is software that runs on mac/win/linux for exchanging fiat to/from btc or btc to/from unmentionables. All other exchanges you don't have the keys, and should not be trusted as much as people do. Binance is looking to become more like bisq, but currently binance is centralized and has the key. as far as I know, no other exchange is working towards this for bitcoin. there are some other decentralized exchanges- I'll leave this out, auto mod picked out some stuff.

Manual Multisig is good for private, and one time use, or long term agreements where the wallets can be left active. Bitrated is good for checking reputation, and setting one time offers. OpenBazaar is good for the seller to list items for sale. The seller will choose various acceptable arbitrators, and from that list the buyer can choose an arbitrator. Have a significant number of arbitrators to choose from (manual may be difficult to find).

An additional advantage to utilizing multisig for bitcoin enthusiasts is more people will be hodling potentially for a few hours, days or even month. This can drive the btc price up.

an additional issue, especially for projects that may take weeks or months is price volatility. you'll have to agree on if you are strictly priced in btc, or if you are using a fiat exchange rate at the start of the transaction, or at the end of the transaction. or you might give the option to be whatever is more advantages to the business or customer.

This opens up some spaces for new companies to become arbitrators, and certain people may like a well established arbitrator, while others might like the small individual arbitrator. Anyone of the parties could even set themselves up to hedge the exchange rate to make more interesting offers.

I would hope that those who are true believers will start using escrow soon, and get people in the habit of transacting safely. Overstock seems to be a bitcoin ally so I hope to see them start sooner. Expedia seems like they just care about customer demand and the profit, so I don't expect as much from. There are many other examples, I just didn't want to spend the time to go through everything. There's lots of people already on bitrated, and openbazaar, that maybe need a little reminder, just how important their part is in escrow, and keeping the bitcoin community strong

Full Nodes vs a Mining node running a full Node,"Trying to understand the difference between Full Nodes vs a Mining node running a full Node.
 
Here is my understanding:

Miners adds txs to a block, so it needs to make sure the tx's are legit (no double spend). That is why each mining node should run a full node, so it has a copy of the blockchain to check the ledger. 

Now once the POW is done (nonce+extra nonce is guessed), and a block is mined, this block is send to Full nodes for consensus. 

Then the TXs are verified against the ledger and  the info is propagated across the network.

From my understanding Mining full node does two jobs 1. Mining and 2. Consensus (maintain ledger).  //lets just consider full nodes, and not go into pruned/spv etc.

Full Node does just once: Consensus. 

So both nodes are needed from where I see. 
But why on twitter, mutiple people say ""If you are not running mining node with a full node, your full node is useless""?

I was cheated on bitcoins by the reddit user,"
Hey
One user on the reddit cheated me for $ 30 in bitccoins that doubled this amount twice, he guaranteed that I would receive my money - he had 14k karma so I believed him. I have depression, problems at home and at school so I could easily get fucked. I know that this is a funny amount for you but I wanted to invest some of it in the knowledge and the rest to invest CONFIDENCE on the matches of the national team during the World Cup.
I analyze bets from subreddita sportsbook, soccerbetting and I always won. I know what the risk is and I do it very carefully, I do not invest the whole amount but I know what to put on. I go to school and work in odd jobs but I miss it for household payments (I'm not doing well at home). Later, I wanted to invest in Dascoin. I know that it can work, but it is different than what the user offered. The day after I bitcoin him, he wrote to me that he suddenly burned the hard disk and I will not get my bitcoins back :( What can I do to get my money back?",1529054603,15/06/2018 09:23:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8r9m36/i_was_cheated_on_bitcoins_by_the_reddit_user/,1

Have you heard about Trailing Stop Loss order?,"I stumbled upon this not long ago and it got my attention. What are your thoughts?

Unique Trailing Stop Loss order by CoinPulse Exchange: 

A Revolution Step towards Stop Loss Pricing! This a powerful, hard-to-find feature which allows users to set a stop order that will be automatically adjusted each time the asset moves 20&amp;#37; upward from the price it was started at. There will be a standard stop loss with an optional checkbox that will trigger the Trailing Stop Loss feature, for e.g. if you want to sell an asset only if it goes down 10&amp;#37; from the current price, you set a regular Stop Loss Limit as such. When you check the Trailing Stop Loss option, the order will execute as usual at the price you set it if the asset then goes down to that 10&amp;#37; threshold, but if the asset’s price first goes up by 20&amp;#37;, the Stop Limit will also go up by 20&amp;#37; from the original stop loss limit you set. Each time the asset goes up by 20&amp;#37; increments, your sell price protection (Stop Limit) also goes up by 20&amp;#37;, thereby letting you automatically take advantage of the asset moving in your favor without having to readjust the Stop Limit to benefit from the overall increase in the asset price. The Trailing Stop Loss option, denoted by “i”, will be placed beside the Stop Loss option. Traders will have to “check” it in order to avail the benefit of automatic stop loss trailing. The stop loss price will keep increasing in 20&amp;#37; increments at every 20&amp;#37; increase in the original asset price. The Trailing Stop Loss, once updated by the system (i.e. when 20&amp;#37; increase is registered), will change only upwards at every 20&amp;#37; increment based on the asset’s price. It will never go downwards unless the user cancels the stop loss order. Note: Trailing Stop Loss will work in Sats and not in $ value. Users must set their trade values based on prices in Sats (1 Sat is the lowest fraction of BTC).

"""Money just wants to be one""","Since when has 200 different national currencies been good for global trade, forex risk, fair global competition between businesses etc. 

How efficient is a business when you need to waste time and resources dedicating effort to following the forex market instead of focusing on your product. What if you dedicate 30 years to building a competative advantage only to see that advantage wiped out in 1 month because your nations currency rises against other currencies.

The whole point of inventing ""money"" was to do away with barter because barter is inefficient. In fact the ""invention"" of money was just people deciding to use one single store of value for trade within a community to maximize efficiency of trade instead of using many different mediums (barter).

We now live in one globalized community so we should logically use one globalized currency to make trade more efficient and fair.

When you think about it we literally have a system of inefficient barter today trying to trade global currencies with eachother. Forex is currency barter!

""Money just wants to be one"" - Saifedean Ammous

Even over the last 50 years we saw the world trending towards a system of one global reserve currency (USD) where it was permitted. Not that it will last because it gives one countries government the ability to export inflation to the detriment of other countries economies, which will not last over the long term. Infact the USD is crumbling as we speak because it gives advantage to the US over other countries. 

We need a politically neutral global currency not controlled by any one government.

Bitcoin will be the one global store of value used as money, all other cryptos will be pay-per-use, where if you want to use a dapp for example your smart wallet ""atomically"" swaps into other cryptos by the second to pay for it.

It is fine to have one global currency when that currency is politically neutral and not forced on the world but is instead voluntarily adopted. Infact it is the only logically way forward for humanity.",1529058310,15/06/2018 10:25:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8r9wby/money_just_wants_to_be_one/,1

It's the first time in history a graduate paper wiped billions from an asset..,"That's how crazy cryptospace is..

So let's take things from the start. There is one academic paper written by a graduate student under the supervision of his professor. We all know what that means. Hungry for drama media take up the article and post it (NY times). Regardless of whether it's true or false, one could use this as a major manipulation. If you know this article is being printed and you know how the immature market overreacts it's prime shorting time. What an irony when posting an article about manipulator...you are the manipulator.

In any case, there was another article here [http://www.tetherreport.com/](http://www.tetherreport.com/) that finds absolutely no correlation with prices increases. Why should I believe a graduate student vs someone else that conducted statistical analysis? Well, we collectively panicked on one article and totally dismissed the other one.

Why? Economic theory always suggests that negative news have more power than positive ones as we have seen during the last months, we have a super influx of positive news to which the market does not react.

Still, my thoughts about Tether are summed up from this series of Tweets from someone I respect:[https://twitter.com/matt\_odell/status/1006885981797208064](https://twitter.com/matt_odell/status/1006885981797208064)

He has a nice wording but I also need to add a couple of things I keep repeating.

1. ALL of the exchanges that use Tether do not seem to be worried. Either they are STUPID or they are convinced that there is no immediate threat from Tether. Conspiracy zionists will say that they are all in this together. Well I'm not a flat earther on this one.
2. Can you think of one promiment crypto famous person that publicly said he is worried about Tether? I am not talking about Twitter OGs I am talking about Binance CEO for example who seems completely confident Tether is not a scam since he offered insurance in case something happens or other exchange CEOs etc? NONE
3. Tether on purpose does not want to get public with the bank accounts since many governments may start picking on them. It serves a very convenient purpose to the ecosystem.
4. Tether guys have a big vested interest in Bitcoin not failing, they are already gazzillionaires and have no reason to scam. If you have hundreds of millions already, would you run a scam to get some more threatening imprisonment? I wouldn't.
5. Tether has a confirmed bank account with the biggest Dutch bank. Do you think one of the most scrutinizing banks under EU legislation would host billions of a scam scheme?
6. Few understand that you need to increase and decrease the supply of a pegged asset. They just mindlessly repeat ""tether printer"" like an army of tools without understanding what is it's purpose while it is described in their technical documentation.
7. We have more stable coins now in case I am wrong. Can you just chill?

p.s I don't work for Tether, I am not a paid shill etc etc. I am just trying to put my 2 cents to make this market more efficient (because I am a long term investor that profits from rationality vs day traders that profit from madness). So no, this post is not completely altruistic obviously.",1529069799,15/06/2018 13:36:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8razpl/its_the_first_time_in_history_a_graduate_paper/,1

How to recover bitcoins from a cheater,"
I know that I am an idiot that I was fooled, but I described everything below, so please do not down time and make fun of me because I wanted to invest this money and make dreams come true and ....
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
 Hello It's me again. In short, I was cheated by @Zeredder. He guaranteed that he would double my bitcoins using bots and algorithms on the stock exchange. He used the fact that I have depression and problems at home and at school and I let myself be fucked. It was a small and ridiculous amount (30$), but I invested this money in bookmaker's and I also wanted to spend on learning programming - education. I am very careful, I'm betting with types from subreddits  ""sportsbook"" and ""soccerbetting"" so I always manage to win. In addition, I know when to stop and how much to bet. Later I wanted to invest the money in Dascoin, here I know that there is a risk but he did not have the right to appropriate them if he guaranteed that I would receive money.I work in odd jobs but it's hard to get along at home and I wanted to make my dreams come true. And a few hours after I sent him bitcoins, he wrote that he had burned his equipment and now he says nothing. But he really did not have the right to appropriate them, just say how GUARANTEED and ""fooled"" .. I got fucked, I do not know - I would never have a conscience to rob someone, in case what money would be very important for him to leave from losing, for education :(


I know, I got a lesson, but how can I get it back? Now nothing is written off and this amount really means a lot to me, even if I want to invest in knowledge. I'm not rich and you do not know my current situation, so it's hard to understand that it's a lot for me.

From eToro to GDAX for cryptos,"Hi, all. I started some time ago to trade stocks and forex with eToro but somehow I get caught in the cryptocurrencies world. I did some trades in eToro with bitcoin and ethereum and, so far, everything has been ok.

The problem is that, as you know, you can't access  your tokens in eToro. No private keys, no recovery phrase, nothing. Just buy and sell in $. I like trading but I would like also to move my tokens to some wallet and hodl. 

So I discovered GDAX.  I can trade there but it also gives me control over my tokens so I can move them to some wallet if I want. 

So, please, tell me if this makes sense: I plan, in the short term, to stop all my crypto trading in eToro and move my crypto trading to GDAX. I will keep eToro for stocks and the like and use GDAX for cryptos but also for moving my assets to wallets whenever I want. Does all this make sense to you or am I missing something?

Yes, I've heard that eToro plans to provide wallets in the short term but, who knows when? Also, they are famous for charging huge feeds!

Thanks. ",1529087263,15/06/2018 18:27:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rd7e3/from_etoro_to_gdax_for_cryptos/,1

Question about Bitcoin being deleted (I didn't delete my bitcoin) and how it effects the whole system.,"If there is a limited number of bitcoin available, and they were stored on old hard drives and flash drives that have been lost, what does that mean for the system in general? 

I think the number right now is 21 million coins will be in circulation and that's it. 

What if someone mined a bunch in the early years and ended up losing them? Are the lost coins really lost, bringing down the number of coins in circulation?",1529088836,15/06/2018 18:53:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rdekc/question_about_bitcoin_being_deleted_i_didnt/,1

I'm writting at the moment my bachelor thesis and trying to describe when and why the Bitcoin price went significantly up or down.

Supply and Demand Determines Value..Right?,"So, just some thoughts recently about the price manipulation theories.  I mean if more and more people are learning the difference between bitcoin and fiat and are entering BTC as HODLers, then from every side I see it their ability to manipulate the price is very limited.  Especially if people are coming into BTC and moving their coins off exchanges and into cold storage solutions.   I've heard a lot of theories about how bitcoin futures have been a huge reason for why the price has declined and the only way I can see a correlation here would be if people are buying OTC BTC, shorting it, then dumping it on the regular exchanges and collecting the profits.  Unless they are the banks / vested fiat interests, then I don't see exactly why they would do this as I would think any investor in this area would see the potential for bitcoin to be a superior MOE, SOV, and UOA in the not too distant future and go long. If it its manipulation via futures and OTC shorting by the banks, then I can't see why they would choose this approach as these coins are sold on open markets and more and more people are scooping them up daily. Any thoughts or comments are appreciated. ",1529105641,15/06/2018 23:34:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rfdly/supply_and_demand_determines_valueright/,1

So the government.,"Alright guys, here is the deal. I beileve that the American government would never allow the power of money to be taken away from them. So could they of created Bitcoin?

My opinion on Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash,"Listen. I don’t care if you prefer Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. Personally, I’m a fan of Bitcoin, but that’s irrelevant. But please, don’t call Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin. It isn’t. This only confuses newcomers and makes it look like we’re having childish fights. Come on. Keep Bitcoin as BTC, and Bitcoin Cash as BCH. It’s what is generally agreed upon.

It doesn’t help anyone’s argument when you are so confrontational. If you believe what you’re saying, say why.

If you believe that BCH is Satoshi’s true vision, that’s ok. You are entitled to your opinion. I have no problem with that. 

But if you are referring to Bitcoin Cash, don’t call it Bitcoin. Don’t use the BTC ticker. It’s not.

SUCCESSFUL CONTACT MADE! MEPA IS REAL! AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDED. ABRIDGED TRANSCRIPT BELOW.

""...most people found the change traumatic, the millennials fared best as they had little to begin with and adapted best to the new system. Older people with pensions and people who had become dependent on the state fared the worse, but generally except for the few who has made preparations life became much harder. 

 
The collapse began in early September 2018. Deutchbank was the first to go, after the ECB refused to guarantee its obligations to other banks, shortly after Barclays, HSBC and Santander. The contagion spread and eventually all banks, even Goldman Sachs collapsed too. The IMF and World Bank were overwhelmed, nothing could be done. Afterwards the true extent of their criminality became apparent. Many of the assets they said they had did not exist or been stolen and what assets they did have  were now worthless as the buyers (other banks) had all gone bankrupt too. Many bankers disappeared, lots were arrested and quite a few killed themselves.


Throughout the world governments had guaranteed most peoples savings, it very quickly became apparent that due to the size of the collapse this would not be possible. Instead the government issued savers with 'peoples saver bonds' which were to be held for 5 years and paid 8% interest. Initially these bonds traded at a premium due to the -2.5% interest rate set by the Bank Of England. However since the collapse most businesses  had closed and the economy was entirely government driven. Huge sums of money were created with the aim of kick starting the economy back to life. Inflation began to creep in, 10% then 20%, the peoples saver bonds began to trade at a discount 99p to the pound, 95p to the pound. Eventually as inflation hit 500% they were worthless. The government tried to stop inflation by reducing the supply of physical cash, first £50 note were no longer legal tender, then new £10 and £20 notes where issued with the old ones no longer to be used. This had the opposite effect, people no longer trusted that their cash had value so spent it as quick as possible driving up prices even more. Inflation peaked at 630% but by then the damage had been done. Throughout the world all government issued fiat was no longer trusted or accepted.


As the old currencies died so did the power once held by the governments that issued them, the USA fared the worse, no longer able to afford its armies it became a irrelevance. All countries suffered however those with natural resources, gold or crypto-reserves fared the best. 


In September as the collapse was underway attention turned to Bitcoin, they idea of being able to transfer value from A to B without the need for trusting a 3rd party i.e. a bank brought in many large businesses. Also a growing number of people whilst wary and skeptical of using bitcoin thought that their money would be safer in bitcoin than in a bank or held in cash. As the price of bitcoin became more and more expensive the trust in cash diminished. By December bitcoin was now over £1M, it could have been £10M or £100M, even £1B it was irrelevant now. As people frantically converted their life savings from pounds to Bitcoin, receiving a few thousand Satoshi's, the old system was now all but dead.


In a last ditch attempt to keep hold of some kind of power governements begain to mine Bitcoin. For many people reality hit home to how severe the situation had become when during the winter of 2018 the country had rolling blackouts as power was diverted to mining operations. Many people died during a particualrly harsh cold snap around Christmas. Whilst the government did mange to mine some bitcoin it too little too late.

Do Tether control the peg of USDT by printing more when demand is high? Or is the peg set by market faith? Please help me settle this once and for all!,"Many people seem to think that Tether control the price of USDT by printing more if demand on the exchanges goes up, and burning it when demand goes down.        

     
This is quite clearly wrong in my opinion. The price of Tether is effectively pegged by the way they sell it for $1, and promise to buy it back for $1. The market has faith in this promise and therefore values it at around $1. It is not a true peg, but it is effectively pegged due to market faith.         
    
I have argued this point with people many times but it just goes round in circles, they usually give up as they cannot provide any proof, logic or reasoning as to why they are right, but their opinion remains unchanged and so they continue spreading it around the forums.          

I am hoping that this thread can settle this in peoples minds once and for all, as it is important to realise that the USDT peg is purely a psychological one that rests on Tethers promise of buying it back. Without that, USDT is free-floating.          
Please provide some constructive debate below so we can settle this as a community and stop the spread of misinformation!

How I explained Bitcoin to a child,"This is how I explained to my 10 year old niece how Bitcoin increases in value...

""Imagine a big lake that has 21 million magic sponges floating on it. The water in the lake is all the money in the world, and each sponge is a Bitcoin. 
Each of the sponges slowly starts to soak up the water in the lake, but  world governments are constantly pouring more water into the lake, so as the sponges soak up more water, the level of the water in the lake doesn't really drop. The sponges aren't controlled by any government and no more of them can be put into the lake the way the government keeps adding more water. 
These are magic sponges because they can keep getting bigger and bigger, soaking up more and more water and can never get full. 
Eventually people realise that it makes more sense to own a sponge than the water, as they will  get more water that way as long as the sponges keep growing. When millions of people around the world start buying the sponges, they go up in value because there is only 21 million of them for everyone. But there's not enough sponges for every person in the world. As these are magic sponges, each sponge is actually made up of 100,000,000 tiny sponges. So if you're one of the lucky few who owns a full sponge, or even lots of the tiny ones, you can sell them to other people for their water or swap them for a house, car or anything else. The longer you keep your sponge, and as more people want them, you will be able to buy even more stuff. Eventually people won't want to sell their sponges for water anymore, and will want to use them just to buy houses and other stuff. 
The government probably won't be happy with this, as they want people to use the water which they control, and not the sponges which they dont control. They might try to scare people to get them to sell their sponges and stop using the sponges to buy stuff. Some people will be scared, but it will be very difficult to stop everyone using them. 
At some stage, the government will realise that nobody wants to use the water anymore because the sponges are better and they might decide to stop pouring more water into the lake. 
If this happens, the lake won't have any more water in it, and will just be a dry lake full of huge sponges. The people who started buying the sponges first when they were really small were able to buy the most amount of sponges. The bigger they get, the more expensive they get and that means most people will only be able to afford a small amount of the tiny sponges."" 

It might sound like a load of nonsense but my niece now has a good understanding of Bitcoin in a way that she can relate too. She already wants Bitcoin for her birthday.

"Coinbase abandons Bitcoin principles, bans accounts it doesn't like","Bitcoin is an open ecosystem, and open protocol, meant to free people and their money.

Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange, just gave Bitcoin's openness a giant middle finger by banning Gab, the free speech social network, from their platform.

Bitcoin is supposed to be anti-censorship.  But it can't be that if the on-ramps into Bitcoin are controlled by biased gatekeepers who ban people they don't like.

And worse yet, they're setting a precedent that other bitcoin businesses may follow.  How long until you get banned?

If you agree this is a dangerous precedent to set, contact @coinbase on Twitter and let them know won't be using them unless they reinstate Gab's account.

Cost to mine one $BTC,"So everyone seems to be shouting about how $BTC won't break $6000 due to it essentially costing $6000 to mine a single bitcoin on average.  


This is from the average price I believe around the world. But surely this argument can't stand as every miner currently mining in a country let's say where it costs $7000 to mine a bitcoin will just stop mining $BTC and/or switch currencies due to it not being profitable.  


Am I missing something here? Surely, this isn't an argument for bitcoin to stay above 6000.

"Billionaire Investor Explains Why Bitcoin Price Will Hit $250,000 by 2022","He is delusional... 

Billionaire venture capitalist and investor Tim Draper has long been one of cryptocurrency’s biggest bulls, and that has not changed during the first half of 2018, even as the bitcoin price has sunk more than 67 percent from its all-time high.

Draper, as CCN reported, has predicted that the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by 2022, a far cry from the estimated $650 per coin that he paid in 2014 when he won nearly 30,000 BTC from the US Marshals Service in the famous Silk Road auction.

Speaking with financial publication TheStreet, Draper said that the recent market downturn has not caused his confidence in that forecast to waver.

“Price-wise, we’ll continue to see Bitcoin move higher. I’ve revised my estimate up to $250,000 four years out, so we’ll see Bitcoin trade around the $250,000 mark in 2022.”

Draper said that he is basing this bet on the expectation that cryptocurrencies — he’s invested in more than just bitcoin — will “increase the velocity of money” such that the global currency market will hit $140 trillion within the next decade.

“I expect that since cryptocurrencies will increase the velocity of money, the current $86 trillion global market for currency will grow to be about $140 trillion in the next 10 years, and that growth will be in crypto. In fact, I estimate that fiat currencies will actually decrease in use, and that crypto will become as much as $100 trillion of that market. I expect Bitcoin to be about 10% of that market, or $10 trillion. There is a lot of room to grow there.”",1529201522,17/06/2018 02:12:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ro1rr/billionaire_investor_explains_why_bitcoin_price/,1

"I lost £8 transferring from Copay wallet to Bread wallet. I'm not complaining, just curious to know what happened","Hi, I had a small wallet with £8 to experiment and one day I decided to try Bread wallet to test it out. These are the steps I did

1. I tried to experiment with my Copay seed and see if it will import my £8 to Bread. Didn't worked just showed £0
2. On Bread went to ""Unlink my device"" to create a new wallet with a new seed
3. Sent £8 to Bread newly created wallet from Copay, selected the option Economic fee. I just copied the address from Bread to Copay
4. **Copay transferred the money** but until this day I haven't received the money to my Bread wallet

Things I've tried:

* Typed my Copay seed on Electrum and it shows the confirmed transfer
* Typed my Bread seed on Electrum and £0 
* Tried to reinstall Bread and restore the previous seed

I only have those 2 seeds, my phone is not rooted or something and I'm not trying to recover the £8 I'm just confused and I want what happened and look for your opinion

The Winklevoss twins claim one of the biggest arrangement of [**Bitcoin**](https://satoshiuncle.com/what-is-the-real-value-of-bitcoin/) on the planet—and late surges in the computerized cash’s esteem have put the estimation of that portfolio at over $1 billion.

Can this be true ? A bitcoin scam ?,"So last night I went outside with my friends and we had to meet with someone else`s friends , long story short , a dude told me that bitcoin may be the biggest scam in history , I told him why , and he told me about a story of a dude , who was very intelligent in artifacts and such , which pulled a big scam in I don`t remember what country exactly.

He did it like this : He bought 6 sewing machines that had serial numbers on them , not worth more than 200$ (but was the latest 6 sewing machines of that types, thought they not worth more than 200$ when he bought them) , after that he put up an advertisement stating that he buys sewing machines with those serial numbers , each one for 10,000$

After a year and no buyer(because he had them,so nobody else can sell it to him) he made a new AD saying he buys them for 20,000$ each and so on

After some years he pulls a big scam by selling his machines for I dont remember what price , and he sells them as in time(3-4 years) people knew that there is someone who buys those machines for hell of a price , but all he did was a scam.

Can this be true with bitcoin ? Can satoshi by 1clicking delete all the bitcoins ? Leaving everyone in an empty field ?

"I build this, let me know what you guys think!","I'm in the last year of a software engineering study. I followed the open innovation minor the study provides, where I can basically choose any subject that I want to learn about, and make something :). For me that subject was blockchain, being in bitcoin for almost 5 years triggered my interest to really learn about the tech behind it.

When I started with the minor I was a little clueless about what exactly blockchain was good for, hearing mixed things about it online for so long. On one side blockhain promises huge potential for all sorts of usecases but when I started looking in to it I realized that there really aren't that many legit usecases and that money and bitcoin is what the discussion should really be about. BITCOIN IS THE KILLER APP.

Teachers weren't very exited about my findings in the first place and kept pushing that there must be a lot of other things blockchain is good for, it took me a while to gather the right arguments to convince them that they shouldn't be looking a blockchain but instead focus a bit more(if not completely) on bitcoin. Anyway, one idea that stood out and that fitted limited time that I had in the minor was a gambling site, using the block hash as a random source. Not a new concept but I figured it would be a good one to learn about the tech. So I created https://www.blockhash.win/ where players can earn 2x their bet amount by guessing the right last digit of the blockhash that includes their transaction. I've spend many hours developing and I've learned a lot. I would recommend any software engineer or student like me to learn about the tech and build somthing. I learned a lot from the book that I picked up for this minor: Mastering bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (I would really recommend the book if your a software guy or just technical!)

I'm open for feedback and I'm really curious what you guys think of it, let me know :) If you would like to get started developing something bitcoin and don't know where to get started, hit me up! Don't cry about bitcoin's price, learn about the tech and develop something or contribute to an existing project.",1529259490,17/06/2018 18:18:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rsw45/i_build_this_let_me_know_what_you_guys_think/,1

Just some quick and very interesting math. $150 worth of btc today is the worlds smartest insurance plan on the future.,"Total money stock in the world is currently $84 trillion.

$84 trillion ÷ 7 billion people = $12,000

We wont have 21 million coins in existance for our lifetimes, and I am guessing if bitcoin does end up dominating as global money it will take no more than another 20 years to do so, so lets use a conservative number of bitcoins, taking into account estimates of lost coins. Call it 19,000,000.

19 million ÷ 7 billion people = 0.0027 bitcoin.

In essence this means if bitcoin works and dominates as global money sometime over the next 20 years then 0.0027 bitcoin will purchase the same amount of goods and services that $12,000 purchases today.

$12,000 × 83.33 = $1,000,000

0.0027 btc × 83.33 = 0.225 bitcoin

Conclusion:

Even you hate bitcoin you need to admit that no one knows what the future holds. So there is no way of knowing if bitcoin will work or not.

Think of bitcoin ownership as insurance on the future.

Today you can purchase 0.225 bitcoin for $1460.

If bitcoin dies well you lost some money but it wont affect your life drastically, but if bitcoin works you have guaranteed yourself a $1 million dollar ""equivelant"" fortune.

Today you can purchase 0.0225 bitcoin for $146. 

If bitcoin works this would give you an amount of bitcoin in the future that would purchase the same as $100,000 does today. If bitcoin dies you lost $146, so what.

I know people may pick holes in this math and subsequent conclusion. But my point remains the same. 

Owning even a tiny amount of bitcoin today like 0.0225 btc is insurance on the future. 

Even if I thought bitcoin would never work it would be stupid of me not to buy $150 worth just incase I was wrong.",1529262921,17/06/2018 19:15:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rtaca/just_some_quick_and_very_interesting_math_150/,1

They put their cards in backwards or upside down.  They select the wrong payment information or enter their PIN incorrectly.  They pull their card out before the payment has been processed.  EVERY DAY.  

My point is that we have a long way to go before Bitcoin can become widely adopted, maybe even decades.  Lengthen your time horizon.  Stop checking the price on a daily basis.  

I believe in the tech.  I'll continue to be an advocate for Bitcoin, but it's going to take time.  Patience is a virtue after all :)

BIP38 encrypted segwit paper wallets,"I've noticed that there's still not a password protect feature on any of the main segwit address generators out there.  This seems like a pretty important feature, am I missing something?

"Bitcoin June Crash - Regulation, manipulation or Hack?","Intertesting - [http://www.ccreview.com/news/june-bitcoin-crash-coinrail-hacks-market-manipulation/](http://www.ccreview.com/news/june-bitcoin-crash-coinrail-hacks-market-manipulation/)

The Bitcoin price today is now officially less than half of what it was at the start of 2018. Sudden 12&amp;#37; price pullbacks are being blamed on the hacking of obscure South Korean exchange, Coinrail. In terms of market cap, the recent Bitcoin market crash has seen the cryptocurrency market lose over $42 billion in value

As a Bitcoin trader, have you ever happened to do business with South Korean exchange Coinrail?

Thanks to Coinrail being the 90th least most popular cryptocurrency  exchange in the world, there is a strong likelihood that you’ve never  heard of the platform. – At least not until recently. Coinrail, after  all, is currently being blamed for single-handedly wiping $42 billion  from the cryptocurrency market. Specifically, thanks to a June 10th  weekend hack.

There is just one problem. Namely, that Coinrail is most certainly not to blame for the recent Bitcoin Crash.

A Reminder That Bitcoin Will Always Be Here,"Bitcoin will be here when you die, when you sell, when you buy. The network will live on for you, your children, your children’s children. 

It doesn’t matter if the price is $5, $20, $900, $500, $50,000, $10,000, Bitcoin lives on. 

Quantum computers? It needs 1500 quantum bits to BARELY affect. We barely have one that works and it’s only at 50 quantum bits, and sure, they can spend trillions of dollars of dollars to even TRY to hurt the Blockchain Network, and we can EASILY just fork it to where it was. Also, a reminder that quantum bits use sodium ions that goes away right after it’s used for ONE calculation, not even going to mention how almost impossible it is to stop the noise of that calculation or the necessity to keep a quantum computer at near 0 degrees when there’s 1500 quantum bits. Also, Bitcoin can have quantum proof algorithms. 

Look at all the progress we’ve accomplished this year alone. This is just a beginning. 

There are people in EVERY COUNTRY in the world who owns Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. And this can only grow. Bitcoin is too big to fail. With you, or without you. ",1529267971,17/06/2018 20:39:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rtuwk/a_reminder_that_bitcoin_will_always_be_here/,1

Alone none of us can do a thing to stop it. But what if we all  coordinated a set time to all purchase $20 of bitcoin.... what if everyone worked to spread the word and people really got behind it, Could we cause a reversal? how many people would it take? 500,000 people could do a $10,000,000 buy. Roughly 1500 BTC. Would swallowing up 750 btc at once on two of the larger exchanges be enough to spark a reversal? What do you think it would take? what about a million people and $50 each? I feel like if we really organized something, and utilized the right people in the bitcoin communities to get the word out, we could actually do this. 

Just a thought. Its the only way I came up with that we could actually do anything other than sit back and watch the rich get richer and take control of the crypto market. I dunno.

I just want you all to remember, you're all surrounded by individuals in the same boat as you. This community is HODL meme after HODL meme. This sub is barraged with instances of [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), 
 [Survivorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias), [Gambler's Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy), and so on and so fourth. It's a treasure trove of biased, and often imtes misinformation hammering you with everything bull related. 

I've been that guy who's lost 90% in minutes on an asset (See NVAX Sept '16). So it's important to remember to not invest more than you can afford to lose, not be afraid to cut your losses, set a bottom line (stop loss), Dollar Cost Average, and most importantly not fall prey to any of the fallacies we see so much on this sub. Do your research *outside* this sub and come up with an original thought after seeking unbiased sources. Meme's are fun and this is a great community, but this isn't monopoly money and I don't want to see anyone's families ruined, homes foreclosed on, or anything else because they got caught up in the Lambo, Moon, Hodl dream.

Is it legal to buy bitcoin in India?,"*Processing img epp6yxggnp411...*

Bitcoin’s thundering accomplishment towards the finish of 2017 demonstrated compelling to Indian financial specialists, in spite of bits of gossip that India’s national bank could put a stop to the token.

Right now bitcoin has not been prohibited or restricted, but rather India’s significant back organizations don’t remember it as lawful delicate.

India’s muddled association with bitcoin is all the more strange in light of the fact that neither the Government nor the **Reserve Bank of India** (**RBI**) has formally clasped down on it, however, have moved toward it with a tangible level of antagonistic vibe.

"Finally dipping my toes in BTC, very excited and grateful!","TL;DR: This subreddit has been awesome, my friend has been amazing telling me about Bitcoin, and I decided to get involved in my own limited way!

I've been following Bitcoin for a few years now. At first I loved it for the technical aspects, as a programmer it was fascinating to me. I played with the mining idea to see if I could use in other ways, like games. I've even been experimenting with creating a distributed database based  on the blockchain.

I met a coworker 4 years ago who was a bitcoin fanatic, and I talked with him about it often. He's an anarcho-capitalist who believes Bitcoin to be the future. We had some great debates, and I slowly turned. We've been great friends even after we stopped working together. He taught me about where Bitcoin stands, not just as technology but as an idea, about what fiat currency means, all that jazz.

This year, on his birthday, I decided to get him some Bitcoin. I got him 1 satoshi for every year he was alive! So I went to a bitcoin ATM, got the minimum amount, printed off an extra couple keys, went home and learned how to transfer it. The remainder I decided to keep for myself, as my first ever coins. Then I did was the internet suggested, generated my own wallet and swept the remainder into it (and gave .2mBtc to my partner!). This subreddit has been interesting for years, and now it turns out it's been really useful, so thank you for that, everyone!

I know it's not much, but here it is in all it's glory... MY wallet! 1PKPADd5ahbbaTE7pj9iuPtDUekTJN629m

Needless to say I'm **very excited**. I'm thinking I'll be putting a bit of my paycheck every month into it, and never converting back into fiat. If I spend any Bitcoin, it'll be at a place that accepts it (taking recommendations!). I'm pretty large in debt right now, because life, but I'm working hard at getting it down and never getting into debt again. However, I figured I can safely put about 4% of my income into my wallet every month, a bit more if I manage to finally quit smoking!

Thanks for reading, I know it's a ramble, I just had to share. I'm working on memorizing my 12 words as we speak so I can burn the paper! :)

One more thing, if anyone knows any programming projects that need to be made, please let me know. I'm happy to contribute, especially if there's anything in Go.",1529306871,18/06/2018 07:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rxn42/finally_dipping_my_toes_in_btc_very_excited_and/,1

Does the NSA writing Sha-256 raise any suspicion?,"On the noob side of the technical aspect of things. I understand that the NSA wrote the Sha-256 hash and that Satoshi used it apart of the mining algorithm. Does this raise any type of concern or suspicion that higher intelligence agencies might have a bigger role in bitcoin that we don't know about?  
  
Or is the sha something that many other people made a use out of and it has no direct correlation with the NSA, kind of like it's just some open source code they created and others can use it ?   
  
I just don't know what to think knowing a part of the code is from the NSA. I have zero trust in the US goverment especially the higher intelligence agencies, they are way to powerful and have way to much control.

Terrible Idea for a Bitcoin Vending Machine,"I've recently seen a lot of concepts for Bitcoin vending machines. I enjoy the novelty of these devices. They take an old concept, automating the exchange of money for a soda, or candy, and modernize it.

I can't help but think this could be expanded upon.

A lot of machines I see use a static QR code as a trigger. I thought - why not use a display to generate a unique address for every transaction? Different items at different price points could be vended in this way.

Then I thought, what if the person doesn't pay the proper amount? What if they overpay? Underpay? What if they can't pay at all?..

**That's an interesting concept. Someone who wants something out of a vending machine - yet they can't pay for it. A lot of us have been there. How terrible...**

What if this vending machine didn't sell soda and candy, but things like water, or high calorie meal replacements, or diapers, or feminine products? Necessities. What if the person who couldn't pay were legitimately needy?

Could this vending machine be fitted with a webcam? Could the needy person then appeal to someone on the other side of the webcam for funds to acquire this necessity that they need?

Who would they appeal to? An individual, or an audience? An audience on the internet?

Maybe that same, unique, payee's privacy-protecting QR code could be shown to some generous soul on the internet, one of many watching this webcam feed...

Maybe this person-in-need could appeal to this pool of anonymous, protected, endowed individuals to cover this expense. A single individual in this audience could then decide to cover this individual's expense. Maybe this pool of people would feel encouraged by a sense of helping this needy person?

Maybe the person running the machine could generate a profit from enabling this interaction?

Just a terrible idea I had for a Bitcoin Vending Machine.",1529310001,18/06/2018 08:20:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rxvfz/terrible_idea_for_a_bitcoin_vending_machine/,1

Bitcoin transactions helping police to track down illegal dealers,"**Bitcoin**, the Internet cash darling by PC researchers, libertarians, and lawbreakers, is not any more resistant. As of late as 3 years prior, it appeared that anybody could purchase or offer anything with Bitcoin and never be followed, not to mention busted in the event that they infringed upon the law. “It’s absolutely mysterious,” was the manner by which one analyst place it in Bitcoin’s gatherings in June 2013. “The FBI does not have a supplication of a possibility of discovering who will be who.”

ADAMANT – The Most Secure and Anonymous Messenger – Encrypted Within The Blockchain,"ADAMANT is a Blockchain-based system for data and message transfers along with an integrated payment system are providing a truly fundamental benefits for all-personal and business-like communications.

The ADAMANT team has done in depth research on the available messenger systems like Telegram, WhatsApp etc before they decided to create their truly anonymous messenger. As you can see in the table below you can see the many elements that are, or should be, part of a secure anonymous user friendly messenger. The table only shows the key players, the community manager told me the left out some other big players. But if you ask him he can explain the difference between every messenger and their product. Considering the market of messengers, the segment demanding truly communicate anonymous with ease is huge!

ADAMANT &amp; Technology

ADAMANT is a fully decentralized system that is based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus (DPoS) algorithm. This choice was made in order to meet the following criteria:

● DPoS allows for any transaction to be reliably confirmed within the 5 second interval. This time is critical for fast messaging and payment execution;

● DPoS dramatically lowers the system maintenance cost — there is no need for vast computing powers and therefore — barbaric electricity waste, comparing to POW;

● Fixed transaction fees;

● Dignified system scalability and reliability factors.

Unfortunately all modern use cases of the Ethereum blockchain are not quite suitable for maintaining the ADAMANT network. This is determined by a relatively high value of “gas” (transactions’ fee), that is used for every Ethereum transaction, including all message transfers. This is why ADAMANT is built on an independent blockchain — hence the transactions’ costs could be low enough to operate the whole network and they could also be adjusted based on the future rising token price.

Moreover, Proof of Work technology in not suitable either, because its maintenance cost is high, and with the grow of participants’ amount the transactions’ fee is rising up quickly. Considering these reasons a program code of the Lisk project is being used for realization of the server part and the blockchain itself. This source code was extended in order to obtain the required functional.

The ADAMANT architecture is flexible enough for allowing us to make changes to transactions’ fee, if needed.

The fact that the team really took a in depth research in the technological base is a good sign the team is able to both think of the current requirements as well as of the features desired for the further development of its platform. Since the chosen technology and the way the product is set up the platform could be trusted/used by the whole world, which is a huge target market!

Silk road and Bitcoins,"![img](o01evn6igr411 ""Silk Road and Bitcoins"")

 **Silk Road** is an online black market and the first modern darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. As part of the [dark web](https://satoshiuncle.com/more-cryptocurrency-payments-rising-on-dark-web/), it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website was launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior. Initially, there were a limited number of new seller accounts available; new sellers had to purchase an account in an auction. Later, a fixed fee was charged for each new seller account.

Adamant Personal &amp; Decentralized Messenger,"If you’re a privacy-sensitive individual, it most likely feels like a terrific deal, and perhaps even too good to be true. An app that doesn’t retailer your knowledge on an inside server, has no entry to your messages, limits the builders from locking your account and a lot extra.

Though not prepared but, Adamant is getting ready each an Android and an iOS cellular software that can allow us to have entry to the whole service wherever we’re.
What’s the catch?

Each message despatched by way of the service has a token value connected to it. zero.005 ADM to be exact. Personally, I believe it’s a truthful worth to pay for sending a very encrypted, safe, and untrackable message.

The token makes use of a DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) system to generate new tokens and so they have the whole scheme outlined of their whitepaper. There you may also study extra concerning the system, the brand new blockchain, and the staff behind this wonderful mission.

It’s definitely one thing new to the moment messaging market, however to be trustworthy this app just isn’t made for simply anyone. It’s made for the 1%, the those that have secrets and techniques they wish to conceal, and people which can be in want of a safe technique to talk.

"How to link Bitcoin Core with Armoury, and can money be sent to armoury when the blockchain has not been linked to it yet - i.e. can confirmed, irreversible transfers still be sent to armoury once the blockchain has been linked?","Hi all,

I recently bought bitcoin from Coinbase, and sent it to my armoury wallet, however I didn't actually install the Bitcoin Core blockchain until after the transfer was confirmed and irreversible. 

I am now downloading the blockchain, but I have a few questions;

The first one is how can I link Bitcoin Core with Armoury? 

And secondly, even if I link the blockchain to the armoury wallet, will I have lost all my money since the wallet was not ready to take the money? Or is that not how it works at all?

Also the Armoury wallet is always in offline mode. Is this due to the blockchain not being linked to Armoury?

Finally when I am on Armoury there is nothing displayed on my dashboard, and there is only one tab called ""dashboard"". I do not see any other tabs such as ""transactions"" or ""announcements"". 

I am using Armoury v0.96, and Bitcoin Core v0.16.1.

Thank you in advance for anyone who could help me out! I'm a complete noob.

Trading Bitcoin on margin is shitty - the swap is killing the profits,"In recent days I have negative swap (""financing"") on my short positions. On 1fox it's up to 0.3% per 12 hours.

On some platforms there is a 0.2% per 24 hours negative swap for long and for short positions (the broker is taking from both positions).

Sometimes the swap is paid by short positions, sometimes by long. There are months that overall swap is near zero, but some months longs or shorts pay more (double digit percent per month!).

This makes trading Bitcoin and other crypto on margin very shitty.

Compare this with EUR/USD swap rate (0.0025262% daily positive swap for short positions, 0.00715765% negative swap daily for long positions - the rates differ on different platforms, this is just an example).

Segwit2x was about medium of exchanges vs security. Lightning Network is giving us both.,"I've just read again ""[Segwit2x Post Mortem: Divorce of Crypto-Austrians and Crypto-Keynesians!](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/segwit2x-post-mortem-divorce-of-crypto-austrians-and-crypto-keynesians-87960b11ce4c)"" which is a great high level view of the segwit2x attack on bitcoin that happened in 2017, if not forever.

It's great to read those pieces a few months later, because it's way easier to see what happened, which agenda was pushed by who, and why engineers were right all along. And when you think about it, it wasn't just about segwit2x, it's clear that all altcoins wanted segwit2x to happen: it would have been way easier to bring take over the crypto king spot if Bitcoin's security was as average as the rest.

How strong is Bitcoin against 51% attack!," In order to calculate how much money do you need to perform a 51&amp;#37; attack on bitcoin:  


Current hashrate (Total network hashrate): 36349358,259 TH/S (From [https://blockchain.info/stats](https://blockchain.info/stats))  


We choose our miners from here:  
[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining\_hardware\_comparison](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison)  


Let's take for example: Antminer S9  
*Hashrate = 14 TH/S*  
*Consumption = 1.375 kW*  


**Cost of harwares:**  
*Hardware = Current hashrate \* Price of Antminer S9 / Hash produced by Antminer (per seconds)*  
*Hardware = 36349358,259 \* 2400$ / 14*  
*Hardware \~=  6,231,318,559 $*  


*Number of antminers = Hardware / 2400 \~= 2,596,382*  


**Cost of electricity:**  
*Electricity consumption per day = Number of antminers \* consumption \* 24*  
*Electricity consumption per day = 2,596,382 \* 1.375 \* 24*  
*Electricity consumption per day \~= 85,680,606 kWh*  


*Electricity cost per day = Electricity consumption per day \* Cost per 1kWh*  
*Electricity cost per day = 85,680,606 \* 0.045$ (*[*Electricity pricing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing) *- Depend on countries)*  


So attacker have to pay 3,855,627 $ of electricity per day !  


This without make calculation of transport, renting or buying local where to install all this stuff, without counting the difficulty to get this number of miners and electricity power required to get them working all.  


And counting the risk that the attack will not be a success and many other factors ...  


If you want to know more about Difficulty and Hashrate: [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty)  


I made calculation 2 days ago from here:  
[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4429114.msg39597354#msg39597354](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4429114.msg39597354#msg39597354)  


In the space of two days, we can see this changes:  
**Hardwares:**  
Today = 6,231,318,559 $  
2Days ago = 5,936,594,032 $  


**Difference \~= 294,724,527$**  
**Additional AntMiners \~= 122,802**  


**Electricity:**  
Today = 3,855,627$  
2Days ago = 3,673,266$  


**Difference \~= 182,361$**

Article: Forensic Accounting Challenges and Valuation Considerations - Withum 2017,"**Virtual Currency – Forensic Accounting Challenges and Valuation Considerations**

Staying competitive means obtaining and maintaining new competencies around trends that impact our clients’ day-to-day operations. The ways people exchange money for goods and services is rapidly evolving, but the same challenges around tracking payment or valuing credit arrangements remain the same.

You’ve likely heard the buzz words “virtual currency”, “digital currency” or Bitcoin more frequently as of late. This article explores forensic accounting challenges and valuation considerations related to this new form of virtual exchange.

Digital currency or digital money is an Internet-based medium of exchange distinct from physical currency (such as banknotes and coins) that exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but allows for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer of ownership. Bitcoin is a type of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds operating independently of a central bank. Users have “wallets” which are anonymous, unique, account IDs that have associated with them virtual currency amounts. The virtual currency network self-regulates by giving all users a record of every transaction that has occurred between every wallet since inception.  This is meant to minimize or eliminate cheating between wallets. It is this ability to screen out “cheaters” that is encouraging global banks to adopt forms of virtual currency logic to improve security around its millions and millions of daily transactions.

Several steps are typically taken when performing a forensic investigation, including, but not limited to, reviewing legal information, financial documents and confirming or refuting allegations.  From a forensic investigation standpoint, tracing virtual currency transactions can create challenges when applying traditional forensic accounting techniques.

By definition, virtual currency is a decentralized currency. Since few banking or credit institutions (currently) deal in this type of currency, it is unlikely that bank or credit card statements exist for virtual currency transactions. A lack of documentation related to who owns the wallets and the purpose of each transaction creates traceability challenges. The existence of an unregulated, unaudited ledger begs the question of how transparent any given observable virtual ledger transaction really is. To investigate a specific transaction or set of transactions, the forensic specialist will need to not only have access to transaction information, but also have a way of mapping a wallet to a particular person or institution. Additionally, the investigator will likely require skilled information technology specialists to sift through the reams of data.  

Tracing wallet transactions becomes more like tracing cash movement than like tracing traditional electronic payment systems. In fact, the most reliable measure of virtual currency activity may only be the observed funding of the wallet and any transfers out of the wallet to a traditional currency account. 

Another consideration from a forensic accounting perspective is verifying if a transaction happened through a third party. While banks and credit card companies can be subpoenaed when dealing with traditional fiat currencies, the same does not hold true for virtual currencies. In a traditional setting, the forensic specialist can usually hold interviews with parties or subpoena the bank for account holder IDs. With virtual currencies, how does one determine if multiple wallets are actually held by non-exist persons or entities? 

The reality is that while the proponents of virtual currency laud its open framework, the anonymous nature of wallet transactions and lack of independently audited information makes tracing individual activity a challenge. 

Valuation professionals face similar challenges around data verification when valuing virtual currency loans. If the two components of any valuation are a calculated benefit stream and an estimated risk of not receiving the benefit, then virtual currency loans can be of varying degrees of risk depending on how they are structured. The virtual currency lender can see the balance of the virtual currency borrower’s wallet at all times; in essence, allowing it to monitor the borrower’s account activity. However this offers little recourse to the lender and only conditions and terms outside the virtual framework, like in traditional lending, can truly be enforced. Lastly, virtual currency fluctuations make market uncertainty a major factor to consider. Therefore, valuing a virtual currency credit agreement should look a lot like the valuation of an unsecured, risky foreign currency loan.

Forensic accounting and valuation matters related to virtual currency can be performed using the tools we use for traditional assets and liabilities. Practitioner’s can gain a foothold on this leading edge of finance as long as they are willing to handle the high degree of uncertainty and limited information available around transactions in this space.",1529345341,18/06/2018 18:09:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8s1o1p/article_forensic_accounting_challenges_and/,1

"Bisq: Open source, multi platform, P2P (i.e. decentralized) tor-based crypto exchange","Centralized crypto exchanges (coinbase et al.) are obviously at odds with the general philosophy of cryptocurrency. They've been extremely useful as a temporary measure to allow people to get involved, but allowing companies to have control over your private keys for any amount of time is not useful in the long term. I found bisq today and it seems like an ideal alternative, so I thought I'd try to spread the word.

The title of this post pretty much sums ot up, but it's a well deisgned open source desktop client for buying and selling any coins directly between people, with independent anonymous arbitrators. You can store and encrypt all of your wallets locally, and your coin/identity/IP is never stored on any centralized server. 

I thought this was all pretty impressive, and it seems to me to be the best path forward in terms of long term usage, storage, and freedom of control over your money.

India: Former Legislator in Bitcoin Extortion Case Declared Proclaimed Offender,"*Processing img 8syvwe2ruv411...*

An Indian court declared former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Nalin Kotadiya a proclaimed offender in connection with a Bitcoin (BTC) extortion case amounting to $1.3 million, Business Standard

Judge PG Tamakuwala declared Kotadiya a proclaimed offender or “absconder” under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with reference to an application filed by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Kotadiya “remained untraceable,” even after a warrant was issued for his arrest. The CID initatiated proceedings again, seeking that the court should declare him a proclaimed offender.

In India, a [proclaimed offender proceeding](http://legodesk.com/blog/mean-proclaimed-offender/) is a procedure of the court, by which the court announces the individual as a wrongdoer and compels police to apprehend the individual named in the procedure. The passport of the wrongdoer is also confiscated so that they may not flee the country. The ruling ordered Kotadiya to appear before the court within 30 days.

How to recover your lost bitcoin password？,"Website：http://recovermybtc.com/

Now many people who bought Bitcoin years ago find themselves sitting on an untouchable bounty，though it fluctuates every now and then，those lucky guys who purchased or mined just a few bitcoins at the early era of cryptocurrency nowadays still can boast about their savings happily. However, some of them now are in a painful limbo，because they can't remember the complex security passwords needed to get to their wallet. Everyone has a hard luck story about losing their Bitcoins. Whether it be throwing out an old computer or suffering a hack, nothing compares to the most frustrating situation of all —you have your wallet but you can't remember your password and you still don’t know how to recover bitcoin password. Unlike a bank, bitcoin has no central hotline to call for reset. This is really a bad thing，it's like forgetting a bank account password, but there's no bank to call to reset it. The money is lost forever. That might be a lot of money at today’s exchange rate.
Read a fantastic story recently about people who forgot passwords and are resorting to hypnosis, maybe sometimes it works but it's not scientific，lately the world of cryptocurrency was touched by two stories，one of them has a happy ending but another one isn’t so fortunate.
Did you lose your wallet password without any clue of what it might have been? Then it will be very difficult for anybody in the world help you to retrieve wallet password. No one, neither a Russian Hacker nor MI6, or the FBI can be able to crack that password to your crypto wallet. Mostly you know what the password should have been but maybe you are one character off or the capitalization is off, these common mistakes are the most likely reason that you are locked out of your wallet，and if there’s slightest chance you do remember parts of your password, or origin of it，then it’s a very big chance we can help you to retrieve your bitcoin password. 

     For those wallet holders who have forgotten their passwords, all may not be as bad as it seems. Hopefully BitcoinRecovery can help you to recover bitcoin password, it’s compatible with encrypted wallet documents of cryptocurrency including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other branching digital currencies which based on bitcoin or ethereum structure.

BitcoinRecovery is an advanced and extremely fast passwords recovery tool for encrypted bitcoin/ethereum wallets，we have created a highly optimized multi-threaded program to perform the brute-force decryption. It can set multiple arithmetic rules to crack the password in case of uncertainty. The software supports multi-threading processes and takes full advantage of multiple CPU/GPU layouts and it can ensure the program makes good use of all the available system resources. Its operation including comprehensive combination of passwords, covering all possible elements in a password (upper/lower cases, numbers / special symbols) to avoid missing out any character.
You need to generate a list of potential password phrases based on your best guess for password，and decryption is based on the rules you set up，the computer will combine all the characters you selected in a certain order，then it can create a highly optimized multi-threaded program to perform the brute-force decryption until it succeeds，the better the computer's CPU/GPU（with as many cores as possible），the faster the decryption.
One particular thing to note, this software is running locally, it doesn’t upload any of customers’ information, users can disconnect the network link to run the decryption process to recover bitcoin password, and their wallet security will be safe，without giving any people any chance to steal their money, so that we can protect our customers’confidentiality.
BitcoinRecovery works with Windows 10, 8, 7 and Mac. It's also available in a portable form for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, so it doesn't require installation.

The shill and troll army here are getting ridiculous. There is too much disinformation. 
Seriously, there is nothing to learn on this subredit anymore. Rarely there are some interesting discussions here about blockchain or lightning network, but as soon as someone states something truthful which doesn't favor the hype is  downvoted to abyss. 
I'd be a hipocryte if i said i'm not interested in price, but shill's hype articles and arguments that occupy ~95% of this subredit are getting tiresome.

Coinigy hangs in Chrome,"I've had an subscription to Coinigy for almost a year now, but some time this year it started to hang up when i try to change timeframe og change currency. I've tried to contact their customer service and they asked if i could disable all my plugins - which i have tried (even though i need at least two of them) but it didn't change anything. They finally asked me to ""please try guest mode"" whatever that means, and i asked ""do Coinigy have a guest mode?"", to which they replied:

I'm afraid we do not have a guest mode. What we do have, however, is a 30-day trial that you can use for a month which includes most of the features that are available with a full subscription.

I hope this helps
Best Regards,

Coinigy Support

So, apparently i won't get any help from them - it actually seems they have forgot what the case is all about and that i actually have an active subscription :D

Chrome is my preferred browser, but still i tried Internet Explorer just to see if it made any difference, and the hang up problem disappeared but now the price levels on the price axis disappeared, as well as the levels on the fib tool and several of the items in the menus above. 

Have anyone else had a problem with this, using Chrome?

From 2014 to the end of 2017 there were 20 Bitcoin ATMs installed in Australia. 24 More have been installed in the last 6 months alone.,"Saw this in a news article, but seems I can't post the link here:  

""Although the whole the cryptocurrency global market capitalization has seen somewhat of a downturn since its peak of over $1 Trillion Australian Dollars on January 8th, there’s one sector of the cryptocurrency space in Australia that shows no sign of slowing down; Bitcoin ATM machines.  

The first Bitcoin ATM installed in Australia was installed in 2014 in Pitt St Mall, Sydney, and up until the end of 2017, only 20 more had been installed across the country. However, according to Australian Bitcoin ATM locator site [FindBitcoinATM](https://www.findbitcoinatm.com.au), that number has more than doubled in the first half of 2018 alone – with a further 24 being installed.""  

Pretty amazing - there's still not one near me dammit!

Reasons for supporting and keeping bitcoin,"Hodl, statistically people who invested and never sold made more money than those who tried to trade often.  
Moon, it happened before and there is a big chance it will happen again, have patience and you will be rewarded.  
Lambo, i don't know about that, but at least a nice, fresh from the dealership Lexus, Mercedes, Audi or BMW will do just fine.
Venezuela, is a good example what can happen to fiat. There is a possibility that Banks or governments can null your savings.   
Crypto is future of money, a decentrilized currency without borders seems to be the best bet.
Fiat and banks will crash one day, power to the people!  
Be your own bank, banks won't have power over your savings and your funds will never be freezed.  
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin, the fiat price doesn't matter in the long run. You will gain a lot more than you can imagine as soon as institutional money pour in.  
You don't lose if you don't sell, historically only those who sold and didn't have patience to hodl, lost.   
Zoom out the chart, you should do this all the time whenever you feel like selling out of fear.  
I'm buying more bitcoin all the time when the price goes down, that way i gain a lot more when the price goes up. Think about it as a limited time discount.  
Feel free to add more reasons. ",1529407595,19/06/2018 11:26:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8s83fa/reasons_for_supporting_and_keeping_bitcoin/,1

Why I would never use Bitfinex ever again!!! Forget about tether or 2016 hack," Some days back, they processed the same withdrawal of a crypto twice but   debiting the bitfinex account only once. Effectively, I got some   cryptos for free worth significant USDs. Imagine such bugs making their   account balances declining slowly but steadily. Imagine that happening   if the withdrawal was a very large amount. I even contacted their  support and it has already been few days but no replies yet.

Bitcoin vs Gold vs Fiat,"Fiat currency is essentially ""play money,"" backed by nothing, easily (and legally) counterfeited by central banks.  Most of it no longer needs to be printed; the bankers merely type numbers into their bank computers and steal wealth from the rest of us.

Gold cannot be created from thin air by merely typing numbers into a computer.  Gold has the seven necessary properties to be considered ""good money"": Durable, divisible, portable, recognizable, fungible, **rare, and difficult to counterfeit**.  These properties only apply to real, physical gold.  Beware of gold-coated tungsten.

Bitcoin also shares the seven properties, making it a form of ""good money"".  Bitcoin is rare and extremely difficult to counterfeit.  Bitcoin has other properties which, for many people, make it even better than gold.

Throughout history, gold has remained precious, while fiat currencies eventually collapse.  Today's fiat currencies aren't looking so healthy, by the way - and this is why I remain long-term bullish on Bitcoin.",1529423740,19/06/2018 15:55:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8s9yji/bitcoin_vs_gold_vs_fiat/,1

I've made roughly 15 trades. Only two successful both I gained in-between $1000 - $1500. All other trades I lost much smaller amounts.

Finally when I lost my entire wallet it was about $4500 USD.

From what I understand I will have to pay taxes on the two trades that I made roughly $1000 on. Ideally i'd like to not report anyone of this and forgot this nightmare but Idk how screwed i'd be.

Understanding Basic Investment Fundamentals,"There is an investor with high followage on tradingview (goldbug1) who recently posted an article which I think everybody should understand in order to achieve the correct (healthy and reasonable) attitude when it comes to investing. The following are not my words, link will be included at the end of this post.

Whether it is gold', stocks, or crypto currencies, if you are a stacker with the intent to build a portfolio of assets over a period of years, pullbacks in markets are a time to buy. How many of you save your money to go shopping on Black Friday? When the grocery store has a sale on your favorite cereal do you think “hmmm I’ll wait and see if it’s lower next week” ? We get excited when we see a television or laptop go on sale and we do not hesitate to buy. Unfortunately when it comes to investing, for some reason, most want to pay higher prices? This is where many investors, simply get it wrong. 

In 1997 Warren Buffet’s letter to shareholders included a short quiz. 

Question: 
Q1. If you plan to eat hamburgers throughout your life and are not a cattle producer, should you wish for higher or lower prices for beef? 
Q2. Likewise, if you are going to buy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you prefer higher or lower car prices? 
These questions, of course, answer themselves. 
Q3. But now for the final exam: If you expect to be a net saver during the next five years, should you hope for a higher or lower stock market during that period? 

Answer: 
Many investors get this one wrong. Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for many years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed when they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the “hamburgers” they will soon be buying. This reaction makes no sense. Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should be happy at seeing stocks rise. Prospective purchasers should much prefer sinking prices. 

Warren simply nailed it. If you are in accumulation mode of assets, why would you want the price to move higher? You should be happy it is moving lower allowing you to accumulate more. I can tell you from experience as a long time metals stacker, you can never have enough metals when the price starts to run. I remember when silver' hit $17 in 2007 and I thought to myself, “boy I wish I would have bought more”. That was truly the first time it hit me that I should not be wasting my money on cars and crap, but on building my asset base. If you believe that in three, five or 10 years down the road Bitcoin' will be much higher than today, then why would you not add if you have the means to? If you think Bitcoin' is a fad, or bubble then you simply should not be speculating.

Bitcoin &amp; Your Politics,"I’d like to ask Bitcoiners (old and new) what your personal political leanings are and how Bitcoin fits (or doesn’t fit) into that. I’ve read some interesting things. 

Disclaimer: I’m an American who has ben living abroad for 10+ years so that’s my vantage point.

I know Bitcoin began with cypherpunks and libertarians. Both of those political leanings are more fringe politics, not as mainstream. 

I know after that, conservative (Republican) supporters entered the space, and that it has also been appealing to some liberals (Democrats). 

So now my questions:

1) What are your personal political leanings as related to Bitcoin?

2) In what way do you think Bitcoin affects politics that you disagree with (good or bad)?

3) Do you think the Bitcoin space is ready for true mainstream Bitcoiners who won’t share your political views but will (try to) find a way for Bitcoin to fit into theirs?

4) Please recommend any articles / books that you have read and liked on any of these topics. 

I recommend this as a [critical but interesting Bitcoin article](https://www.salon.com/2018/06/08/how-bitcoin-made-right-wing-conspiracy-theories-mainstream/) about conservative conspiracy theories entering the space.

Cheers - I hope and ask for this thread to remain respectful and kept in line with a ‘this is my perspective’ take. ",1529456453,20/06/2018 01:00:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8se5lo/bitcoin_your_politics/,1

Is volatility the correct term?,"Bitcoin had a meteoric rise from around 1k to nearly 20k in December. When investors talk about bitcoin now, they mention the risk is in the volatility. 

Two counter points come to mind for me:

1.	 Should we measure volatility in dollars instead of measuring volatility in terms of contribution to the network, ie - hash rate? If we talk about the intrinsic value of bitcoin being based upon Metcalfes law, it would make sense that the volatility in value should be measured against the users of the network, and those users who stand to lose the most (miners) are increasing exponentially.
2.	 The value in dollars has been stabilizing since December towards the 6 thousand dollar mark. This signifies a trend for decreased fiat volatility within this timeframe.

I think that these two points highlight the fact that the most important people in the bitcoin ecosystem are more bullish than ever, the network is more secure than ever, and the volatility against the dollar is the lowest it has been in probably the last 20% of bitcoins lifetime.

Thanks for reading.",1529460023,20/06/2018 02:00:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sej6s/is_volatility_the_correct_term/,1

Using Bitcoin to pay for regular sites,"Hey, 
I've been wondering if I could get a bitcoin wallet, and put (for example, $50 worth of bitcoin in it) and use that to buy stuff online?

It's because of my inability to use PayPal 
all the time as it belongs to my friend, and I do not have one because I do not have a credit/debit card, so I was wondering if there was like a 3rd party that would take my BTC and turn that into regular dollars and redirect them to the site? 

I'm mostly wanting to spend on sites like Azure, and DigitalOcean for servers that power my website,
but I can't just keep asking my friend to use his PayPal and pay him back in cash every month.

Are there any services that do that? or maybe other ways to accomplish what I need?

PS: I'm relatively new to Bitcoin, having only heard about it, I never used it before this time, so I apologise if I said something wrong or incorrect, or just misunderstood how Bitcoin works.

Trying to understand a Segwit TX structure,"I understand how txs were structured pre segwit, now I am trying to understand how they work post segwit. 

e.g I am using is 

https://blockchain.info/tx/f91e7976cb46d5e65033d33a97f7bcc0ac3d444d8e01bba97077550c32e5270e

One of the articles I am using to try to understand was:

https://techtake.info/2017/08/22/segwit-bitcoincash-technical-details-explained/

This article says the new structure of a TX is:

Serialization format for transaction with SegWit:
Field Size	Name	Type	Description
4	version	int32_t	Transaction data format version
1	marker	char	Must be zero
1	flag	char	Must be nonzero
1+	txin_count	var_int	Number of transaction inputs
41+	txins	txin[]	A list of one or more transaction inputs
1+	txout_count	var_int	Number of transaction outputs
9+	txouts	txouts[]	A list of one or more transaction outputs
1+	script_witnesses	script_witnesses[]	The witness structure as a serialized byte array
4	lock_time	uint32_t	The block number or timestamp until which the transaction is locked

Now the script witness consists of:

Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
1. nVersion of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
2. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
3. hashSequence (32-byte hash)
4. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian)
5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
6. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
7. nSequence of the input (4-byte little endian)
8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
9. nLocktime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
10. sighash type of the signature (4-byte little endian)

Now when I look at:

https://blockchain.info/tx/f91e7976cb46d5e65033d33a97f7bcc0ac3d444d8e01bba97077550c32e5270e


Input scripts:

ScriptSig: PUSHDATA(22)[0014c6d9370d4ba53b3f07ff918fffd277a44fc1bca5] 
Witness: 02483045022100b8787c50f69bfd68a396161cb5cbc7996efbc04367e4355ff2211ba9fa6f1f5a02207171a33bc8cb0dcd54e51daacf168f6d4f9bf3998e918f1c195bd7f16d0c2867012102c31aab1a32fd115ce7a3f2edce54d86f0c36f4c946345926374ff7dee5e6a23e


Output scripts:

DUP HASH160 PUSHDATA(20)[caad1c0359b179cb13a4abd386d65846f0ed49db] EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG
0[] PUSHDATA(20)[b1596d2a53c9f86da51946ec21705f3a9bb0e6b8]


The input script sig (ScriptSig: PUSHDATA(22)[0014c6d9370d4ba53b3f07ff918fffd277a44fc1bca5] ) used to be part of the input in pre segwit. But there is no ""script sig"" in segwit, so if this part of the ""script witness""?

And ""DUP HASH160 PUSHDATA(20)[caad1c0359b179cb13a4abd386d65846f0ed49db] EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG
0[] PUSHDATA(20)[b1596d2a53c9f86da51946ec21705f3a9bb0e6b8]""

used to be the output script that is pushed onto the stack. Is this a part of the ""Script witness"" too?

Also, if I have two inputs, will I have two script witnesses? (because pre segwit each input had its own script, and each output had a pubKey script)

Also, this is a segwit tx. Is there any change in which a block is structured under segwit? If yes, any good doc I ca go over to understand that?

I know these are a lot of questions. Sorry.

Warning against scammer u/Zeredder from r/Bitcoin,"Hello. I've been scammed by u/Zeredder from **Bitcoin subreddit**. He convinced me and guaranteed that he would double my bitcoins in a week using bots and algorithms on the stock exchange. After sending the money he suddenly wrote that he lost his key to the wallet and now he says nothing. I know that I was easily fooled, but he took advantage of the fact that I am a teenager with depression and have problems at home. The truth is that he did not have the right to appropriate them if he guaranteed and convinced me that I would receive them. I am writing this here because I want to warn other novice users who have soapy eyes. I help my mother with household charges, medicines and he robbed me and did not give me money and does not speak

**I am writing this only to protect other naive people from this cheater because he wrote that he will continue to do so with other users and he can do it under another nickname**

How do I increase my Bitcoin holdings?,"Assuming that:

1. In the long term, Bitcoin will rise in value.
2. In the short term there will be price fluctuations.

Using these two assumptions, what would be a good trading strategy that slowly increases my holdings until the next bubble?

I am currently hodling but I need to convert a little bit to fiat every now and then to maintain my living, can I trade somehow to earn in the ""short"" term?

"Guy owns 8000 bitcoins, scams investors in Turkey","There is this guy who claimed to own 8000 bitcoins and said that he could disrupt the bitcoin market. He initiated with his partner a ""national"" cryptocurrency in Turkey. Scammed many people. Disappeared later.

Here is an example of why a ""national"" cryptocurrency can not succeed with such mentality in Turkey.

"Once adopted, will bitcoin really change the status quo?","Bought into bitcoin last year at $850 and have been a hodler since and am a long term believer in the technology.

One thing that bothers me is the need for custodians (banks, ie coinbase etc).

Bitcoin is too complex for the every day person to manage and because of this, we will always need a custodian to “safe guard” it.

Hypothetically speaking, let’s say the world adopts bitcoin as its store of value.

What is to say that governments won’t make bitcoin withdrawals from a bank like coinbase illegal and instead they issue promissory notes (fiat).

Would like to hear some thoughts on how this and how it could be avoided.

Bitcoin Theft From Calling Scam Ledger Wallet Customer Support Number On Google Search Engine,"         I'm posting this to warn others about dangers on the Internet.  I had about two-thirds of all my investments in Bitcoin.  I was unaware of all the scammers on the Internet until one stole the Bitcoins from my Coinbase account.  Ledger Wallet imposed a mandatory upgrade to their hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.  When I was following the online instructions, I was locked out of MyEtherWallet with 'Error Code 5' and didn't find the instructions on how to get around this until April 1st.  They were on the MyEtherWallet website and I could go on my account after following those instructions to find my ERC20 tokens.  
         Be aware that Ledger Wallet in Paris, France has no telephone support anywhere in the world.  All the listings for toll-free numbers listed on Google and other search engines are to scammers.  The following warning was posted on the Ledger Wallet Twitter Timeline March 1st, but I didn't notice it until after the theft of my Bitcoins on 3-8-18.  There is no such warning on the Ledger Wallet website which would have prevented me from falling for this scam.  

[**Ledger**‏Verified account @**LedgerHQ**](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ)📷 [Mar 1](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/969171921916121088)

WARNING: Ledger does NOT provide customer support over the phone. Beware the scammers impersonating the Ledger support team by using 1-888-XXXX (or others) phone numbers. Don’t give control of your computer to strangers and NEVER reveal your 24 words to anyone!

Never search for customer support numbers on search engines.  These are unverified listings.  If a company lists no telephone support numbers on its real website, it means they have no telephone support and they are not required to with cryptocurrencies.  Numerous customer support scams have telephone numbers which show up on search engines.  You should never call these numbers as you will be in contact with criminals.  You can type the number itself into the search bar and will often find numerous listings as the same number is being used to impersonate customer service for more than one company.  The scammer I called wanted to remote access my computer and I allowed him to do this as I thought he worked for Ledger Wallet without knowing Google doesn't verify the telephone numbers which appear on their search engines.  It showed up on the screen that several bugs were found on the computer which needed to be removed.  The scammer said my Bitcoins needed to be moved off my Ledger Bitcoin Wallet for my own security while he was removing the bugs he pretended to have found.  He suggested I move them onto Coinbase which I did.  When he was done with his pretend computer servicing, he said I should stay off the computer for the next twelve hours.  The next morning I went onto the Coinbase account and found the Bitcoins were gone.  They had been sent to anonymous Bitcoin addresses and could not be recovered.

I reported this sad story to the Palm Beach Research Group.  Their online educational materials introduced me to cryptocurrency investing, but they haven't included enough warnings for novice investors.  I received this message in response, but have omitted names as I don't have permission to post them.

I'm part of     's team and I help manage his editorial content and social media presence. We're very sorry to hear about your situation.      read your notes and passed them along directly to        . The team also passed along your notes to Palm Beach Research Group's Customer Service division. Even though what you went through is awful, we're grateful to you for sharing your experience with us; right now, we're doing exactly as you advised: looking into providing additional warnings, advice, and how-to guides for spotting and avoiding the more insidious and subtle scams that are out there. That content should be coming out soon, I am told. Again, what happened to you was horrible, but with any luck we'll be able to help prevent something like that from happening to other subscribers. Thank you.

It's gratifying to know others will benefit  from my mistakes, but I haven't found anyone who wants to restore the Bitcoins I lost.  I will provide my new Trezor Wallet Bitcoin address which has a zero balance at the time of this posting.  I would deeply appreciate any donations to help restore the 5.45130674 Bitcoins I had on my Ledger Wallet prior to the theft.  Please only donate if you are wealthy and have Bitcoins to spare as I will consider any Bitcoin I receive a gift.  It would help me survive this dreadful ordeal to recover the funds I lost and know I prevented others from losing much larger sums.  Feel free to pass this post on to anyone you know who owns Bitcoin.  Any donation will help.

3Hq4YJu9wfr8mLbx9ePQc79nKfN7mMUoex

I have verified this address is the same one which appears on the screen of my Trezor hardware wallet and my computer screen.  It's important to make sure these addresses are the same when you receive funds.  The address above can only receive Bitcoin.  You can test this address by sending a tiny amount of Bitcoin and private message corsicanainvestor on reddit.  I will reply as soon as I see the message to verify the amount received and validate this Bitcoin address.  Please only send a large amount after I respond to your message to be safe.

Here's part of a message I received from customer service at MyEtherWallet.  It contains important warnings about how to avoid dangers on the Internet.

I'm sorry for all you've been through. It seems that those funds may just be lost forever, but I can't help but hold onto hope that maybe you'll get some sort of reimbursement for all the trouble and heartache you've had. I really do wish you the best in all of this. Whenever you are curious about anything, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to try and point you in the right directions, for future reference. This crypto world is lacking in decent support, so we at MEW try to help anyone who needs questions answered, even if it is beyond our actual range of job coverage. Whatever information I have on security, I'm happy to help.

The phishers and scammers are on the loose! Protect yourself by installing [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige). Never enter your private information on ANY website without verifying it is the correct website. If you give them your private key, they can &amp; will steal ALL YOUR COINS.  - MyEtherWallet

I have added  the above mentioned Google Chrome extensions to my Google Chrome browser to protect myself from phishing websites.  They look very similar to the websites created by legitimate companies, but are run by criminals who want to trick you into providing private information so they can steal your funds.  EAL stands for EtherAddressLookup and can be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store.  MetaMask and Cryptonite by MetaCert can also be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store and I have all three.

Here's a list of more warnings I've come up with while learning about cryptocurrency theft.  It's important to warn others about Internet dangers to prevent scams.  These warnings came at a high price to me, but I want others to benefit from my mistakes.  I hope and pray my Bitcoins will be restored through donations from grateful readers.

1. Only call a number for customer service listed on a company's real website.  Never trust listings from search engines and be certain you are on the real website and not a phishing site.  The Google Chrome extensions you need to avoid them are mentioned in the conversation I had with a customer service representative at MyEtherWallet.
2. Never allow anyone you don't trust to have your private keys to MyEtherWallet or anywhere else your funds are kept as they can and will steal all your funds.
3. Never allow a stranger to remote access your computer even if a listing on the Internet appears legitimate.  This is something scammers want to do so they can come back later to steal your funds.
4. Be aware there are multiple ways the professional thieves have devised to steal your funds.  Never trust an email is from who it appears to be from.  If there is personal account information requested, never provide it.  It's very dangerous to click on links in suspicious emails.  You could be downloading malware or visiting a phishing site.
5. Never trust a caller on the telephone is who they claim to be.  Anyone who claims to work for a legitimate company and asks for sensitive personal information is likely wanting to steal from you and will tell you a pack of lies to put you in an urgent state of mind.
6. Never reveal your 24 word phrase to a cryptocurrency wallet to anyone.  Keep a record of it offline where you know it's safe and never take a photograph of it or put it into an email.  Those 24 words could be used to clone your wallet and steal your funds.
7. Trezor Wallet is recommended over Ledger Wallet as many Ledger Wallet customers have had unresolved issues due to a mandatory upgrade.  This presumed upgrade caused me to lose all my Bitcoins which could have been prevented if the March 1st Twitter Warning had been posted on the Ledger Wallet website.  Even after reporting this theft to the Ledger Wallet online support people, there is still no warning on the Ledger Wallet website regarding their telephone impersonators.  This was a negligent omission as this could have been copied and pasted from the Twitter Timeline March 1st and spared me this nightmare.  A warning about a security threat should not be reserved for the Ledger Wallet Twitter followers.
8. Avoid using cryptocurrencies to make purchases online as the transactions are irreversible and you cannot dispute the charges as you can with a credit card.
9. Always be wary on the Internet and never take posts at face value.  They may not have been made by the people they are pretending to be and thieves will try any trick you can imagine and some you would never have imagined.  The Internet is a dangerous place filled with scam artists.
10. If a company has no telephone support number to call listed on their real website, it means they don't have telephone support.  Do not look up these numbers on search engines as this is how you will come in contact with criminals who want to steal your funds.
11. Never use a hardware wallet which has already been initialized and never order one advertised as being used.  People have lost their life savings by purchasing Ledger Wallets on ebay which have scratch off cards to reveal their 24 word phrase.  This was not packaged that way by the manufacturer.  It was tampered with and repackaged by someone who wants to steal your funds.
12. Beware of scams around every corner of the Internet and never take postings at face value.  They could be made by criminals impersonating real customer support people you cannot call on the telephone or expect them to make any response to your online support requests on their own website.  It's a sad world of thieves and scammers on the Internet and it's easy to fall into their traps.  The lack of decent customer service in the cryptocurrency sphere has created a dangerous place for anyone who hasn't been warned about the extent that Internet thieves will trick and deceive their victims into thinking they want to help solve problems the company they pretend to represent cannot solve for you as they have no real telephone customer service and their online customer service is so poor that many see their requests for assistance never responded to.

Central Banks throw in the towel.,Basically seems 90% of FUD is from bankers and their institutions. Just trying to delay the inevitable. Nobody enjoys paying someone else to watch their hard earned money and be told when you can and cant use it etc. Remember when you actually went into a bank yeah that's gone now. Remember actually speaking to tellers yeah nobody does that anymore. It's like watching Sears fall apart to Amazon. Dont adapt you're gone with the wind.

The best analogy of Bitcoin I've ever read," [**Could you please explain to me in simple English how Bitcoin works?**](https://www.quora.com/Could-you-please-explain-to-me-in-simple-English-how-Bitcoin-works) 

In a prison, there are no currencies. No one has access to money of any kind. But a prison, although small, is still a society. And a society needs to trade goods and services. Maybe someone is a barber. This person will cut people’s hair but wants something in return. Something that he can use to later go to his cellmate and give him in return for the book that he wants from him. The cellmate also needs something in return for the book to use for getting himself another book.

How do you do this without money?

Well, they use cigarettes as a currency. A hair cut is worth 20 packs. A chance to play basketball is worth 10 packs. A book is worth 5 packs and so on. There is a problem. There are not enough cigarettes inside the prison in each person’s hands to be able to do all the transactions. But everyone knows that once a week a new supply comes in. So instead of getting the packs from each other, they start “owing” each other some packs of cigarettes. Joey gets a haircut and he owes the barber 20 packs. The barber gets a book and owes John 5 packs. Once the new shipment comes in, everyone will settle their debts.

But how do we keep track of all this?

Well, everyone will have to carry a notebook with them. Whenever two people make a transaction, they both write it down in their books. Luke writes “I owe Johnny two packs” and Johnny writes “Luke owes me two packs”. This way we know who owes what to whom. But we all write everything in the same format. One transaction after another. So it becomes a long chain of transactions. If I know how many cigarettes I had at any point and go through the transactions after it, I can figure out how many cigarettes I will have.

Last problem: how do we know what people wrote in their books are correct and no one is faking transactions? I can go steal someones book and write a fake transaction in it.

Well, to overcome this we assign the wisest most trustworthy person in the prison as a witness. Whenever two people are making a transaction, he has to witness it and sign both books with his own signature. This way, we know that each transaction is witnessed by our trusted person and actually happened.

Cigarettes are bitcoin. Notebooks are ledgers. The agreed upon text format in the notebooks is blockchain. The wise persons are bitcoin miners.

How does Coinbase actually make money?,"Hi ladies and gentlemen. Business newbie here.

How does Coinbase actually make money? I know they charge fees, but due to bitcoin's volatility they could potentially lose money just by bitcoin's price dropping.

Basically, for example: a good number of people sold 100,000 BTC on December at around 17-19k USD, then right up to this month, bitcoin is worth less than half. Hence, people could buy those BTC for significantly lower prices.

Can anyone shed some light on this?",1529513805,20/06/2018 16:56:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sjxqb/how_does_coinbase_actually_make_money/,1
Bitcoin 101 – What is The Longest Chain Rule? ( A Farming Analogy!),"Hey guys,

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

While many of us are strong supporters of Bitcoin (and other aspects of blockchain) – there are still some key concepts that we don't fully ""grasp""

&amp;nbsp;

If you understand these concepts, however, I am certain that your love for Bitcoin will increase – **and so shall your conviction to hold through market downtrends** ;)

&amp;nbsp;

That being said – I know it's not easy to wrap your head around some of the stuff. So I've written SUPER SIMPLE analogies to help you!

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks ago I wrote one on the Proof Of Work Puzzle

Today, I wrote an analogy on an equally important but often under-discussed topic: **The Longest Chain Rule**


&amp;nbsp;

If you understand The Longest Chain Rule it will help you with other concepts as well (Like 51% Attack, Double spends etc)  So I wrote an analogy to explain the meat of it – **A Farmer Analogy**

&amp;nbsp;

(Expert reader beware – I kept it super simple ;) )

&amp;nbsp;

**[Formatted &amp; Readable Orignal Post](http://www.mangoresearch.co/understanding-longest-chain-rule/)**

&amp;nbsp;


-----------------

# Longest Chain Explained  - A Farmer's Analogy

Let’s pretend we’re all farmers living in a small town. Majority of us farm rice as our major source of income. Weharvest the rice and pack them into 1KG gunny sacks and then carry the sacks to the Townhall. The sacks are then placed onto the only carriage the town has and transported to The Main City and sold.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

####**The Town Hall Meeting:** One day a Town Hall meeting is called to discuss the size of the gunny sacks...

&gt;An angry debate ensues on whether or not they should increase the size of each gunny-sack. Some farmers want the increased gunny-sack size for increased profits. But other farmers are against the idea – and claim it will make it more difficult for the older/younger/weaker farmers to carry the gunnysack to the Townhall.


&amp;nbsp;


####The Mayor suggests that a **vote** should be conducted to solve the matter. However, an objection is raised:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“How is that fair? I do more work than these guys. I harvest far more rice. My vote should count more”

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


####**The Vote:** That’s when a farmer named Satoshi comes up with an idea. He suggested that the next time they come to the town hall – they vote with their gunny-sacks of rice.

&gt;Each gunny-sack would represent a vote. That way, if you have more gunny-sacks you can cast more votes.Each sack of rice would be proof of their hard work. Farmers who worked harder, had more rice – and hence got to cast more votes 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

####**The Result:** Everyone loved the idea. The next day, two rows were laid out near the Town Hall. The first row represented _“Increase Gunny Sack Size”_ and the second row represented _“Don't Increase Gunny Sack Size”_

&gt;Farmers would carry their gunny sacks to the town hall and place each sack in one of the two rows – thus casting their vote.   The row that had the longer chain of gunny sacks would be picked as the final decision. At the end of the day, the **_“Don't Increase Gunny Sack Size”_** row had the longer chain of gunny sacks – and thus was the winner!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


Disagreements within a blockchain are pretty much solved the same way. Each gunnysack represents a “block” in the blockchain.  A row of gunny sacks represents a chain.

&amp;nbsp;

Whenever there’s a disagreement, network participants can “fork” off the current chain. Thereby starting a new chain of blocks. Participants who agree with this new chain can now start applying their “blocks” to the new chain as well. Eventually, if the new chain extends the old chain – the Longest Chain Rule will kick in and will be declared the winning chain.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Longest Chain &amp; “Work”

In our analogy, farmers were adding sacks of rice to “vote”. These sacks of rice are tangible and represent work done. The longest row of sacks represents the majority.

&amp;nbsp;

Similarly, in the blockchain, miners add a block to the chain to cast their vote. And the longest chain of blocks represent the majority. Miners on the network compete against each other by attempting to solve a puzzle – in order to win the “right” to add the next block onto the chain. 

&amp;nbsp;

A miner consumes a lot of electricity to solve these puzzles. But each time he wins (i.e solve it before someone else does)  – his block gets added to the chain.

&amp;nbsp;

##But - How does a “digital” block represent something tangible/work? 
&gt;In a way, the miner has permanently applied his electricity onto the block he just created. Since he won the solved the cryptographic puzzle, his block (with his ‘electricity’) gets added to the chain. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#So now you could say...

The farmers ‘proof of work’ was his sack of rice – and hence got to vote. After all the farmers place their sacks of rice in each of the two rows, we have our decision because: 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;​“The longest row of sacks represents where the majority farmers have placed their vote”

&amp;nbsp;

The miner’s proof of work is his winning “block” of transactions - since each block represents a miner’s electricity consumed – the entire chain represents the consumed electricity of all the previous winning blocks.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“The longest chain of blocks represents where the majority miners have placed their vote""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Concluding Thoughts - Longest Chain &amp; Immutability

Remember, energy is never destroyed – simply transferred. In the proof of work, you could say that the energy is transferred to secure the blockchain.

&amp;nbsp;

Why ‘secure’? Because to change a block, you’ll have to redo the “work” that was needed to create that block.

&amp;nbsp;

To undo any of the previous blocks, you’ll have to redo the work for that block and every block that followed it. I’ll explain (in detail) why in another post. But this is what gives Bitcoin it’s strong immutability.

&amp;nbsp;

In essence, an attacker will have to start a new chain and do enough work to also become the longest chain. If and only if  his chain is the longest chain will it be considered the winner and valid. And you may understand now – to achieve this, would require consuming a lot of electricity. This is why The Longest Chain rule is so crucial to understand

"To date, none of the 2x signatories have apologized","They claimed they had consensus for 2x: No poll or any social measure ever reflected that, the futures market valued 2x coin at less than 10% of BTC (which is why they cancelled cuz they can't put their money where their mouth is), cypherpunks in Core, Nick Szabo, Adam Back, the bitcoin community, etc said NO2X and yes to SegWit

They claimed there was no way of gauging consensus: Yet they never did any polls or any meaningful ways of gauging it and when they did, people said NO2X and yes to SegWit.

These are dishonest people.  They aren't incompetent, they aren't ignorant, they are purposefully dishonest.  REMEMBER, these people were heading big exchanges like Coinbase and over 95% of the hashrate.

Only Wences of Xapo has apologized.  No one else.  Not Barry Silbert.  Not Jihan Wu.  Not Erik Voorhes.  Not Roger Ver who says people wanted his vision.

I just released a pay with Bitcoin EP,"So I've been trying this in various guises since 2014 - getting people to pay for music with Bitcoin.  My thinking has always been that people are averse to paying for digital music as it doesn't really have any value.  And by that I mean when you bought a CD or a vinyl, you were actually buying *something* and it feels natural to exchange something with weight (fiat) for something else with weight (a physical copy).  


It's not very sophisticated at the moment.  Literally each track's name is a BTC address (which actually fits perfectly with the dark, droning ambient music I make) and the idea would be that if you send a few satoshi's I'll send on a high quality audio file.  


It's a bit of a faff at the moment as it means someone sending me the BTC, then letting me know with a txid so I can match it up and then me emailing the track to them.  If anyone has thoughts on a more elegant way this could be achieved I'd love to hear.

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash: A Scaling Debate Retrospective,"Hello! My name is Malcolm Rose and I write educational articles about cryptocurrency. I usually try to remain as apolitical as possible, but recently I've decided that enough time has passed since the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash fork that a retrospective might be useful to newcomers and veterans alike.

I want to stress that this is meant to be written from a neutral perspective, as I am not an ideologue for either side! I own both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and I'd love to see a future where both coins succeed on their own merits. This article gives a very high-level summary of the positions taken by both sides, and some of my thoughts on how people on both sides can go forward productively into the future.

I'd love to hear your thoughts - do you agree? Disagree? Let me know in a comment! Also, feel free to tell me if I've missed anything important or gotten anything wrong - I'll edit the article accordingly if so.

A lesson from my younger self about investing,"I was just playing around with this thought and I know it might make sense for that somebody that used to be like my younger self. Hopefully preventing them from doing something they might regret in the future.   
 

When I was around 19 or 20 years old and invested in my first stock I remember being to anxious to wait. I did understand that you had to wait, but in my mind the waiting would be around 2-6 months. If after all those months I saw no big difference in the stocks I would sell them and often times at a loss.   
 

I still hadn’t mastered the patient part.   
 

Years later I looked back at most of the stocks I invested in and in a lot of cases I should of just waited.   
 

If I could tell my younger self anything I would tell the fucker to be patient. Just like a tree, it takes time for things to grow but once it stands tall, it will stand for a long time.   
 

There’s a high probability that the blockchain will exist and evolve for the next couple of years/decades. You know how I know that? Because it’s been happening for the last couple of years.  
 

Research good companies and try to look at it with a long term perspective. What market could they dominate, do they have a working product, who’s in their team, etc.  
 

Reddit, google, facebook and others didn’t become the giants overnight. It took time, hard work and patience. A shitload of patience!   
 

The younger you start investing, the sooner you’ll stop gambling  
 

Feel free to give any feedback on the thought!

Will **Cryptocurrency Futures** become more accessible in the near future + can we expect U.S. based crypto exchanges to flourish?,"This post is not meant to provide education to those interested in potentially taking advantage of the ability to trade derivatives (in this case mainly outright futures), not to discuss whether crypto derivatives are good/bad for the space. Also, for everyone to discuss the BEST options for trading crypto at U.S. BASED crypto exchanges (U.S. entities). Of course, there are great exchanges abroad – but I would hope that people are interested in discussing what we have going on at home.

Opinion for viable options, not in specific order by any means:
GDAX/Coinbase Pro + Poloniex
CME + CBOE

For whatever reason, currently as a U.S. citizen you cannot obtain an account to trade on margin from top exchanges. Off-topic for a moment as to whether you can trade on margin abroad, broadly speaking the answer is no. Many people will bring up Kraken – that is for another conversation. Whether this is due to regulations regarding “eligible contract participant” (ECP) requirements and/or a mixture of other reasons (which is not completely clear to me) – the fact is, you may be able to find leverage somehow but not with the majors (so to speak). With that said, if you are a reputable individual with a clean background it should not be an issue to obtain an account from a major brokers and trade futures. Is it a viable time to partake in outright future or options on futures? Couldn’t answer this, but would I can say is there is a lot of potential!

What are futures? Here are some resources to learn:
http://www.cmegroup.com/courses/introduction-to-futures.html
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp  

What will need to happen for you to trade futures? Well, many people reading this article may not have the means to currently become involved due to high margin requirements. Can this change? Hopefully. 

How do margin requirements go down? Well, this has much to do with the value/scale of the product, but very importantly otherwise despite the measure of value: Liquidity! (reduced risk) 

How does liquidity come into play? Many factors, a major component being interest/confidence/trust amongst institutions/shops. 

VERY importantly: Outside of the crypto markets rallying or not – fundamentally, why is it reasonable to expect that institutions could become more and more comfortable? I’ve been asked, how do they trust the process? The context being, some traditional investors fear cryptocurrency infrastructure and being stolen from and wonder why institutions would partake. In terms of risk, not including the actual performance of the markets, it is important to understand that outright futures are CASH SETTLED (financially settled). Unlike several commodity futures such as crude oil – there is no “delivery” of Bitcoin which will occur. In simple words, when a “cash settled” futures contract reaches a “final settlement” you get squared away as if you bet on anything (very broad description). Basically, outside of the value of crypto or lack of liquidity there is an inherent layer of trust between institutions and CME/CBOE. Basically, the technology is NOT exotic.

But what is exotic about Bitcoin futures: Liquidity. To provide a sense of the daily volume for an extremely a liquid product, let’s refer to E-mini S&amp;P 500 Futures and compare this to Bitcoin futures at the CBOE and CME:

(excuse any errors)
E-mini S&amp;P 500 Futures
estimated volume: 1,583,103 (“ES” - June 19th 2018)
prior day open interest: 2,595,978
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500_quotes_settlements_futures.html

CME Bitcoin Futures (“BTC” - June 19th 2018)
estimated volume: 1,563
prior day open interest: 2,258
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_volume_voi.html#tradeDate=20180425
Here you can see their daily exchange volume chart: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_volume_voi.html#tradeDate=20180619

CBOE Bitcoin Futures (“XBT” - June 19th 2018)
trade volume: 1,824
open interest: 5,365
http://markets.cboe.com/us/futures/market_statistics/daily/


You can’t simply compare futures contracts for different products in terms of volume and the e-mini S&amp;P is an unfair comparison, but this is just to provide an example. Generally as an example, if a contract as the CME could have 50,000 (or less) trades per day and be perfectly fine by traders (with extra care). What does this mean? Basically, if you want to trade futures without allocating double digit thousands to the initial/maintenance margin – you better hope for a consistent increase in depth. In terms of “options on futures” (options), thin as well but this post is already extensive. 

One fact you can count on: Trading futures at U.S. centralized exchanges is the most, or one of the most “pure” forms of trading you will find in terms of forensic transparency and market infrastructure. In terms of **U.S based** exchanges which provide ability to trade in the cash, let’s hope we continue to see GDAX/Coinbase Pro infrastructure grow, in addition to Poloniex/Circle. I’m aware all crypto exchanges have been a pain in the ass one way or the other, but let’s be honest – who else are we depending on in terms of U.S. BASED companies?

"Bitcoin won't replace the dollar, the pound, the euro or yen...","...stablecoins will. It's my belief that stablecoins will slowly become the new medium of payment and we shouldn't be worried by that. It will get more and more people into crypto. 

Stablecoins will be pegged 1:1 with sovereign/national currencies. That means they'll still be subject to quantative easing etc, but they won't suffer from the same volatility as traditional cryptos like bitcoin and ethererum. 

As time goes on, consumers and merchants won't see the need to redeem their USDC for USD and therefore the adoption of USDC and other stablecoins increases, adding to the overall adoption of crypto. 

I believe that will be the time where Bitcoin's decentralised, immutable qualities will start to shine.

More and more people will get fed up of the constant increase in supply of USDC, GBPC, EURC etc and realise that their better off keeping their savings in BTC and only cashing out into the relevant stablecoin as and when they need to.

Importing an Éclair Wallet does NOT include LN Channel(s)?,"I am moving my Éclair wallet to a new phone and I was able to import it from the seed, but my Lightning Network channel was not included. It's no problem since the old phone is still intact and I was able to close the channel there. 

This may have been obvious to more technical folks than I, but I'm pretty sure a MAJORITY of people would assume that the LN channel will be restored as part of the wallet. Someone could have dozens of open channels and lots of BTC that would be lost if their phone were lost or broken.

I know LN is still in beta and it was only a couple of mBTC that I was able to recover from my old phone. But, is this an issue with the Éclair wallet, the LN or me?",1529537162,20/06/2018 23:26:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sn0xm/importing_an_éclair_wallet_does_not_include_ln/,1

How might the stock exchange function if crypto was the dominant currency?,"In no way am I an economist but i would love some clarification. To my understanding the stock exchange maintains healthy inflation rates.

My family learned a hard lesson about inflation today,"My grandmother purchased a $10,000 life insurance policy way back.  We're talking the 1970's or so.   Let's say conservatively 1986 or so.  Adjusting for inflation, the policy should be $33,000, right?  Well, it was never updated.  Never added to.  She just kept the same policy all this time.   

Now to be fair, all she wanted in the end was to be buried next to grandpa.  Well, that's about all she's getting.  After a brief battle with some kind of stealth cancer that wasn't showing up on scans or really causing any problems until the very end.  Since it was mostly her stomach she couldn't eat and then one by one problems accumulated like a domino effect, otherwise, she would still be here starting chemo this week.  When we found out that what she left behind to accomplish the goal of a simple funeral, it was barely enough for even that.

Now, we had driven her way out of state to get her the best cancer treatment we could, but they couldn't even begin because the end was already sneaking up on her it turned out.  But thankfully, it was closer to her state of origin or rather where grandpa is buried because a THIRD of our funds went to shipment.  All the rest is going to the burial process, clothes, and a 15 minute viewing.  A full service would have been $700 an hour!  This doesn't even include the price of the plot and stone, which thankfully, was already purchased long ago when the cemetary was having some kind of family plot sale.  The casket is all coming out of pocket and there's no money for a grave-side service.  They don't even know what time she'll be buried so we can't even make plans to randomly show up.  

Also, travel expenses accrued for the living because someone's RV had to have repairs.  

Best we can do is a memorial service at home at this point.  I already spent a lot of time with her moving her to the cancer center and was actually on my way back to visit when I got the news.  There's no sense in me flying out across the country for a 15 minute viewing though when what I really wanted was to see the rest of my family so instead I've spotted them RV repairs and they're coming to visit on their way back to the other end of the USA.  


tl;dr
So basically, the value of the life insurance policy is only a third of its original value!  Imagine if you had bought $10,000 in Bitcoin that long ago and since Bitcoin didn't even exist in 1986 imagine waiting that long, 30 years.  Just since 2008, $10k in BTC would be well over $200 million!

Going off to college - how do I keep my bitcoin safe?,"I currently hold all my bitcoins and other alts on my ledger. I have 2 copies of my private keys, one in my house and one in my father's safe at a different residence. I also keep my ledger in an entirely different safe. 

I am going off to college and want to keep my private keys a ledger with me. What is a safe way to do this, because people could have access to my room and it is not viable to transport a safe to my university (which is in another city than my home - I will be traveling by plane). 

Is it best to leave one copy of my private keys home, one with me and the ledger. Or just bring the ledger with me and leave the private keys at home.

The Reserve Bank of India is finally banning financial organizations from providing services to businesses dealing in cryptocurrencies.,"Received this today from Zebpay, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in India.


""Dear User,

This is a VERY IMPORTANT announcement in light of the recent Reserve Bank of India circular: DBR.No.BP.BC.104 /08.13.102/2017-18 dated April 6, 2018.

Our industry has approached the Supreme Court of India to challenge the circular, as we feel it is counterproductive, and against the interest of citizens. As a responsible corporation, we regard customer-protection and market-integrity as our primary objectives. In light of that, please note that if Zebpay bank accounts are disrupted, rupee deposits and withdrawals will become impossible. This can cause discontinuation of crypto trade based on rupees, or at least cause significant price movements. This is something you should keep in mind if you choose to hold rupees in your Zebpay account.

Please note that you will not be able to withdraw rupees unless Zebpay has banking services that permit such withdrawal. Also, in case of disruption of banking services to Zebpay, you hereby indemnify Zebpay, and agree to hold Zebpay free and harmless at all times, against all claims, proceedings, expenses, costs, actions in the event of any prejudice and/or loss being caused to you by any act or omission by Zebpay or any other party, in regard to your rupee balance, transactions, trading, deposit, or withdrawal.

Of course, since our bank accounts are functional at the time writing this announcement, you are welcome to place a withdrawal request for your rupee balance. If you do that, we will endeavor to return your rupee balance to your bank account as soon as possible, so long as our banks support such withdrawal. If you choose to withdraw your rupees, please make sure to also cancel your unexecuted trade orders if any.

Regards,
Zebpay Team""",1529575429,21/06/2018 10:03:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sqn9v/the_reserve_bank_of_india_is_finally_banning/,1

I have some bitcoin in my Zebpay account and today I got an email from them saying they may shut down the withdrawal due to bank regulations any time. Since I am planning to keep my Bitcoins for years, I am better of moving them to a personal wallet than to some exchange.

"Bitcoins next bounce, how it will look, my humble prediction","In the past few weeks bitcoin was hit with a lot of negative news. Hacking of exchanges, Tether manipulation rumors etc.

The price held strong at about the level it is now, mid 6000's. 

While all this was going on, SQ got approved by NY state to process BTC and more merchants are using either BTCPAY or other systems to accept BTC.

More Bitcoin ATM's have also been going up all around the world.  

There are now people sitting with cash on the sidelines and waiting to get involved in Bitcoin. This holds true with any investment that has a big drop from it's high. 

Think about real estate and how much is dropped during the 08 crash. The recovery has been very strong in many markets, but most people who waited to get in missed out early on, they got in later and it kept driving the home prices higher and higher now for 8+ years! 

I can say the same about the US stock market and many other investments.

Any investment that has many people with cash sitting on the sidelines waiting to get involved, will always see the same pattern, it will start moving up, FOMO will kick in, and you will see the price rise to numbers nobody can explain.

Predicting a date when something will happen is a foolish thing to do, however, predicting a pattern or probability can be done with a high degree of certainty. 

My guess is that as soon as BTC breaks 7500 the move to 1000 will be within a week, at that time real FOMO kicks in and predicting how fast and how high it goes from there is impossible because with FOMO activated all common sense vanishes and with common sense vanishing everything is possible.

Anyone else interested on trying my Bitcoin app?,"Lightning network is also on the plans to be implemented. 

Quick use case examples.

**Find an item** (i.e., a dress) that you may have seen in a magazine or on a website (such as Pinterest or Instagram). If you don’t know where to buy online, you can upload a photo and ask other Bitfortip members to search for it online to win a  bitcoin reward. UI is like Instagram so it's pretty easy to use. 

**Find a better prices** By offering a small Bitcoin reward for members to search for you, you increase your probability of finding that item at a lower cost.

**Find a piece of information** on the internet that you may not know about. Post an inquiry along with a Bitcoin reward for people to find you a certain link, image, etc.


**Once you create an account**	 a bitcoin address is generated where you can then deposit some funds to post an inquiry on the platform. Minimum amount required is 0.0001 BTC roughly 10 cents.

If anyone wants to try it, send me a pm with your **username and what would you like to find, so I can give you some test funds**

"Blankfein uses the term ""consensus currency"" rather than ""cryptocurrency"", and so should we.","The CEO of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein used the term ""consensus currencies"" in his recent interview: 
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/20/bitcoin-is-not-for-me-goldman-sachs-ceo-lloyd-blankfein-says.html


And he's right. There a lot that's interesting and innovative about Bitcoin--and the cryptographic protocol that it is is chiefly among them.

And sure, the people here get that.


But the name you use to describe something is also the entry-point you use to introduce it. For many, the name they use to describe something is the majority of what they understand about it. And so, ask yourself: What's the first thing people should know about these currencies? 

Is it how they work? (Crypto)

Or is it for what purpose? (Consensus)


Consensus currencies, i.e. not government currencies, not fiat currencies, not currencies controlled by some sovereign--but by us; by our agreement.


From that, the questions flow naturally: How does it work? Do people vote? How do you prevent cheating or stealing? And that is a great opportunity to teach them about the cryptographic protocols.


Eventually they'd ask the most obvious question: ""What if I don't agree?"", which might be the most beautiful aspect of the consensus mechanism and voluntary association. ""Then,"" you'd reply ""you simply start your own consensus of 1, and if your idea is a good one--get people to join in. That way, the largest currencies with the most robust consensus rose to the top by being the most reliable ones, backed by millions agreeing to work, associate and collaborate together"".


And in my opinion, if they know nothing else, that'd be the one thing to know.


Looking forward to your feedback on this idea.",1529596367,21/06/2018 15:52:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sszjy/blankfein_uses_the_term_consensus_currency_rather/,1

The Reason why Bitcoin Got Famous,"Every one has its own opinion but the fact which I had seen is dated at 2011 when the medium of accepting payments beside paypal was usually [Libertyreserve.com](https://Libertyreserve.com)  at most Forums  or merchants because of no charge back policy.80&amp;#37; Drug lord and black marketers were using LR.

 In May 2013, Liberty Reserve was shut down by United States federal prosecutors under the [Patriot Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) after an investigation by authorities across 17 countries. The United States charged founder Arthur Budovsky and six others with [money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering) and operating an unlicensed financial transaction company. Liberty Reserve is alleged to have been used to launder more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds during its history.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty\_Reserve#/media/File:Liberty\_Reserve\_seizure.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Reserve#/media/File:Liberty_Reserve_seizure.png)

 After its Closure I had seen users ,merchants ,everyone running to find an alternate payment method so now the traffic started adopting money,Obviously, Liberty Reserve is not the only e-wallet available on the market, however most of the alternatives are regulated and comply with way stricter requirements. [Moneybookers/Skrill](http://www.forexbrokerz.com/page/moneybookers-forex-brokers), for example, is regulated by the [FCA](http://www.forexbrokerz.com/page/fca-regulated-forex-brokers) in the UK, and demands document verification from its users so even if the payment provider is used for illegal purposes, the involved parties can easily be tracked down. And that is not the case with Liberty Reserve. 

Which is not to say that everyone who uses Liberty Reserve is a fraudster.

soon the merchant started using bitcoin and surprisingly the popularity started as there was no chargeback and completely anonymous for drugs king.

if you look at the google 5yrs trend keyword chart of bitcoin you can see exactly the date of liberty reserve closure and the rise of bitcoin in popularity and in usage.

Cold Storage Coins™ Confirmed to Join Experiential European Tour this Summer with The Evolving Caravan,"**SINGAPORE (PRWEB)** **JUNE 20, 2018**

European travelers this summer are in for a treat when the Evolving Caravan rolls into town, because this year the experiential tour includes the hottest item on the crypto circuit - Cold Storage Coins™. For those new to this wallet technology, or crypto in general The Evolving Caravan is excited to offer their latest hands-on experience, so people can finally “get it”.

Rob Gray, CEO of Cold Storage Coins™ says, “We’re partnering with some fantastic projects this year, but nothing is as unique as The Evolving Caravan. We love what the project is doing as a traveling transformational experience for entrepreneurs, and we’re honored they’re using CSC™ to spread wallet adoption”.

The Evolving Caravan offers an experiential travel immersive exploring a range of cutting-edge topics including: consciousness, human optimization and wellness, science, art, and culture, blockchain and emergent technologies. Forget stuffy workshops and seminars — “the Evolving Caravan is part mastermind, part roadtrip, part transformational retreat . . . and entirely magic.”

During the tour this summer, participants will have the opportunity to experience Cold Storage Coins™! They’ll discover how this cutting-edge wallet works and what it actually feels like to hold the value of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum in the palm of their hand. Cold Storage Coins™ will also be made able for purchase on the road, with the goal of raising awareness and larger adoption of blockchain technology.

As J from Evolving Caravan says, “Cold Storage Coins give people a tangible experience with blockchain technology in a way anyone can understand. We’re excited to have physical tokens that demonstrate the promise of blockchain technology, and hope that the industry continues to push for meaningful adoption of digital currencies in creative and effective ways.”

Cold Storage Coins™ mitigate common risks associated with storing crypto, and since their launch in February 2018, they’ve been flying off digital shelves and into the pockets of crypto enthusiasts who were craving something ultra-secure, but also collectible and cool. And like the Evolving Caravan, Cold Storage Coins’™ focus is on mass adoption of emerging and progressive ideas and technologies.

How would one go about building a bitcoin wallet for accepting payments by running a full node?,"I understand that I must run a full node in order to have a wallet service that I alone control without needing any 3rd parties. How would I go about doing that for educational purposes?
Like I would display one of my address to an user and keep monitoring that address for transactions? getbalance[account]?

How would I then know the user that I have to send the equivalent good to?

Should I display different addresses for different users and then keep track of what address I show to which user and so I can then be sure of who to send the good to?

In this case, should I monitor all such addresses for changes in balances? 

So you see my confusion, I just need some insight on how this is done! Thank you!",1529613665,21/06/2018 20:41:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8svcrh/how_would_one_go_about_building_a_bitcoin_wallet/,1

Question about mining versus verification.,"So we all understand that mining is basically a reward for verifying transactions. Don't need to get into the details of how that is achieved. What I want to know is since bitcoin price has risen and bitcoin itself is not being used on a daily basis for every day transactions and you only get the reward from mining if you are the first to solve the POW puzzle to create a new block, then doesn't that mean that bitcoin successful mining would become more scarce the more the price goes up because there are less transactions to verify therefore less opportunities to create a new block? How many transactions can be going on on a daily basis with bitcoin hitting $10k a pop and higher at times. I don't see many people walking around with $10,000 dollar bills and going and buying stuff. Seems like this would have brought successful mining efforts to a crawl.",1529621843,21/06/2018 22:57:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8swdyr/question_about_mining_versus_verification/,1

Based on confidential fraud and essential risk criteria, they may be modified at our discretion without advance notice.
• 	What transactions will this impact? ACH external transfers are electronic deposit and withdrawal transfers made between your Capital One accounts and your linked external accounts...""

So fine - new limits for ACH.
But what are they? This is never stated in the email they sent.

I call them - they DO NOT reveal the new limits to their customers.
""It's personalized for each person"" I was told.
""Then send me a personalized email with my limit"".
But that is not the policy and they will not do that.

Capital One will hold your money, and let you withdraw it, but are keeping the withdrawal via ACH limits a secret.

I'm 1/3 thru with withdrawing all funds from my Capital One accounts. Will be done with them by next week.",1529633267,22/06/2018 02:07:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sxncn/capital_one_360_shows_us_another_reason_why_we/,1

When you state your opinion / make a short- midterm price prediction saying something is bearish about bitcoin you get countless of hate.

"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.","For all *what*?

All **DEBTS**.

(Look at a dollar bill, on the front, near the upper-left corner.)

What is this saying?  It means, this is a ""general purpose IOU.""  What a **great** idea!  Bob owes Alice for the meal he just ate at her restaurant.  He gives her an IOU, but it's a general purpose IOU.  Bob got it from Duane, when Duane owed him something, and now Alice can give it to somebody else.  Excellent!

There's a problem, though.

We have a small group of people with the sole ability to create these IOUs, from thin air, by merely typing numbers into their bank computers.  Think about it: this is **theft**.  Why?  Because those bankers can use their freshly created IOUs to obtain ""stuff"" from the rest of us.  But we don't owe them anything -- they didn't give us anything, nor did they do any work for us.  They just ""take"" without our permission .  This is theft.

Here we have the ultra-rich central bankers and their cronies stealing from poor people, the middle class, the upper class,  the hard working, even the lazy.  Central bankers are thieves, thieves are criminals.

And **THIS**, boys and girls, is part of the **Beauty of Bitcoin.**

No banker, and no stupid, sociopathic politician can create Bitcoin from ""thin air"" (by merely typing numbers into a computer).  If they want to create Bitcoin, **they'll have to follow the rules** just like the rest of us -- they'll have to buy a mining rig (or a whole bunch of them), and they'll have to buy electricity, and find some way to cool the mining rigs...

When we all use Bitcoin/crypto, instead of central banker ""play money"", the criminal bankers won't be able to just type a number into a computer, then bail out some fuck face like Warren Buffet at our expense.  Buffet will go broke, like he should have a long time ago.  And the rest of us will be able to thrive better.

THis is BS and I'm screwed. What crypto tax software are you using and does it even work?,"Well this is f\*cked. The IRS has no idea how hard it is to report crypto transactions. It's literally impossible. I work in sales and do pretty well for myself, and this past year I got into crypto trading. I did a lot of it and had a few market-making bots running on a few different exchanges. Flash forward to today, I need to amend my tax return from this past year because of my crypto transactions (please don't tell me that I don't have to do this bc, yes i really do. Much more money could be at stake if I do not make a good faith effort to report my crypto activity). Because I have literally made thousands of trades, it is impossible for me to calculate my capital gains and the fair market value for every trade by hand. I am trying out [Bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax/) and [www.CryptoTrader.Tax](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/) and a few other ones to help me out, but I wanted to see what everyone else did to address this glaring problem? It's impossible bc most of the exchanges do not offer the equivalent of a 1099 that you would receive from a normal brokerage account. Any advice would be appreciated.

OKEx Launched the Digital Asset Exchange Open Partnership Program,"On 20 Jun, 2018 (Hong Kong time), OKEx officially launches the Digital Asset Exchange Open Partnership Program and begins the recruitment of “OK Partners”. By sharing the fruits of OKEx's matching system, counter system, cold wallet, hot wallet, clearing system, multilingual customer support, as well as global know-your-customer and anti-laundering system cultivated for years with our OK Partners, the program is set to nurture a new generation of digital asset exchanges characterized by high autonomy, efficiency and transparency. Aspiring teams who aim to establish their own digital asset exchanges, only need to provide their domain names, logos, operation force, and to focus on the management and operations of the exchange. OKEx's global technical team, on the other hand, will provide R&amp;D and system maintenance supports to the teams, who will share the high liquidity and advanced trading experience offered by the world-leading digital asset exchange.

The 1st phase of the program offers 100 places for participating teams. Applicants are required to deposit 500,000 OKB in their accounts, excluding the amount locked for Designated Merchant, New Listing Vote, and Prime Investors. The ideal candidates for OK Partners should possess solid industry experience, quest for service excellence, and strong industry influence. The 1st phase is expected to go online in late July. Interested parties should submit their contact person's name and phone number as well as team description to [okbd@okex.com](mailto:okbd@okex.com) for application.

More detailed information, please find on OKEx website

The company houses or has access to tons of payroll data that they can’t run the risk of compromising. 

I’m wondering if it’s possible that the comp y saw what the employee was doing and thought “hey, we have the infrastructure, why not do a little mining on the side.”

"Here is why i have faith in bitcoin, my short story.","Hey guys,
I wanted to share something many of you living in a 1st tire world countries might not relate to.
I live in Egypt ... a beautiful very old place .. with inflation rate constantly between 7% -20% for the past 40 years, and some times 35% like last year.
The value of our fiat currency with is called the Egyptian pound compared to the US dollar is as follows .. 3.8 EGP/USD in 2001 , 8.8 EGP/USD in 2016 , 17.9 EGP/USD today.
Saving money for future in our fiat currency have worked very very badly as you can tell, top 1% of our society control around 48% of the wealth, and those doesn't own fiat, they own land, gold, factories and other assets .. leaving us with the worthless fiat paper.
Freeing the exchange rate for our currency in November/2016 wiped out half the value of the fiat holdings for all the Egyptians. 

And here comes the moral of this little story, Letting the money valuation in the hand of some old stupid corrupt individuals in the government who wasted our hard earned money through their stupid selfish decisions is not right and can never work in the favor of the people, I as another 100 million Egyptians have seen and felt it.
This story is very common if you looked closely to other countries like Greek, Turkey, Bolivia, Iraq, Argentina and many countless African nations.

I believe in Bitcoin because i trust Math and logic more than i trust my government corrupted officials.
I believe in Bitcoin because i am okay with it going up or down, when knowing with my fiat there's only one way the DOWN way.

Have a nice day you all, and as always HODL :)",1529669318,22/06/2018 12:08:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8t0to0/here_is_why_i_have_faith_in_bitcoin_my_short_story/,1

Why altcoins are the best thing that could have happened to Bitcoin. Second best? Bubbles bursting and bear markets.,"Don't ridicule (too much) shitcoin zaelots, they serve a very, very real and useful purpose - Distract people and divert attention to ""*The next Bitcoin!*""

Here's the thing, Bitcoin is absolutely amazing and *will* achieve everything that has been said so often, **but**... it's not ready for global adoption. Yet. Never mind global adoption, it's not even ready for all the crypto users! Think about the blockchain bloat (or better fees) if *all* the transactions of all shitcoins combined had to happen on Bitcoin! Fees would be truly astronomical, and we're not ready for that. And the LN is also not ready for that yet.

Building the ""Internet of money"" takes time. Building it without clusterfucks takes even more time. Shitcoins provide the devs tons of breathing room.

&amp;nbsp;

Bubbles and bear markets? Same thing, scare the weak hands away. Learn to appreciate and cherish the bear market, you can also get coins for cheap(er)!

&amp;nbsp;

Disclaimer: When I say ""the best thing"" I obviously mean ""the best thing AFTER the devs working hard to build this tech AND the amazing community""!",1529673616,22/06/2018 13:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8t1a51/why_altcoins_are_the_best_thing_that_could_have/,1

It is in the format of a totally public google spreadsheet and you don't even need a google account to view and edit it. The aim of this is to create a massive pool of covered coins (comprehensively researched). You guys are welcome to take it and use it for yourselves as a template, all i would ask is that if you do in fact dedicate some time to filling in one of these properly for a token/coin then please send it back to me as i would love to create a proper store of them all for longterm perspective and market progression. enjoy guys : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfgHndiGgorpWIggjaLEGK1W6INyJCQg7V\_noVicoNY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfgHndiGgorpWIggjaLEGK1W6INyJCQg7V_noVicoNY/edit?usp=sharing)

Every time i use the legacy bank system i get reminded why Bitcoin is amazing,"- Having to go to the bank to send a wire and driving through traffic 
- Having to fill out papers
- Having to answer questions why I am sending money and where it came from
- Having to pay $20 to send my money
- Being charged 3% for currency exchange
- Having to wait 3-5 business days for money to arrive

That's in Canada. In other places like Malaysia the bank systems are even more archaic.

- Having to pay to get bank statements older than 3 months
- Having to wait 2 weeks to receive them (really!)
- Having to go to the branch to get most things done

Bitcoin removes all of these annoyances. If anyone asks why Bitcoin is worth anything... replacing these old, slow and inefficient banking systems with Bitcoin/LN is a *huge* improvement. 

And I've barely scraped the surface of what it is changing for the world's *unbanked* and other use cases where current banks are annoyingly archaic.

Here's why I think no other coin will surpass Bitcoin in relevance for the foreseeable future...,"Every up/down price wave we are seeing is also an accumulation/distribution event for Bitcoin and the other coins.

For a digital coin to actually work well as a global gold/money alternative, it should be as fairly and widely distributed as possible.

Even with almost a decade of history and a very uncertain beginning in which people literally gave away coins to everyone else for free, Bitcoin is still in the hands of barely a few million people according to most estimates.

One of the main problems of any newer coin is that, even if the new system is much more advanced than Bitcoin in terms of software capabilities (which by the way I don't think it is the case for most if not all of them), they are miles behind in the distribution of their ""coins"" and that's a huge issue because as we've seen, the most concentrated the coin possession is, the most volatile the price is because of the sudden demand/offer waves that inevitably hit the market.

And it is actually kind of a requirement for a coin to work well as money or even long term store of value to develop price stability, which gives it more usability outside the trading/speculation world and hence legitimacy in the traditional sense.

In the current market correction we're experiencing exactly that and you can see it daily in CoinMarketCap: when BTC is up 2%, 2nd coin is often up 2x that and much newer, less established coins are up 5x that amount. And the same happens when BTC is down but in the opposite way. That's a great way to make money trading/speculating but that's not usable for a mainstream store of value/medium of exchange.

Unless there is a newer coin that ""invents"" a much fairer initial distribution of coins (ICOs are in NO WAY a fair initial distribution, and let's be honest, they were designed to make money to founders and initial investors), there's no technology advancement that can accelerate the process of worldwide distribution that Bitcoin started almost a decade ago and which, in my opinion, will give it an unsurmountable advantage in the foreseeable future.",1529690609,22/06/2018 18:03:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8t3fnm/heres_why_i_think_no_other_coin_will_surpass/,1

Lightning adoption question from a noob.,"Andreas A. said there's 3 lightning products, one of which is Eclair that I've downloaded from the Android Play Store and loaded with some money. But the app warns we can only send, not receive, funds through the Lightning Network using that app (for now). 

My question is how are we transacting via Lightning if neither party can be the receiver? Before you tell me there's desktop software that allows someone to be a receiver, Lightning is supposed to be for small transactions like a cup of coffee, for example, so I expect most Lightning transactions are people on the go with their mobile phone's.

India’s RBI and Bitcoin,"Hey Folks !!

As You All Know RBI has Repeatedly Cautioned Users , Holders and Traders of Virtual Currencies , Including BITCOINS , Regarding various Risk Associated in Dealing with such Virtual Currencies on Following Dates:

December 24, 2013
February 01, 2017
December 05, 2018

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Kept on Saying that We Have Made a Committee to Analyze and Discuss the Matter of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies and Waiting for it's Report. Meanwhile RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Suddenly Sent Notices on 6th April 2018 to Exchanges and Banks About Not to Deal with Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies with Immediate Effect and Gave Three Months Time to Close the Operation.

Many Petition Were Filed Against RBI's Decision and Brought the Matter to High Court. Hight Court Simply Denied the Appeal and Said that all Such Matter Regarding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Shall be Discussed Only in Supreme Court.
Before Few Days SC (Supreme Court) also Said Banks and Appellant to Resolve the Matter at Their Level.

The Next Hearing Will Be On 20th July, 2018 in Supreme Court.

What Will Happen On 6th July?

The Crypto to Fiat Operation of Exchanges Like Zebpay , Unocoin and Other Indian Exchagnes Will Be Stopped On 6th July, But Crypto to Crypto Trading Will Be Operative.

Meanwhile Indians..!! You Guys Can Trade Your Bitcoins in Localbitcoins For These Days**

Do You Need To Worry About it?

No, Not at all.

We Have Found Something Which Needs To be Discussed Here.

A Person Named Varun Sethi Filed an RTI Against RBI On 9th May and Asked the Following Questions :

1. You( RBI) Warned People About Not to Deal In Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Several Times (Three Times ).

 Did You Make Any Committee for this ?
   
  RBI's Answer : No

2. Can You Provide us the Members Details of Committee?

   RBI's Answer : We Have Not Made and Committee so We Can Not Provide Any Details.

3.  How did You Come To Know about the Risk Associated With Bitcoins and Other Cryptocurrencies
   
  RBI's Answer:  What is Sought is Not Information as Defined  in Section 2(f) of the RTI Act 2005.
   ( According to this Act they said that Such Type of Information about Blockchain and Bitcoin, Any Evidence , Any Paper ,    Any Model or Any Electronic Material is not avaiable Online)

4. Did You Collect Any Information About Blockchain From Any Other Countries Federal Bank
   
  RBI's Answer: No

5. Did You Take Any Measures To Adopt Blockchain Technology in Banking Sector

   RBI's Answer: No

6. Does These Rules and Regulations Apply on State Bank of Sikkim?

   RBI's Answer: State Bank of Sikkim Comes Under Us But We did not Provide any Notice to them

Can You Guys Look at the Answers of RBI. 
They did make the decision Without Any Adequate Reserach Which is Merely Speculative one.
We Belive that Cryptocurrencies are More likely to be Regulated Instead of Ban.
Regulations do Require Comprehensive Sets of Rules Which Requires Some time too.
Whithin Few Months or May be Few Years it will Be Regulated in India.

Taiwan’s Financial Regulator to Conduct Limited Oversight of Cryptocurrencies,"**The Financial Supervisory Commission of Taiwan has indicated its intentions to maintain only a limited oversight of cryptocurrencies. The regulator said it’s going to focus mainly on the enforcement of anti-money laundering policies, while remaining open towards innovations like those coming from the crypto sector.**

***Also read:*** [***Bitcoin Businesses Denied Banking Services in Ireland***](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-businesses-denied-banking-services-in-ireland/)

## Not Stifling Innovation

📷With the executive power in Taipei still mulling over new regulations for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), representatives of Taiwan’s financial regulator indicated their unwillingness to slow down progress in the fintech industry. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will mainly focus on one of its core duties – overseeing the enforcement of anti-money laundering policies, and will continue to welcome innovations that come with digital currencies.

During a press conference on Thursday, Banking Bureau Deputy Director Sherri Chuang said the FSC prefers to monitor developments and avoid stifling early-stage growth. Quoted by *The* *Taipei Times*, she emphasized:

&gt;***The commission maintains an open stance and welcomes all industry innovations.***

Chuang also noted that cryptocurrencies, and the tokens issued through ICOs, which are classified as commodities at this stage, do not currently fall under the commission’s jurisdiction. The regulator is only involved in preventing money laundering through virtual assets, the official reiterated before the media. Sherri Chuang compared the situation with that of the lease finance companies, where the involvement of the regulator is also limited to money laundering prevention.

📷According to another representative of the commission, Securities and Futures Bureau Chief Secretary Chien Hung-ming, ICOs do not cross any regulatory red lines in Taiwan. He explained that each coin offering would be assessed on a case-by-case basis, noting that regulators are primarily concerned with examining the fundraising prospects of the respective token sale.

The FSC will assess each issuance to determine if the digital coin should be classified as a security or a virtual commodity, Chien added. “It is very difficult to define broadly, as each case is different,” the FSC official pointed out.

## Not Following China

The Executive Yuan, or the Taiwanese government, has yet to develop and adopt comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. In April, high-ranking officials indicated that the respective legislative framework should be developed and introduced by November, 2018, as news.Bitcoin.com [reported](https://news.bitcoin.com/taiwanese-bitcoin-regulations-expected-november-2018/).

According to a statement by Taiwan’s Justice Minister, Qiu Taisan, the government intends to task the FSC with developing the regulatory system for digital currencies. The Ministry of the Interior, the Investigation Bureau, and the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) are expected to assist the commission.

Although cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been increasingly mentioned as a subject of concern, mainly in the light of money laundering, Taiwan is not likely to severely restrict them. Last year the chairman of the FSC, Wellington Koo, confirmed that the country would not adopt a prohibitive regulatory framework like the one implemented in China.

Earlier in April, Taiwan’s Central Bank [signaled](https://news.bitcoin.com/taiwan-to-regulate-bitcoin-under-anti-money-laundering-laws/) it would favor regulating cryptocurrencies under the country’s existing anti-money laundering laws. Its new governor, Yang Chin-long, suggested that the Ministry of Justice should include bitcoin in the scope of ROC’s Money Laundering Control Act.

Btc death by thousand cuts,"Not the most popular title for this reddit but i’ve been following the conversation here and i can’t believe how much ignorance in one place. 
Seriously, fiat is not great, but talking about zero fee transactions and inflation protection using a coin that has guaranteed inflation (limited supply) and 20% daily fluctuations is as stupid as it gets. 
I bought coffee with btc. Today that btc would have bought me a car. Inflation in your face (and i’m not comparing to fiat. I’m comparing to coffee and car).
A few months ago i wired some eth. By the time the other side got it (under a minute) it was worth $50 more. So i lost $50 in one minute buying a stupid coffee grinder. 
Lost coins = inflation. 
Stolen coins = no insurance. Irreversible even if you can prove it. Hard forks don’t scale beyond one every few years so stolen coins are forever. 
What you are seeing is ppl start realizing it was always a nice idea but full of scammers and opportunists who tried to make a killing in a pyramid scheme. I know some of them personally. But at the end of the day its no better than fiat. Its just different.

Who is left in the market today?,"**Who owns Bitcoin today?**   

We know there was a massive transfer of wealth in December and January.  But honestly.  **Who owns crypto today?**

I’ve been in Bitcoin since February 2015, and bought my first Bitcoin for $227.  I then told all my friends to buy Bitcoin and get on.  No one listened until we hit about $2500 in the summer of 2017.  Then everyone was calling me and asking me how to get in on this.  Many of my friends got in.  

Now my friends have no idea how the blockchain works or anything and were just trying to make money.  They do not resemble how our community looked back before 2017 *(although maybe closer to how it looks today)*

Anyways, all my newbie friends, now in mid 2018, don’t love Bitcoin as much.  But they fall into two camps.  

1. Guys that sold off.  The ones that got in around $2000, mostly sold off around the $8000 to $12,000 range and all super happy.  But they’re out and thank me all the time.  They love seeing the price drop and are thinking about getting in, if it keeps going down and stops dropping 10&amp;#37; in one day.  
2. Others believe in it after seeing December and are holding, and hoping for a repeat of December 2017 or believe Bitcoin is the future.  These guys are holding They won’t be selling unless we skyrocket or they just see it as a crazy gamble and enjoy it *(but not so much lately)*

This comes to my point.  To me, with Bitcoin sitting at $6000.  I find it super hard to see any retail investor outside of these two camps.  I mean the guys like me that have been in since 2015 sold some *(I started selling at $2500)* but probably still hold some like me as well because we believe in the project plus the very real opportunity that this will jump to $85,000 or higher come 2020.  

But … my question is this.    **WHO IS SELLING ?**

Who is in Bitcoin today, and seen the price just get destroyed, and now they are like…. *“Now I will sell at $6000”* …. uh .. what?  You had six months to sell, why now finally?

Please explain this to me.  I just feel like anyone who wanted to get out is out.  The guys in now are the holders or the believers or the day traders.  Or they're brand new.  

I just don’t see anyone in, who is saying, *“well, if we hit $4500, I’m gone”*, but I do know a lot of people saying *“if we hit $4500, I am coming back in”* or they are getting in now.  

The other thing is this.  With all the media, start ups, ICOs, etc etc.  This crypto space is so much bigger than it was last summer.  We're only up 300&amp;#37; in a year?  How is that possible?  Binance has gone from 2m to 9m customers just in 2018.  I mean that is 450&amp;#37; growth.    


**Maybe I am living in a bubble.**  

So is the market just so manipulated by one or two massive whales nothing I am saying matters?  

Or am I just wishful thinking and we're headed back to $227 when I started?",1529730470,23/06/2018 05:07:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8t7quo/who_is_left_in_the_market_today/,1

"""Opportunity Zones"" - New way to defer capital gain tax on cryptocurrency - Invest in Detroit!","This new ""Opportunity Zones"" program allows for the creation of ""Opportunity Funds"" where capital gains tax can be deferred.  These funds can be used to buy and develop real estate and capital improvements in areas identified within the zone. 

I have a deep understanding of the Detroit real estate market and I am interested in managing an opportunity fund here in Detroit. Does this sound interesting to anyone? I figured maybe there are some people on here that hit it big with bitcoin and would like to sell some and avoid paying taxes.

A large portion of the City of Detroit is included within the opportunity zone and with the recent news of Ford's acquisition and renovation of the Michigan Central Station there is a lot of opportunity in Detroit.

 [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/opportunity-zones-frequently-asked-questions)

## Q. What is an Opportunity Zone?

A. An Opportunity Zone is an economically-distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. Localities qualify as Opportunity Zones if they have been nominated for that designation by the state and that nomination has been certified by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury via his delegation authority to the Internal Revenue Service.

## Q. Who created Opportunity Zones?

A. Opportunity Zones were added to the tax code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.

## Q. Have Opportunity Zones been around a long time?

A. No, they are new. The first set of Opportunity Zones, covering parts of 18 states, were designated on April 9, 2018.

## Q. What is the purpose of Opportunity Zones?

A. Opportunity Zones are an economic development tool—that is, they are designed to spur economic development and job creation in distressed communities.

## Q. How do Opportunity Zones spur economic development?

A. Opportunity Zones are designed to spur economic development by providing tax benefits to investors. First, investors can defer tax on any prior gains until the earlier of the date on which an investment is sold or exchanged, or December 31, 2026, so long as the gain is reinvested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund. Second, if the investor holds the investment in the Opportunity Fund for at least ten years, the investor would be eligible for an increase in basis equal to the fair market value of the investment on the date that the investment is sold or exchanged.

## Q. What is a Qualified Opportunity Fund

A. Qualified Opportunity Fund is an investment vehicle that is set up as either a partnership or corporation for investing in eligible property that is located in an Opportunity Zone and that utilizes the investor’s gains from a prior investment for funding the Opportunity Fund.

## Q. Do I need to live in an Opportunity Zone to take advantage of the tax benefits?

A. No. You can get the tax benefits, even if you don’t live, work or have a business in an Opportunity Zone. All you need to do is invest in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.

## Q. I am interested in investing in an Opportunity Zone. Is there a list of Opportunity Zones available?

A. Yes. The current list of approved Opportunity Zones can be found at [Opportunity Zones Resources](https://www.cdfifund.gov/Pages/Opportunity-Zones.aspx). This list will continue to be updated as more Opportunity Zones are approved. A complete list of approved Opportunity Zones will be published later this spring after all Opportunity Zones have been nominated, certified and designated.

## Q. How does a taxpayer become certified as a Qualified Opportunity Fund?

A. To become a Qualified Opportunity Fund, an eligible taxpayer self certifies.  (Thus, no approval or action by the IRS is required.)  To self-certify, a taxpayer merely completes a form (which will be released in the summer of 2018) and attaches that form to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return for the taxable year.  (The return must be filed timely, taking extensions into account.)

## Q.  I sold some stock for a gain in 2018, and, during the 180-day period beginning on the date of the sale, I invested the amount of the gain in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.  Can I defer paying tax on that gain?

A. Yes, under § 1400Z-2(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, you may elect to defer the tax on some or all of that gain.  If, during the 180-day period, you had invested in one or more Qualified Opportunity Funds only an amount that was less than your entire gain, you may still elect to defer paying tax on part of the gain, up to the amount that you invested in that way.

## Q. How do I elect to defer my gain on the sale of the stock?

A.  You may make an election to defer the gain, in whole or in part, when filing your 2018 Federal Income Tax return in 2019 (that is, you may make the election on the return on which the tax on that gain would be due if you do not defer it). 

## Q. I sold some stock on December 15, 2017, and, during the required 180-day period, I invested the amount of the gain in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.  Can I elect to defer tax on that gain?

A. Yes, as long as it was invested in the 180-day period, under § 1400Z-2(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, you may elect to defer the tax on that gain.  A deferral election may be made on your 2017 Federal Income Tax return.  Information about the sale of your stock is required to be included in that return using IRS Form 8949.  Precise instructions on how to use that form to elect deferral of the gain for your 2017 return will be forthcoming shortly. 

## Q. Can I still elect to defer tax on that gain if I have already filed my 2017 tax return?

A. Yes.  You may elect to defer the gain, but you will need to file an amended 2017 return.  As part of that amended return, you will follow the election procedure described in the answer to the preceding question.",1529730900,23/06/2018 05:15:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8t7s59/opportunity_zones_new_way_to_defer_capital_gain/,1

Farce in the USA; adoption hindered by lack of practical legislation.,"I’d like to highlight something that Andreas A raised in his speech at the 5 year let’s talk bitcoin anniversary show.

He pointed out that he is paying his tax accountant more than he pays the IRS in actual tax. This is because of ridiculous requirement to file multi page documents in relation to each purchase or payment he makes in bitcoin.

This issue is a major stumbling block that severely penalizes law abiding citizens of the USA and like minded countries.  Only wealthy Americans (I define this as those who can afford to buy and hold for the long term) will be able to participate. As it stands the great unbanked living in the third world are going to inherit the wealth that comes with this new tech and the middle class and below in the USA will not. The USA as a country will lose out economically to its Asian rivals who have opened the floodgates.

The USA needs to introduce laws swiftly around discretionary spending in bitcoin. They Japan and Australia who have already introduced such measures.

Please upvote this thread to get this point heard. It is in my view one of the biggest hurdles to bitcoin adoption in many first world countries. It is not transaction fees or speed that is the major issue anymore.

If you agree please retweet on other social media wherever possible.",1529737404,23/06/2018 07:03:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8t89mi/farce_in_the_usa_adoption_hindered_by_lack_of/,1

Token economy and smart contract are not related to public blockchain,"In my last article, I have argued that the public blockchain is a contradiction in its own proposition.  Nevertheless, to avoid the argument that arguments are abstract and theoretical and may not be the same as reality  As a detailed example, I will explain why the two publicly known blockbusters known as the changes in the future society are not related to the public blockchain. •Token economy  The benefit of a public blockchain is 'enhanced security'.  It is also possible in private blockchain.  Securing in a private block chain means that a single entity (enterprise, foundation) can release tokens that are not double-paid.  It can be implemented in a private block chain of any type that the public block chiners imagine, whether it be a payment token, a utility token, or a platform token.  This proves that the token economy is not only available in public blockchain.  In a public blockchain, however, you may argue that tokens are not only gift certificates, but also represent ownership.  A certificate representing ownership is a security.  Tokens with securities functions are just securities, and tokens with gift certificates only are mileage or electronic gift certificates.  The unique thing about the token market in public block chains is that there are many tokens that combine those two functions.  It is a securities, it can be used as a gift certificate, or a gift certificate. It is also used as a securities.  Except for the fact that you can still do it without a blockchain,  What economic benefits do it have to put the gift certificates and securities functions in one voucher?  Would not it be better to distribute gift certificates to shareholders holding securities or to distribute securities to those who purchased the product?  No one is wondering why we should combine those two functions.  The more tokens with many functions, the more valuable they are, so you just put them together.  Even if a new certificate combining securities and gift certificates yields better economic results, it can not be said to be unique in the blockchain technology.  It means that the person working in the blockchain industry has created a new economic system, not a block chain. •Smart contract  Dapp is software that is built on this smart contract, so I will define it essentially the same.  Smart contract is an irreversible contract that anyone can create on a block chain.  Now, using centralized services, these features are now everywhere!  The key to the definition of smart contracts is the 'irreversible contract' that anyone can make.  Anyone can create and publish apps in the App Store.  We do e-commerce, which is an 'electronic contract', on a centralized server.  The irreversible contract that we are not able to do with the 'irreversible' contract is (usually) illegal, so the platform we use is providing reversible services!  Demand for irreversible contracts can be absorbed by centralized services. •conclusion  Smart contracts are already commercialized for centralized services, and the token economy is an economic model that can exist independently of technology.",1529755874,23/06/2018 12:11:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8t9j9c/token_economy_and_smart_contract_are_not_related/,1

Bitfinex executive leaves company,"According to Reuters reporting, Phil Potter, chief strategy officer, has left Bitfinex. Potter was quoted as saying this had to do with Bitfinex moving away from the US market as he is based within the US. 

I would argue this is one more reason why Bitfinex should reconsider opening to US customers. The regulatory impact of not serving US customers is small as the US will get jurisdiction if they are involved in big enough shenanigans but are excluding what is by far the largest segment of the market.

Why not enter a short contract instead of just hodl?,"This post is inspired by The Big Short. Scenario: you believe Bitcoin will be worth more dollars in 6 months and you plan to hodl for at least that long. I believe it will go down to 5k. We enter an agreement, I borrow your coins and have to give them back to you in 6 months, plus $200. I sell the coins now for $6k and buy them back in 6 months. If they cost less than 5.8k then, I make a profit. Either way, you were going to hodl on, but this way, you also win $200 after 6 months.

Is there a platform for doing this, that enforces the contract? Can it be done by using Bitcoin's properties alone? If trust wouldn't be a problem,  what are your reasons for not going this route?",1529773273,23/06/2018 17:01:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tbalf/why_not_enter_a_short_contract_instead_of_just/,1

What happened to this community?,"I got into bitcoin exactly a year ago after reading intriguing articles about how the technology is disruptive and that it can give the money and power back to the people and that it’s a one world currency. There was so much excitement about how it can over throw evil banks and governments and even stop wars. There were libertarians,  anarchist, programmers, etc. with many different views and posts everyday on interesting articles whether it’s political, financial, speculative, educational, or on new developments, etc. where did they all go? It seems like every post on this sub is talking about prices and trolls calling for $5 bitcoins. And it seems like people are seeking government regulations on crypto? But wasn’t the whole point of crypto to over throw those centralized entities that control the money who ultimately control the world? What has changed? What did i miss? Where all those smart people go? Was it all a giant scam to lure people in and they cashed out? Or is this just a natural way of a bear market and how it effects the community? Im confused af.

Does anyone know who Coinbase's Agent for Service of Process is? Where do I serve them court papers?,"Well, I accidentally sent 6 BCH to a BTC Coinbase address in August, 2017. They said in their mass email (and it even still states in their FAQ) that BCH accidentally sent to a BTC address after the fork but before they opened up their platform to BCH would be credited to the associated accounts. They never credited me.

I opened a support request LONG AGO, shortly after they opened their platform to BCH, indicating that I was never credited for my BCH. They've avoided dealing with it ever since. They told me they'd research it and get back to me, after which they silently closed my support ticket without notifying me, and have since told me on several occasions that they are aware of the issue and will have a specialist research it. I would hope that a specialist could figure this out in, I don't know, 5 minutes. I mean, it took me 10 minutes to figure it out. Everything is right there on the public ledger... BCH going to the address associated with my wallet.

It has been more than 6 months. Still nothing. I'm now trying to sue them for it, but I don't know who I need to have served because they will not tell me who their agent of service is. Does anyone know this information? Should I just list their corporate address for serving the court documents?

I can't imagine this is going to go over well for them when I finally have my day in court... and yet, they're still super uncooperative and are clearly not interested in giving me back the money that is rightfully mine.

Would you sell your unused bandwidth for bitcoin?,"If you could have a box that would offer wireless access to your Internet to people passing by, and took payment in bitcoin, how much would you charge? If you have a cellular data plan that you never max out, same question: would you offer your hotspot facilities for crypto? Your unused bandwidth becomes a revenue stream. Assume for the moment that they VPN back to their *own* box before reaching the Internet so accessing dodgy material is not a factor.

A VERY bearish outlook. Hear me out.,"Whats up guys. Let me start this off by saying I'm incredibly bullish in the long term, I truly believe in blockchain technology and it's immensely useful application in all aspects of society.

I have been thinking about this for a while, now i'm finally putting it to words. We all hope deeply that Bitcoin and all other assets in the market bring us great wealth in the future, of course. We all know how incredible this revolution is, and we (generally), consider ourselves early investors into something great. What i'm saying here isnt my personal outlook necessarily, I just think its an important perspective for all of us to have in the background during all of this as I think it is moderately a possibility.

Now here's a theory of mine...For the most part, we take this market day-by-day, constant daily analysis' predicting the next ""bull run"". I feel as though bears in this space are constantly ridiculed because of the false hope that the perma-bulls have, based on nothing really except alot of people to agree with them. What if we're all just holding onto nothing? Bitcoin saw an absolutely fu*king insane run in 2017, fueled by absolute exuberance and greed, as most markets are.

Bitcoin just about touched 20k, now we're down to the low 6k level. Most everyone here has seen that chart that labels ""denial"", ""disbelief"", ""fear, and ""despair"" all throughout the market cycle. What if the big money guys are pulling this down farther than any of us are prepared for? Most of us are looking for any sign of life in this market, and so many people FOMO at the sight of a green candle. The major market movers could so easily just play with our emotions all the way down to the hundreds, its VERY unlikely that we will see those kinds of levels IMO, but I really don't want you guys to rule the possibility out.

Bitcoin is a bubble, it just is. I do not by any means believe 20k was the highest we will ever see it, no, but to deny that Bitcoin is one massive bubble is just ignorance...We've all heard of the tulip bubble so many years ago, and yes this one is very different as there is an actual use case and a massive revolution of technology and innovation behind it, but we're so damn early in this that it could so easily replicate that.

I know a lot of you are thinking as you're reading this, ""Bitcoin has no reason to go lower than the cost of mining it"", and you're very likely right, but again, anything is possible.

I know i'm kind of all over the place here, i'd love to talk to you guys in the comments and hear your opinions.",1529788135,23/06/2018 21:08:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tcyrg/a_very_bearish_outlook_hear_me_out/,1

So, what happens when consistently worldwide the cost of the electricity to mine one Bitcoin costs more than one is worth? I saw aanotop (Andreas Antonopoulos) speak in the flesh recently and he said as long as electricity is renewable, there isn't an issue. Does that sound right? Am I missing anything basic here or does there come a point when it is not worthwhile to mine Bitcoin?

NiceHash Review: Bitcoin Cloud Mining,"## NiceHash Review: Bitcoin Cloud Mining

Renting hashing power online is a great way to start mining cryptocurrencies without having to make the investment in mining equipment. So which one ranks among the most [trusted cloud mining sites](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864)?

This site allows you to buy hashing power for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Dash, Zcash, Litecoin and other coins and get paid in bitcoin. There's no contracts so if mining doesn't turn a profit for you, you can immediately stop your investment.

[NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864) has real miners who use their own mining equipment which is connected to the site's multipool so you'll never have to worry if the mining equipment actually exists.

### Buy and Sell Hashing Power‎

So if you want to start cryptocurrency mining but you've been hesitant because of shady cloud mining services, this is the solution that you've been looking for.

You'll get access to a host of user-friendly features for buyers including:

A minimum order price of 0.005 Bitcoin for every algorithm  
No contracts, no risk. You may cancel at any time without a cancellation fee  
Only pay only for valid shares  
Mine on any pool you want, when you want  
Get access to real-time statistics &amp; dashboard

The best part about cloud mining sites is that unlike actual bitcoin mining, you don't have to spend weeks learning about mining hardware and software in order to get everything set up. In fact, with this site you can actually be up and running in just a few minutes.

Getting started in this site is easy. All you need to do is:

1. Register a new account and deposit BTC.  
2. Add the mining pool you want to direct your purchased hashing power to.  
3. Set the fixed price or bid for mining and then create a new order.  
4. Monitor your order on the marketplace.

Another reason to consider cryptocurrency cloud mining is the fact that you can time your entry so that you can make the most of your investments. Getting in on cryptocurrency cloud mining while bitcoin prices are low means better returns later on versus having to invest in expensive mining hardware upfront.

So if you just want to learn how it works and place some initial orders, you can sign up for free to check it out for yourself.

[Click here](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864) to join and you'll also get a free guide to buying hashing power with tips on efficient mining. ",1529794785,23/06/2018 22:59:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tdnn7/nicehash_review_bitcoin_cloud_mining/,1

"Winter in the bitcoin beanstalk forest, an analogy of the current market"," As the price continues to tumble; I'm sure many of the newcomers are beginning to question the legitimacy of this project. If we view bitcoin as a traditional stock or currency which I believe the majority of newcomers are; then of course, a 66&amp;#37; loss is unacceptable and borderline fraudulent. However, I am here to remind you that bitcoin is neither a traditional currency, stock, security or any previous asset class we have seen, which is reason for it's volatility. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is only 10 years old and is the FIRST of it's kind to exist. 

Let us use the analogy of magic beans from Jack and the beanstalk to represent bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto as the mysterious bean wizard. This seemly normal bean planted a decade ago has now grown into an anomaly; attracting a large crowd of onlookers who are trying to decide if the beans are truly magic.

Most are watching from the sidelines; trying to decide if these beans are really magic or just a charlatans trick. They are watching other's buy and sell, not actively participating yet still curious and paying attention. The beanstalk has captured the attention of the MSM and all kinds of financial gurus are pitching their pitches for what this strange plant really is. 

Some have purchased many of these beans without questioning the magic and validity behind the beans, seeing as how quickly they grew in the months prior. When the beans failed to grow as quickly as they expected and even shrunk, they dismissed the wizard's magic as quickly as they believed him and labeled both the wizard and the beanstalk a phony. They do not care about the magic behind the beans, but the treasures inside the castle in the sky which the beanstalk will take them too when it becomes sufficiently strong and powerful. 

The true HODLers, early adopters, libertarians and cypherpunks are those who bought and planted the magic beans from the mysterious internet wizard with promises that the beans will someday grow strong roots and take them to the utopia in the clouds. Skeptical at first, they studied the magic behind the beans to better understand how it works. Some from this group have even learned how to read the spells written by the magic internet wizard and are writing their own spells to improve and help the beanstalk grow.  For them, bitcoin truly is this generation's magic beans, they understand it will not happen overnight yet they are confident in its success. It is a matter of ""when"" not ""if"". 

Currently the beanstalk is not growing but the magic behind it IS and it remains unaffected. Hash rates are increasing, lightning network continues to expand, more wallets are being created and exchange volumes are many times what they were a year ago. If you look at the logarithmic growth of bitcoin since inception, it has been on a steady incline, only when you zoom in do you see the bumps. 

The beanstalk has even grown large enough that it is no longer a single stump and has several branches now, all moving in different directions but towards the same destination. What's more surprising is that the beanstalk has even spawned seeds, creating a forest of similar magic beanstalks, each with their own magic spells; some weaker and some stronger. 

Right now it is winter in the magic beanstalk forest. The work of the mysterious internet wizard is done, the seed has been planted. The believers are doing their best to learn magic and help the beanstalk grow. The newcomers are trying to figure out why their beans aren't growing in winter and may be angry for believing in the mysterious internet wizard for promising them riches beyond belief. The widowed mother will never believe in the magic of these beans until they have reached the clouds while the onlookers grow increasingly in numbers and curiosity. Which one are you?

Can bitcoin ever become a viable currency?,"So I'm a longtime lurker considering buying. I know its a weird time to buy but I don't care about trying to time it perfectly, I just want in. But I really need to  believe in its potential as a legitimate currency before I buy-- I feel like too many people just buy because they think the price is going to go up.

Here's the thing for me: imagine a society where everyone only used bitcoin. If the network is as anonymous as I understand it to be, we (as individuals or as businesses) could simply not pay taxes and never get caught. The government would collect zero dollars in tax revenues, right? 

Thus, I don't see a possible world where the governments ever let bitcoin exist as a functional currency. Governments could easily ban businesses from accepting bitcoin payments and that would prevent bitcoin from ever being a commonplace currency. Change my mind and I'll start investing.",1529809302,24/06/2018 03:01:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tf024/can_bitcoin_ever_become_a_viable_currency/,1

Question about Coinbase,"So I decided to buy bitcoin through Coinbase since it's about the only one I could find operating in my area. I've been watching the price of bitcoin fluctuate and when it goes up Coinbase says that the amount of bitcoin I have goes down in value.

Ex: 0.0016=$9.99 when btc price is something like $6,098 but when the price goes to $6,174 Coinbase says 0.0016=$9.89. (These aren't accurate numbers just a way to show you what I mean.) 

So basically am I getting worked up because I'm misreading or am I actually going to lose money as the price goes up? I know you guys said it'd grow as btc price went up but this says different so I'm just curious.

Coinbase is failing in 2018,"Coinbase is failing at every aspect of their business in 2018.

They have not attracted any real ""institutional money"". They have maintained absolutely unreal fees. They bully everyone else in the market. They block transactions from organizations they do not like (wiki, ect). They are bad for crypto and a terrible company. Crypto will not succeed with coinbase at the helm. They have shown they can not adapt to a changing marketplace. Instead focusing on hiring females for high level positions instead of focusing on the actual business they provide. They have not reinvested the money they made from last year with fees. They seem want to extract as much money as possible from the crypto markets and don't care if its successful or not.

Coinbase doesn't care about adoption or crypto long term. They only care about making money through fees. Boycott Coinbase please. Use Square (Cash App) instead. Fees are less, its a polished system and have a pubiclly traded company. Everything Coinbase does is secretive like they have some kind of mystique. Stop the bs Coinbase.

TIL about crypto,"Most ""crypto personalities"" or crypto institutions don't give a flying fuck about the actual assets. They only want as many USD as they can get. Or charge the highest amounts of fees and still having people use them. (Excluding Binance). All these blow hards are confidence people. Pumping up shit that will never happen. Funny thing is, NO ONE HOLDS THEM ACCOUNTABLE. You think people like Mike Novogratz give a flying fuck about the actual concept of what bitcoin is? No. He sees a quick billion he can make and move on to the next venture start ups that fail over and over again. None of these people have real passion for the actual assets. Novogratz is probably the one dumping hard at midnight. Laughing while doing it. Then in a couple weeks China will legalize crypto and everything back green. THESE PEOPLE KNOW THE INSIDE INFORMATION. THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHEN TO BUY WHEN TO SELL TO GET OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE FUD HITS. IT'S A GAME. WE ARE ALL BEING PLAYED. YOU DON'T THINK THE BITIFINEX STORY WAS PLANNED ON FRIDAY???

thinking about saying goodbye to my lambo,"Well here is my story:

\- had a good mining operation going on between 2012-2015, which gathered over 17 btc in total.

\- sold about 13 at the average price of over $1000 during 2013-14 run and bought a car (obviously not a lambo)

\- in 2015 everything I had (\~4btc) was put in a cold storage and I vowed to never touch them until it hits &gt;$100k

\- last month I got into a DUI crash and totaled the same car I bought in 2014, and I did not have an adequate insurance.

\- shelled 2btc for a another car and criminal attorney.

So basically now I have 1.92btc left and 10k in CC-debt, which recently started charging 17&amp;#37; ARP. I do have a job, but I also have 2 kids and looming lawyer costs for DUI case and separate immigration case. And thus my dilemma is:

\--- should I sell btc to close the CC, and slowly buy with my extra cash on a monthly basis? or should I don't touch btc and keep paying the CC interest? The latter option would be well worth if the price recovers in a year. But I've been through number of ups-and-downs, and I just don't ""feel"" like we would reach the highs anytime soon.

Please give me strength to hodl and enlighten me on how should I keep my lambo dream alive.",1529827612,24/06/2018 08:06:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tgfzh/thinking_about_saying_goodbye_to_my_lambo/,1

What if,"This entire crypto experiment was a scheme to bleed out the middle class further. Giving people hope of maybe paying off loans, buying a house, a car. In return it was a way for the whales to pump in, pump out. Then as the real market hits a recession, it's literally communism. Haves and half nots. Rothchilds, Rockefellers, Soros, Novogratz, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Gates, ect, ect, other extremely rich people who act like they endorse crypto then actually crash it because they have no soul and will prostitute their mom to get more money more $USD.

Trezor and privacy,"Hi All,

Maybe someone can help me out.

I have a Trezor. Now, I have my private seed safe, which I like.

However:

My privacy is not safe. Because when I use the Trezor Wallet, my local browser is connecting the (bitcore) servers of Trezor. So my public key's are exploted.  So I am not using my own trustable Bitcoin full node.

I tried to install my own Bitcore server, but I can not get that worked.

I tried to run Etherum Personal Server (EPS) to connect Etherum to. In Etherum I can use my Trezor. That works. But i do not like this, because it is a difficult setup. Also EPS is in beta.

I have three questions:

1. Is it true that when I use the Trezor Wallet, Trezor will know my transaction history and public addresses I am watching?
2. Is there another way I can solve this?
3. Ehm.... am I the only one having this problem? Are my expectations to high? I expect, when I buy a product like Trezor, it will be totally safe, using the strengths of Bitcoin and so it is possible with this product to use my own full node.  Is it strange when I say this is not a mature part of bitcoin (having the private key in a hardware wallet and using your own bitcoin full node)

It looks like I better can use the official bitcoin wallet (bitcoin-qt) because that one I can trust and throw away my Trezor.  I understood it is a HD wallet.

Correcting a misconception: The cost of electricity to mine a bitcoin does not create a bottom for the price,"I've seen a lot of people repeat the myth that the cost of the electricity to mine a bitcoin creates a natural floor for the coin's price. In light of the rapid loss of value and there being nothing to stop this from continuing, I wanted to make sure that everyone who is holding the coin is aware of this so that they at least have a proper investment thesis formulated.

The basic idea falls under the Labor Theory of Value, however this theory is a fallacy and does not hold up under market dynamics. Just because a person spends a lot of time or resources creating an object, does not mean that that object has value on the market.

The Iceberg hodl,"The book Pimp teaches you a lot about capitalism. How ruthless these free markets can be. Sometimes when you have it too good the market will break you. It will remind you are not in charge of the market.

Iceberg Slim talks about breaking a woman, which I think is an appropriate analogy. He writes about sometimes having to manipulate people to the point of beating them. Then after the beating he would run them a bath and give them pills too make them feel better. The recipient would be so grateful for the bath and medication, aka feeling better. That they would forget that it was Iceberg who beat them to begin with.

In this market it feels like you've been beat up. Have no fear, bitcoin is waiting to run you a bath and give you your fix. You will forget it was bitcoin who beat you to begin with. It's the way of free market. As brutal as that sounds it will get better.",1529845727,24/06/2018 13:08:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8thosv/the_iceberg_hodl/,1

What does it mean when someone says they are involved with bitcoin for the technology?,"Someone who is in it for the tech is someone who runs at least one node. Someone who is actively involved in testing new layer developments. It's someone who watches presentations by the top devs and gets excited when they hear about atomic swaps, schnorr signatures, and lightning network. it's someone who seeks knowledge and understanding of all the pieces that makes bitcoin work. It's someone who sees bitcoin as a hobby rather than an investment vehicle. It's through this knowledge and drive to understand that makes one realize fiat conversion rates mean nothing. The tech development doesn't care about price. The top devs certainly don't care. Do you think brilliant devs who sacrifice everything for bitcoin improvements like Dr. Wuille care about price?

Sad but true.,"The majority of people around the world don't really 'get' bitcoin, or understand the 'ramifications'. They don't properly grasp the thought of bitcoin is here to stay, an't be stopped and that more blockchain inventions and evolution will be integrated into most things, that most people will be using bitcoin in the future whether they like it or not.     
      
Up to now most are just using it for speculation, or to get rich or at least just make some profit.

"BTC is being used for everyday purchases, how will tax be taken then?","How will BTC be a traceable and taxable income? If I pay a merchant with cash, there is of course a loop hole (here in the UK at least) that the merchant can not declare the cash and have tax free profit.

Will this be the same with bitcoin?   
Will tax on bitcoin have to be paid in bitcoin?  
Will there be VAT on bitcoin purchases?

All these questions, that, although BTC shows potential and is migrating more and more into every day lives, will it cause another ""credit bubble"" of sorts and end up causing the next inflationary crash cycle?

If BTC is a unified currency and I can trade in China paying for my items in BTC, this will also remove the need for currency exchanging (across some of the minors anyway) and would then effect the economy as a whole. How would interest rates work if we are unified in paying with BTC?

Interesting stages are to come with this and it could be very great or be a massive downfall in global economy. It could make redundant all of the Central Banks's efforts of QE...

Just a thought.

How will merchants and online businesses that accept bitcoin adapt to ever-changing and vague crypto laws?,"I am quite worried about the adaptation of bitcoin when it comes to regulation. It seems everyone is focused on scalability. Scalability is becoming less and less of a problem. Every day people are making new coins and upgrading current ones to adapt to a bigger market. No one, however, seems to be focused on regulation in the crypto market. Currently, many businesses and merchants are hesitant about accepting crypto because of how vague the laws are. This is not just a problem in the US, many countries have either made vague laws or even no laws about crypto. It is very expensive to find attornies and other professionals that specialize in crypto-related matters. I and many others are also confused about taxes in the crypto market. It is very confusing and risky at this time. Are people going to be taxed when they sell out or when they buy? What if people never sell out and just keep their money in crypto? There is no way for governments to tax crypto if it remains in their wallets. Online businesses and merchants accepting crypto could possibly be fined or prosecuted if they do not comply with extremely vague and confusing policies. I would hate to see another person like Charlie Sherm be arrested just because they dared to pioneer and risk everything to make a life-changing technology more accessible.",1529866739,24/06/2018 18:58:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tjzf9/how_will_merchants_and_online_businesses_that/,1

Why isn't there any talk about government/IMF/worldbank involvement?,"I understand a lot of people who bought or are interested in bitcoin, find the less exciting problems and caveats boring and dull, and this exactly where the government grabs you by the nuts, on the blissful ignorance who graduated magna cum lauda from the school of ""Where's My Lambo"".

Have you noticed?
Bitcoin price starts dwindelling a week after CBOE started to launch their first 1btc contract and then after a week the CME started offering 5 btc contracts. The not so smart group of early bitcoin enthusiasts who held hundreds or even thousands of bitcoins succumbed to the oldest capital market trick: asset base warping thrpugh future contracts.

Its been done on the LIBOR spot price (this rate acts as a benchmark that determines future value of long term investments such as pension returns/actuaries and many other financial vehicles):
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/libor-scandal-the-bankers-who-fixed-the-worlds-most-important-number

Its been done on Gold:
https://www.reuters.com/article/gold-fix-idUSL5N0KR2U620140117

Even when OIL has a cartel to ""protect"" suppliers and buyers, warping happens there too:
https://www.nasdaq.com/article/how-crude-oil-traders-manipulate-the-market-cm255276

The list can go on. This is one of the main reasons Satoshi did what he did as he understood that collusion and vovernments and banks have the easiest time to manipulate centralized spot prices, easy as pie and unavoidable.
Problem is he didn't take those factors above + human stupidity into factor.

So bitcoin investor X bought and loaded up on bitcoi  from 2009 and throughout the first couple of years for an average price of lets say $400 and holds 1000. A very respectable sum and gain, even in 2018.

So in late 2017, assuming price of btc is 16k, Investor X, a nobody who spent $400 is now a somebody worth $15,600,000. At this point investor X can be manipulated ao easily into his own FOMO fears, as of now he holds this gigantic compounded investment and after buying the $1mm lambo, he has no idea how to protect the remaining $14,600,000.

Deus Ex Mechina, enter the most lawful casino houses, CBOE and CME.

For investor X to protect his remaining sum of   bitcoin, he has to buy either 1000 contracts in the CBOE or 200 on the CME. Also, he has to buy them at the lowest strike he can get from the exchange since he wants to buy his ""insurance"" as close as he can to his average price: $400, NO PARTY will trade on such a low strike so he settles for the lowest he can get, which os the MOST EXPENSIVE contract. Lets assume he sold a $13000 january contract, which is $1000 under our example spot price.
This means that as a hedger he has to put 43% of 13k on margin for the exchange as collatoral (ill get back to margin) now this is the schtick:

Since investor X has no real money, he has to dilute 43% of 5 bitcoin he owns into fiat and present that as margin. So here we go, he sells 2.15 bitcoin into the market everytime he needs to recover his margin.

Now futures act as a sort of insurance, yet there are rules, if the price flucuates above $25, you get a margin call. You either buy back the shorted contract for the full amount (5 bitcoins) or you continue with your position, dilute another 0.43 btc

How an absence of technological progress in a country may help Bitcoin?,"After years of isolation an Ethiopian romance with Bitcoin is still in the future. In May 2018 Ethiopian Ministry of Science and Technology's chief announced a partnership with one of the world's major crypto-currencies issuer. However, as far as the Ministry is concerned the block-chain technology must be all about monitoring coffee transit in and out of the country. Officially, crypto-currencies are absent in Ethiopia.

Unlike many of its African counterparts the National Bank of Ethiopia completely disregards existence of this new form of money. Same does the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority, which is responsible for collecting domestic taxes and custom duties. Because Ethiopia is the largest country in the world without a stock exchange there's, of course, no SEC equivalent existing in Ethiopia.

The only exchange officially recognized in the country is the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX), which was launched by the group of enthusiasts in 2008 and which trades only on five basic agricultural produces - coffee, sesame, beans, wheat and maize. So far local crypto-enthusiasts (if there are any) have been left completely to their own devices, which is, given the excessive level of control presently exercised by Ethiopian government over all other economical and social sectors, may be not such an undesirable outcome after all.

And yes, he's a seasoned miner and has the resources needed to do this project if we continue foward. We're working on the experience and skill part.

"Purse.io is shady as can be, and full of criminal activity. A criminal enterprise operating under the veil of faux legitimacy.","One thing you notice as you look through the wishlists you can buy from for ""earning"" bitcoin, is that they are full of shady names that obviously are made up, like ""Ching Chong"" or ""Beyonce Knowles"" and addresses you can not send to making you cancel the transaction. This indicates that they are heavily utilizing mail forwarders.  One of the big scams I've come to learn from using this service  is when someone receives an order from their wishlist, they will use the order number to get a second shipment with amazon customer support by claiming it never arrived or it arrived broken. I talked to an amazon account specialist after I was shadow banned on amazon and they told me someone requested a refund on my order for that purchase and that my account was flagged for suspicious activity. It has been hell getting my account back up. Also, when you request support, they will go days without replying, but when the admin asks something of you it will be 18 hours before he closes your case instead of the 24 they state. I am owed over 80 dollars from them after they closed the order after the buyer.  This website obtains property for free through fraud through the FEDERAL mail by promising crypto payment and then claiming otherwise about the order. The buyer gets the product twice over and purse takes a cut, racketeering if I ever heard of it. Not to mention if you post your wishlist on that site god knows what kind of crooks are buying your stuff with stolen credit cards. I have informed the FBI, Interpol, the Postal Inspection Service, and I am working on filing a complaint on BBB. The shady activity going on on that website needs to be investigated and I hope some poor soul sees this through google before they get screwed.

"Do not trust poloniex exchange, Stole my money and are ignoring me now","Poloniex Exchange recently decided after 2+ years of doing business with them to require more information for my account, That is fine they have every right to ask for whatever they need ect. But don't ignore me and steal my funds.

My account has been trading with them, small amounts, with a balance of 880$ USD for quite a while and never had a single issue and now all of a sudden my account is frozen out of the blue and I lost a bunch of trades that were set to auto buy back when the price dipped and they made sure to freeze my account at this point during a coin free fall before the buy back in what I can only imagine was there attempt to try to do the most damage to my trading account in hopes this would encourage me to jump on board and give them everything they wanted, but that will not be happening.

 I received no messages or emails from Poloniex support prior to this happening. I have all there email domains white listed in my email, and I had not logged into the actual website for a while since all my trades were mostly on auto pilot setup using API keys through my trading software ect. 

 This type of customer relations is not only unheard of for any exchange I have used in the last 8 Years, but literally the same customer service I got from Mt.Gox right before they went under, so I felt the need to share.  If they want to demand information and freeze my account this is fine but do not try to steal my funds when I ask to have my account closed. After these recent events and tactics witnessed I no longer trust them and will not be continuing with there exchange as a trading option, and I'm not sure how they think anyone would after being treated like this.

After deciding they were not professional enough to continue using and since I'm verified on Bitstamp, Bitfinex and a couple others already, who have never treated me this way, I informed them I would be closing my account instead and transferring my funds out asap. They acted like everything was fine and then locked me out of my already frozen account and have not responded to my support requests for over a month now. Yet they respond instantly to any other support requests and are clearly ignoring me now that I do not want to continue using there exchange. 

This type of customer service and support for an account that is over 2 years old with them is appalling. I'm just glad I recently transferred the bulk of my account balances out prior to this happening.

I would highly recommend if you use [Poloniex.com](https://Poloniex.com) to be very weary of them as they do not care how long you have been with them when the time comes you decide to move on they will likely try to rob you also.

I have already taken other legal steps at this point in time, and am posting this for the purpose of making sure other have a fare warning of my experience. I will attach my support ticket conversation that has been a single reply from support and now 30+ Days of being ignored, without even an update to say there still working on it or if my case was passed to appropriate department as they claimed.

OKEx Launched the Digital Asset Exchange Open Partnership Program,"artnership Program

On 20 Jun, 2018 (Hong Kong time), OKEx officially launches the Digital Asset Exchange Open Partnership Program and begins the recruitment of “OK Partners”. By sharing the fruits of OKEx's matching system, counter system, cold wallet, hot wallet, clearing system, multilingual customer support, as well as global know-your-customer and anti-laundering system cultivated for years with our OK Partners, the program is set to nurture a new generation of digital asset exchanges characterized by high autonomy, efficiency and transparency. Aspiring teams who aim to establish their own digital asset exchanges, only need to provide their domain names, logos, operation force, and to focus on the management and operations of the exchange. OKEx's global technical team, on the other hand, will provide R&amp;D and system maintenance supports to the teams, who will share the high liquidity and advanced trading experience offered by the world-leading digital asset exchange.

The 1st phase of the program offers 100 places for participating teams. Applicants are required to deposit 500,000 OKB in their accounts, excluding the amount locked for Designated Merchant, New Listing Vote, and Prime Investors. The ideal candidates for OK Partners should possess solid industry experience, quest for service excellence, and strong industry influence. The 1st phase is expected to go online in late July. Interested parties should submit their contact person's name and phone number as well as team description to [okbd@okex.com](mailto:okbd@okex.com) for application.",1529898849,25/06/2018 03:54:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tniku/okex_launched_the_digital_asset_exchange_open/,1

[Discussion] Will Bitcoin price double after its block reward halving?,"When block reward halved from 25 to 12.5 BTC its price dramatically surge. It was around middle of 2017.

The halving comes every 4 years, therefore it seems that next halving would be 2021.

To meet minimum maintenance fee for running such huge mining factory, I guess bitcoin price also should be doubled as its reward halves at next halving.

With this simple mathematics, I think Bitcoin price should go 2\~3k in upcoming years.

Stay curious,"I got in during late December after reading up on bitcoin since early November. I was definitely the kind of dude who would hang around /economics and openly bash bitcoin to my friends, without having a clue what bitcoin actually was.

Why do so many of us do that? It seems like a theme many of us go through. It's like I was defending my position, which was that I had missed out. It's some kind of cognitive dissonance that's hard to overcome if you're not curious enough, thankfully I became curious enough as i saw the price climb day after day.

I've been interested in stocks and economics for years and taught myself through podcasts and audiobooks from the likes of Warren Buffett and people with similar mindsets. And when something challenges your view of the world, you fight back. I think a lot of people fight back, and if you're not curious enough to want to keep learning about the world, you'll keep fighting.

I'm in to bitcoin for the same reason everyone else is. Monetary sovereignty, sound money, revolutionary technology and of course to be rewarded for seeing something that people who are not curious enough can't see.

Stay strong friends. And most importantly, stay curious!",1529903759,25/06/2018 05:15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tnykh/stay_curious/,1

Tell me your real world uses of Crypto!,"I believe Crypto has its place. There have been several times I wish it was mainstream.

Today, I sold a car. Buyer brought cash, but not enough. Sadly, he sent me an email money transfer. It took almost an hour to get to me! I asked him if he had Crypto, and he almost had no idea what I was talking about.

A few months ago I went to Mexico, and purchased a guided fishing tour. They would only take cash at the dock. Fraud is rampant in Mexico. If they accepted Crypto, not only could I have paid them instantly, I could have gave them a better tip. Apparently the guy who sold me the ""package"" forgot to inform me I had to buy bait too. Well, that came from the 'tip' fund.

These are just a couple examples. Crypto has a place in this world, and it will be adopted. How do you use, or places you could really see a good use of Crypto?",1529905770,25/06/2018 05:49:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8to4qf/tell_me_your_real_world_uses_of_crypto/,1

Down 70% and still HODLING: Here's Why,"I know a lot of people are panicking in this market and want to get out, but I'm not one of them, since i'd only be losing money over the long term if: 
1. I sell. Right now despite the huge crash in my portfolio since my fomo buy, I only have unrealized losses, which  would only materialize if I convert into fiat. 
  The same would be true if i was up 1000%. The gain would only mean anything if i actually cashed it out.
2. The market stays bearish for a long time. It's not that big a deal if we crash to zero and back again in a time frame similar to 2014. Even in the most bullish environment I'm not expecting to become rich overnight. The crypto millionaires are rich because they either believed in the underlying tech or simply forgot about their investment for extended periods of time (5+ years). There's many idiots who got in at sub 1$ and have nothing to show for it. 
 That being said, if the crypto market takes 20-30 years to recover, I'd be pretty pissed, since that would become dead money that could have been put to better use elsewhere (getting a down payment so I can try my hand on the real estate casino, getting in on the Nasdaq, etc). 
3. The market goes to 0. Pretty self-explanatory. Satoshi turns out to be Rothchild in disguise of something and Bitcoin crashes to nothing and I lose all my money. Definitely possible, but highly unlikely. At the very least, even if bitcoin has no other use case, it's still a good hedge against traditional assets. 
In addition, I expect big corporations to start printing their own money (AMZN coin anyone?). There's no good reason they shouldn't. They can raise money from across the world with no accountability. Once that happens the whole market will boom again. 
My advice to to everyone on this sub and to myself: stop looking at the charts and come back in 2 years. ",1529919340,25/06/2018 09:35:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tp6gr/down_70_and_still_hodling_heres_why/,1

Believe in BTC,"The mass psychology behind bitcoin is interesting, as it is with any new emerging techology which can be disruptive to the status quo. To me bitcoin is an idea with great potential, it is of course in a coarse sense a crypographic vault which is part of a network which is in itself self sustaining/self verifying and nothing escapes the eye of the network in a malicious way. Of course this is the idea of a safe blockchain. 

Seems simple but put this idea into our current world going through huge technological advancements and with an upheaval in the geopolitical image, with extremities showing in the form of of the Trumpet and the rest of the political world not finding common footing and keeping this machine of excess for the few, and less for the many. The pyramid defies gravity, money is funneled upwards, there is no trickle down effect. Borders have never been clearer and we forget who we are in the hate to others. 

There has got to be something that tips the scales and I don't know what it takes, but bitcoin to me, is not just a drop in the pond, not if it gains traction and the core idea about it is developed and integrated. It is definitely not a far fetched idea because it is timely, it is a pervasive idea in a corrupt world and we might sink or float on this but as long as it gives a good fight against the monopolised world and at the same time induces the idea that there is much to be improved then even that fight, which I think it is going through is a battle to harden the will of those who believe in btc or simply many of the use cases of blockchain.",1529931606,25/06/2018 13:00:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tqbb8/believe_in_btc/,1

Understanding the fallacy that the cost of mining gives Bitcoin a floor price (which it's falling under?),"I'm no Andreas Antonopoulos. But here's my understanding as to why  price can continue falling, yet how miners may still be compelled to mine because it will still be profitable for them to do so.

We were told Bitcoin's price can't fall under the price of mining a Bitcoin, that it has a floor. But then why is it falling through the floor?

My understanding is that the software adjusts the difficulty of mining the next coin to control the pace/progress of mining coins. The more powerful the machines are used to mine, the greater the level of difficulty set by the Bitcoin software to mine the next coin. 

In economics, a business will not pursue an activity if the profit is less than the cost of production. But it seems lately that the (lack of) demand for Bitcoin is lowering the price. So then, competition to mine the next coins is drawing back which will lead to the software adjusting the difficulty level to be more easy. 

Whichever miners are willing to wait it out for competing miners to drop out 1st will receive the spoils of successfully mining coins at a profit because the cost to do so will be less due to the lack of competition.",1529933398,25/06/2018 13:29:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tqiqn/understanding_the_fallacy_that_the_cost_of_mining/,1

Bitcoin Theft From Calling Scam Ledger Wallet Customer Support Telephone Number On Google Search Engine,"      I'm posting this to warn others about dangers on the Internet.  I had about two-thirds of all my investments in Bitcoin.  I was unaware of all the scammers on the Internet until one stole the Bitcoins from my Coinbase account.  Ledger Wallet imposed a mandatory upgrade to their hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.  When I was following the online instructions, I was locked out of MyEtherWallet with 'Error Code 5' and didn't find the instructions on how to get around this until April 1st.  They were on the MyEtherWallet website and I could go on my account after following those instructions to find my ERC20 tokens. 
         Be aware that Ledger Wallet in Paris, France has no telephone support anywhere in the world.  All the listings for toll-free numbers listed on Google and other search engines are to scammers.  The following warning was posted on the Ledger Wallet Twitter Timeline March 1st, but I didn't notice it until after the theft of my Bitcoins on 3-8-18.  There is no such warning on the Ledger Wallet website which would have prevented me from falling for this scam. 

[Ledger‏Verified account @LedgerHQ](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ)📷 [Mar 1](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/969171921916121088)  WARNING: Ledger does NOT provide customer support over the phone. Beware the scammers impersonating the Ledger support team by using 1-888-XXXX (or others) phone numbers. Don’t give control of your computer to strangers and NEVER reveal your 24 words to anyone!    

Never search for customer support numbers on search engines.  These are unverified listings.  If a company lists no telephone support number on its real website, it means they have no telephone support and they are not required to with cryptocurrencies.  Numerous customer support scams have telephone numbers which show up on search engines.  You should never call these numbers as you will be in contact with criminals.  You can type the number itself into the search bar and will often find numerous listings as the same number is being used to impersonate customer service for more than one company.  The scammer I called wanted to remote access my computer and I allowed him to do this as I thought he worked for Ledger Wallet without knowing Google doesn't verify the telephone numbers on their search engines.  It showed up on the screen that several bugs were found on the computer which needed to be removed.  The scammer said my Bitcoins needed to be moved off my Ledger Bitcoin Wallet for my own security while he was removing the bugs he pretended to have found.  He suggested I move them onto Coinbase which I did.  When he was done with his pretend computer servicing, he said I should stay off the computer for the next twelve hours.  The next morning I went onto the Coinbase account and found the Bitcoins were gone.  They had been sent to anonymous Bitcoin addresses and could not be recovered.    

I reported this sad story to the Palm Beach Research Group.  Their online educational materials introduced me to cryptocurrency investing, but they haven't included enough warnings for novice investors.  I received this message in response, but have omitted names as I don't have permission to post them.    

I'm part of     's team and I help manage his editorial content and social media presence. We're very sorry to hear about your situation.      read your notes and passed them along directly to        . The team also passed along your notes to Palm Beach Research Group's Customer Service division. Even though what you went through is awful, we're grateful to you for sharing your experience with us; right now, we're doing exactly as you advised: looking into providing additional warnings, advice, and how-to guides for spotting and avoiding the more insidious and subtle scams that are out there. That content should be coming out soon, I am told. Again, what happened to you was horrible, but with any luck we'll be able to help prevent something like that from happening to other subscribers. Thank you.    

It's gratifying to know others will benefit  from my mistakes, but I haven't found anyone who wants to restore the Bitcoins I lost.  I will provide my new Trezor Wallet Bitcoin address which has a zero balance at the time of this posting.  I would deeply appreciate any donations to help restore the 5.45130674 Bitcoins I had on my Ledger Wallet prior to the theft.  Please only donate if you are wealthy and have Bitcoins to spare as I will consider any Bitcoin I receive a gift.  It would help me survive this dreadful ordeal to recover the funds I lost and know I prevented others from losing much larger sums.  Feel free to pass this post on to anyone you know who owns Bitcoin.  Any donation will help.

                                                             3Hq4YJu9wfr8mLbx9ePQc79nKfN7mMUoex    

I have verified this address is the same one which appears on the screen of my Trezor hardware wallet and my computer screen.  It's important to make sure these addresses are the same when you receive funds.  The address above can only receive Bitcoin.  You can test this address by sending a tiny amount of Bitcoin and posting a comment for corsicanainvestor on reddit.  I will reply as soon as I see the comment to verify the amount received and validate this Bitcoin address.  Please only send a large amount after I respond to your comment to be safe.   I will post my new Bitcoin balance as a comment under this post so readers will know when my funds have been restored.

Here's part of a message I received from customer service at MyEtherWallet.  It contains important warnings about how to avoid dangers on the Internet.    

I'm sorry for all you've been through. It seems that those funds may just be lost forever, but I can't help but hold onto hope that maybe you'll get some sort of reimbursement for all the trouble and heartache you've had. I really do wish you the best in all of this. Whenever you are curious about anything, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to try and point you in the right directions, for future reference. This crypto world is lacking in decent support, so we at MEW try to help anyone who needs questions answered, even if it is beyond our actual range of job coverage. Whatever information I have on security, I'm happy to help.    

The phishers and scammers are on the loose! Protect yourself by installing [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige). Never enter your private information on ANY website without verifying it is the correct website. If you give them your private key, they can &amp; will steal ALL YOUR COINS.  - MyEtherWallet    

I have added  the above mentioned Google Chrome extensions to my Google Chrome browser to protect myself from phishing websites.  They look very similar to the websites created by legitimate companies, but are run by criminals who want to trick you into providing private information so they can steal your funds.  EAL stands for EtherAddressLookup and can be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store.  MetaMask and Cryptonite by MetaCert can also be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store and I have all three.    

Here's a list of more warnings I've come up with while learning about cryptocurrency theft.  It's important to warn others about Internet dangers to prevent scams.  These warnings came at a high price to me, but I want others to benefit from my mistakes.  I hope and pray my Bitcoins will be restored through donations from grateful readers.

1. Only call a number for customer service listed on a company's real website.  Never trust listings from search engines and be certain you are on the real website and not a phishing site.  The Google Chrome extensions you need to avoid phishing sites are mentioned in the conversation I had with a customer service representative at MyEtherWallet.
2. Never allow anyone you don't trust to have your private keys to MyEtherWallet or anywhere else your funds are kept as they can and will steal all your funds.
3. Never allow a stranger to remote access your computer even if a listing on the Internet appears legitimate.  This is something scammers want to do so they can come back later to steal your funds.
4. Be aware there are multiple ways the professional thieves have devised to steal your funds.  Never trust an email is from who it appears to be from.  If there is personal account information requested, never provide it.  It's very dangerous to click on links in suspicious emails.  You could be downloading malware or visiting a phishing site.
5. Never trust a caller on the telephone is who they claim to be.  Anyone who claims to work for a legitimate company and asks for sensitive personal information likely wants to steal from you and will tell you a pack of lies to put you in an urgent state of mind.
6. Never reveal your 24 word phrase to a cryptocurrency wallet to anyone.  Keep a record of it offline where you know it's safe and never take a photograph of it or put it into an email.  Those 24 words could be used to clone your wallet and steal your funds.
7. Trezor Wallet is recommended over Ledger Wallet as many Ledger Wallet customers have had unresolved issues due to a mandatory upgrade.  This presumed upgrade caused me to lose all my Bitcoins which could have been prevented if the March 1st Twitter Warning had been posted on the Ledger Wallet website.  Even after reporting this theft to the Ledger Wallet online support people, there is still no warning on the Ledger Wallet website regarding their telephone impersonators.  This was a negligent omission as this could have been copied and pasted from the Twitter Timeline March 1st and spared me this nightmare.  A warning about a security threat should not be reserved for the Ledger Wallet Twitter followers.
8. Avoid using cryptocurrencies to make purchases online as the transactions are irreversible and you cannot dispute the charges as you can with a credit card.
9. Always be wary on the Internet and never take posts at face value.  They may not have been made by the people they are pretending to be.  The Internet is a dangerous place filled with scam artists.
10. If a company has no telephone support number to call listed on their real website, it means they don't have telephone support.  Do not look up these numbers on search engines as this is how you will come in contact with criminals who want to steal your funds.
11. Never use a hardware wallet which has already been initialized and never order one advertised as being used.  People have lost their life savings by purchasing Ledger Wallets on ebay which have scratch off cards to reveal their 24 word phrase.  This was not packaged that way by the manufacturer.  It was tampered with and repackaged by someone who wants to steal your funds.
12. Beware of scams around every corner of the Internet and never assume postings are legitimate.  They could be made by criminals impersonating real customer support people you cannot call on the telephone or expect them to make any response to your online support requests on their own website.  It's a sad world of thieves and scammers on the Internet and it's easy to fall into their traps.  The lack of decent customer service in the cryptocurrency sphere has created a dangerous place for anyone who hasn't been warned about the extent that Internet thieves will trick and deceive their victims into thinking they want to help solve problems the company they pretend to represent cannot solve for you as they have no real telephone customer service and their online customer service is so poor that many see their requests for assistance never responded to.

FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS POST ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND YOUTUBE.  YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE THE TEXT OR USE A LINK TO CORSICANAINVESTOR ON REDDIT WITH YOUR OWN DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I'VE POSTED.  MANY OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS I USED TO WATCH BEFORE THE INCIDENT I NO LONGER WATCH AS IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN SINCE MINE WERE STOLEN.  I'VE OFTEN WISHED I COULD GET BACK THAT DAY AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AS I ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN WITH MY OWN POOR JUDGMENT, BUT THIS PERSONAL TRAGEDY CAN TURN INTO SOMETHING GOOD WITH YOUR HELP. 

SHARING THIS POST ANYWHERE YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE INTEREST IN IT WOULD HELP GET THESE WARNINGS OUT TO A LARGE AUDIENCE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS ENOUGH WEALTH IN THE CRYPTOSPHERE THAT SOME WEALTHY BITCOIN HOLDERS WOULD BE GLAD TO COVER MY LOSSES IN EXCHANGE FOR MY GOOD ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT YOUR CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND OTHER FUNDS.  PLEASE DON'T FORGET BIG NAMES SUCH AS VITALIK BUTERIN AND ROGER VER WHO BOTH HAVE A VERY LARGE FOLLOWING ON TWITTER.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS THEM ON TWITTER CAN BRING THIS TO THEIR ATTENTION TO SHARE WITH THEIR OTHER FOLLOWERS. THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WITH LARGER FOLLOWINGS WHOSE NAMES I'M LESS FAMILIAR WITH, BUT I WILL LEAVE IT TO MY REDDIT READERS TO SEE THAT THESE IMPORTANT WARNINGS ARE SHARED WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.  IF EVERYONE KNEW BETTER THAN TO FALL FOR THESE SCAMS, THEY WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO GO ON FOR YEARS.

I HAVE DOCUMENTED THIS CRIME WITH COINBASE EMAILS I SAW AFTER ALL THE BITCOINS HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM MY COINBASE ACCOUNT.  I  WILL COPY AND PASTE THE EVIDENCE INTO A COMMENT UNDER THIS POST.  ONCE I ALLOWED THE SCAMMER TO REMOTE ACCESS THE COMPUTER AND CONVINCE ME TO STAY OFFLINE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS, HE WAS ABLE TO GO ON THE COINBASE ACCOUNT AND IMPERSONATE ME.  THE AMOUNTS SENT TO THE SCAMMER'S BITCOIN ADDRESSES ADD UP TO THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF BITCOINS I HAD ON MY LEDGER WALLET PRIOR TO THE THEFT, BUT DUE TO FEES THE NUMBERS DIFFER AFTER 5.45 BITCOINS.",1529939456,25/06/2018 15:10:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tr9rz/bitcoin_theft_from_calling_scam_ledger_wallet/,1

Top 7 Best Cryptocurrency Wallets in 2018 — A Complete Guide,"### What is Cryptocurrency Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet (or crypto wallet), is like a bank account where you can store, receive, and transfer your cryptocurrency to another account — you can even purchase something with your cryptocurrency through the wallet! A crypto wallet allows you to conveniently and securely manage your cryptocurrencies, for both storage and trading purposes.

In general, there are 5 types of cryptocurrency wallets.

### 1. Hardware Wallet

Hardware wallet is known as the best crypto wallet in terms of security. The hardware wallet is essentially the same as traditional wallets, but in a form of a digital device to operate your account. Despite the security it can provide, its expensive price often hinders people from purchasing hardware wallets.

### 2. Online Wallet

Online wallet is the most common type of wallet as it is cheap, easy to use, and accessible from virtually any device — so long as you are connected to the internet. You can also manage multiple currencies at a time and use VPN for further privacy. Online wallet is attractive to the majority because of its speed, ease of access, and cheap price.

### 3. Mobile Wallet

Mobile wallet works similarly as online wallet does, except that it only works on mobile devices. You can get cryptocurrencies wallet apps from Google Play store or Apps store. The main catches for mobile wallet are their speed and ease of access, plus its QR code scanning features. However, be sure that you use well-known mobile crypto wallet — there are some reports on Reddit about fraudulent apps that could steal your bitcoin.

### 4. Desktop Wallet

Desktop Wallet minimizes your risk of getting hacked as you don’t need an internet connection to operate a desktop wallet. With a desktop wallet, nothing will be stored online — your cryptocurrency holdings and your private keys are securely kept in your device. However, your information is not free of human error (e.g. accidental deletion) and computer viruses. Desktop Wallet is usually free.

### 5. Paper Wallet

Paper Wallet might sound so old-fashioned, but it is also one of the most secure ways to store your cryptocurrencies. You will get the printed version of your public and private key, and you’ll need to complete the key for every transaction you make. There is almost no risk of getting hacked since it does not use any digital device to store your cryptocurrencies and no private keys are stored on third-party servers.

### Top 7 Best Cryptocurrency Wallets

There are numerous crypto wallets out there, but we'd love to share with you the 7 best wallets, according to our own research. Since cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any law of any country in the world, you need to be very careful in choosing your crypto wallet. It's a necessary investment that you take time to ensure that the crypto wallet you are going to use is not just convenient, but more importantly, secure.

Can't buy btc with credit card anymore,"Hey guys, i'm a noob with crypto so please forgive me if this is stupid.

Basically I have been buying btc quite often, using CC (stupid I know) most of the time, usually in smallish amounts 0-100€. I have done maybe 15 transactions those past 3 months, and never had an issue.
Then today I tried to make a purchase, but my exchange told me my bank didn't authorize the sale. Tried another exchange and had the same thing.

Does that mean my bank somehow individually 'blacklisted' me from buying crypto ? I haven't received a call from them or anything.

Bitcoin is like your friend who always flakes on social occasions but when you need a life saving operation he will be there for you.,"Everyone is always fixated on price. It is of course a very fascinating subject in bitcoinland. The price is not overly relevant to it's most important fundamental value propositions however, those being personal financial sovereignty and censorship resistance.

Bitcoin is rarely at the price you want it to be, but it always follows through in the end. So sit back, relax, enjoy Bitcoin for the opportunites it brings to society knowing that the price will eventually follow, as it has always done.",1529945142,25/06/2018 16:45:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ts1ac/bitcoin_is_like_your_friend_who_always_flakes_on/,1

Far-fetched lightning attack question,"Probably not a problem for most lightning users because they will not have large channel balances, but here we go:

Steps:

* Be a big miner who dislikes bitcoin and LN (bitmain) 
* Open a lightning hub and connect to all the other big hubs with little to no fees, get a large set of others routing through your node
* Wait until the mem pool is congested
* Close the channel with an old channel state that makes you money.  Since you are a miner, put a huge fee on it (maybe even more than half of the potential gain). Not only does it make it likely the invalid channel state will be accepted by miners, there is a % of hash power owned chance the fee will go back to yourself anyway.  Also, use accelerator services to hide the fact there are other rewards for miners to accept the old channel state as well.

Am I wrong in thinking that watch towers would not help here?  I can't of anyway to identify bad nodes like this, once they act badly they can be cut off of the network.  For us to really defend against this, don't nodes have to become watch towers and reject old channel updates?  If we modify node software to filter old channel states that will open up some other attack vectors maybe, and we can't make all nodes do it so it would be flawed in the same way 0-conf's are.

I Like Blockchain But I'm Not A Fan Of Bitcoin (or how this doesn't make any sense),"Relatively speaking I've been watching Crypto for over 2 years, but only just started investing back in February.

I see this statement being made constantly and it's beginning to sound absurd: ""I like blockchain technology, but I don't like Bitcoin"". I feel like the absurdity of this statement can be repeated to a non-bitcoiner or someone who doesn't understand the technology as the equivalent of saying I like basketball courts but I don't like the basketball. 

This half-assed shade throwing towards BTC &amp; other Crypto shows how afraid of being wrong people are. If you do not like Bitcoin then I truly believe you cannot like blockchain technology, it also shows ignorance to what blockchain actually is.

r/bitcoin survey: How miserable are you ?,"The [Bitcoin Misery Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-misery-index.asp) (BMI) incorporates the percentage of winning trades to total trades, as well as volatility. It shows a value of 0 to 100. Since we do not have access to exchanges insider information, we cannot measure BMI directly. However we can survey bitcoin hodlers about they own personnal misery.

Hence I hereby madeup the Personnal Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI_p) : If you sold your bitcoin now, what would be your gain or loss percentage? It can be expressed as

BMI_p == **bprice** * (**bhodl** / **$buy**) - 1

where **$buy** is the fiat you spent to buy the bitcoin you currently hodl, **bhodl** is the amount of bitcoin you currently hodl, and **bprice** is the current bitcoin price in the same fiat currency.

For example, if you bought 0.5 bitcoin at 1K, and 0.3 bitcoin at 14K, you'd have bought **bhodl** == 0.5+0.3 == 0.8 bitcoin for **$buy** == (1000 * 0.5) + (14,000 * 0.3) == 500 + 4200 == 4700$. Considering bitcoin is now worth 6200$, your BMI_p == 6200 * (0.8 / 4700) - 1 == 5.53%. In other words if you sold your bitcoin now you'd had gain 5.53% of your investment.

Since BMI_p is a percentage it can be revealed without revealing your **$buy** nor your **bhodl**.

Please upvote my comment that corresponds to your BMI_p: &lt;-60%, ]-60%, -50%], ]-50%, -40%], ]-40%, -30%], ]-30%, -20%], ]-20%, -10%], ]-10%, 0[, ]0, 10%[, [10%, 20%[, [20%, 30%[, [30%, 40%[, [40%, 50%[, [50%, 60%[, &gt;60%

I'll also make sure to update after my experience there.",1529989390,26/06/2018 05:03:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8txbpg/athena_bitcoin_atm/,1

Why bitcoin will never die,"The biggest hurdle in Bitcoin's history isn't going to be when it recovers from this recent drop or when it first broke $1000 or even when it first reached parity with the American dollar, but when it went from nothing to something. I like to think of this moment as when Laszlo bought his pizzas. Ever since, bitcoin has grown in value and all of it's growth has been organic and from the grass roots.

Why did Jercos accept 10000 magic internet coins from Laszlo?  Was it because he thought he could later trade them in for more value? or hold until moon for lambos? The ironic thing is that he could probably buy dozens of lambos today if he wanted to. At the time however, they were completely worthless with literally no real life users. People like Jercos supported bitcoin in it's infancy because it represented a completely new idea of money and one that is far superior. The problems that we are dealing with in bitcoin today are largely due to it's infancy; bitcoin and crypto is still too young and adoption is still growing. You can't expect bitcoin to take over the global financial market in under 10 years starting at 0 users. 

People like Jercos and Laszlo supported bitcoin when it had no monetary value because it represented an idea of decentralization, financial freedom and separation of money and state. The early supporters and innovators of bitcoin HODLed because they understood what bitcoin represents, what it could be and that any technical inadequacies can be later improved upon. This is reason why we have segwit, lightning network, hardware wallets and numerous new inventions and add ons.

The biggest driver behind bitcoin's success is not the protocol itself but rather what it represents. Bitcoin is an idea, the real adoption is a psychological one. The real support levels of bitcoin are the innovators who are busy creating their idea of what bitcoin could be and the true believers who support bitcoin not for financial gain but rather because they are boycotting their current system. They are not going anywhere and neither is bitcoin. ",1529989782,26/06/2018 05:09:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8txczm/why_bitcoin_will_never_die/,1

Bittrex account hacked with 2FA enabled- BE CAREFUL,"I want to share my story about Bittrex negligence in securing my funds.

On June the 19th a hacker was able to intrude in my Google account.
1. He stole passwords from ""Google Auto Sign-in"", a tool I use to automatically sign-in to websites using stored credentials
2. downloaded photos of me and of my passport from Google drive
3. arranged these pictures with Photoshop or some other photo editing program to make a photomontage showing me holding my passport
4. entered in my Bittrex support account and submitted a ticket to disable 2FA security on my account
5. put a rule in my gmail to filter all messages from Bittrex and send them directly into the trash bin. 
6. At the request of identity verification he just posted 2 photomontages one showing me holding a paper sheet reading ""bittrex 19.06.2018 Please disable 2FA"" and another one showing me holding my passport. 

In only 25 hours and 12 minutes the Bittrex agent gave him green light to disable 2FA, while I couldn't see any email from support, cause I don't check trash bin of my gmail so often.
He immediately entered in my Bittrex account where I had crypto currency for about 40000 USD value. 
He withdrew all my funds to his crypto currency addresses.
Despite the very suspicious activity the Bittrex support agent didn't lock withdrawals up nor even put them on hold as it's usual after 2FA disabling. 
The suspicious signs were:
1.   IP address of a location on the other side of the globe respect to my usual login site
2.   Request to disable 2FA security without a motivation
3.   two low quality photomontages which anyone can easily realize coming from one single original. Indeed only centering, contrast and background color were changed to mimic two different photos. 

Below I report the whole emails exchange between the hacker and the Bittrex support agent

Printing much Tethers does not matter.,"The usual measure for BTC is fiat. Revisit the equivalent ""tether"" activities in the fiat markets, that no one blinks at:

\- Quantative easing handing banks literally free money in the trillions

\- Quantative easing throwing trillions into American stocks (mother bubble)

\- Government bond creation (debt) = money creation out of thin air, inflating your fiat

\- pumping real estate with debt, money that banks churn out of thin air

\- pumping (shitty) altcoins to insane levels with altcoin owner Bitcoins (why it's correlated)

and the list goes on and on..

...even if Tethers weren't backed by fiat it's still viable if we are to have some pairity with the hyperinflation happening in fiat.

Question is .. are we to have special rules that BTC can't be touched by fiat inflation (but only savings?)",1529999355,26/06/2018 07:49:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ty736/printing_much_tethers_does_not_matter/,1

Bitcoin funds audit when buying a house,"Hello everyone,

Perhaps not the right place to post this, but I'm not sure. Help would be really appreciated.

I'm trying to buy a house with Bitcoin-related funds, however they are referring me to a bitcoin 'audit company' known as elliptic, who think that the cost will be around 15,000 GBP (around 20,000 USD) simply to do an audit. That's an additional \~8&amp;#37; fee on the house

This seems extremely steep. Is this really what is absolutely required to buy a house with bitcoin-based funds? It seems like they just want to do the same KYC stuff that exchanges to, but at a 15,000 GBP price tag?! 

I understand KYC is absolutely required when doing something like purchasing property. But the audit cost seems a little crazy.

Something seems wrong here. If I'm wrong, I suppose I have no choice but to throw that money away...but I'd like to avoid it if possible...",1530014915,26/06/2018 12:08:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tzh7w/bitcoin_funds_audit_when_buying_a_house/,1

mature state of LN funding?,"question, i'm curious what the expectations are of a future state of BTC+LN if BTC is considered security/settlement and LN as payment channel for majority of transactions, with on-chain tx fee being what i assume all people would objectively consider ""high"" - comments on these/additional thoughts?

1. is opening a channel expected to be a rare event - maybe i open channels and settle them annually or something?  maybe never even settle them?
2. to diversify/expand routing, i'm far better off opening 8-10 channels rather than 1-2, correct?  i assume at some point a large number of open channels also becomes algorithmically problematic in determining best route?
3. i have a pretty small/vague understanding of the liquidity as some abacus model, essentially i need to fund a channel a nontrivial amount to get some real use out of though however - 100 minimum if not 1000 to make my life simpler, is this a correct understanding?
4. given high on chain fees, does this approach not simply eliminate the potential use case of extending btc to financially excluded participants?  ie. no land line telco infrastructure in parts of africa was built - it was simply skipped with the evolution of mobile phones.  as low fees (LN) requires an on-chain BTC wallet and acquisition of some BTC to participate at all, mobile USD banking for someone living on $2 is fully eliminated, is it not?
5. or perhaps this person can participate by acquiring something with cheap on-chain fees and opening a LN with that; but i'm confused how this works.  ie. i send someone $20 in doge, they open an LN wallet with it, aaand...  at this point i'm confused as to how some crypto/crypto conversion might actually work and settle properly (although maybe this is not a real potential case/use??)

LN/InVoice/Re-use/LN wallet,"Today I was testing the Android Lightning wallet. Specific for receiving BTC via LN payments.

First step was place some coins in my wallet. (3 config)

Second, I openend a channel, to ACINQ, and funded the channel. (3 config)

First test was than a LN Payment. I used Bitrefill for top-up my phone. In a few seconds, payment accepted and phone Top-up. I used my channel to ACINQ, no channel to bitrefill.

Second test, receiving using LN. I decided for a withdraw from https://www.moneni.com/. Again using the standard channel. 

You only fill in the amount, and description, the wallet created the invoice, and just copy and paste. The payment request is than valid for 2 days.

After a hr, I decided for a new test, and made a new invoice, same amount, and again, valid for 2 days, and worked fine.

My question is:

**Is there a problem for the wallet, or the LN network, if I use the same invoice, multiple times?**

After I received the payment, the wallet shows me that there was a LN payment, and gives the description from the payment.

What will happen if I use the same invoice, 2 - 10 - 20 - … times in the next 2 days?

Will that give a problem for the wallet, and/or can that give a problem for the LN network?

Lightning network doubts,"Main lightning network is about to be launched soon so I decided to educate myself a bit about what it actually is. Graph of all the existing channels, gets bigger every day so it looks promising. My concern here however is that it is highly unpractical to have all the money allocated in multiple channels because people need to use the money and not everyone has excess money to leave it laying around in multiple channels. So the unevitable outcome is that people will be creating fewest channels possible with fewest hops to other people to sustain their money liquidity. Emergence of some 'hot' spots is already to be seen in current lightning network graph. Arent this new 'hot' spots or channel 'hubs' exact same centralisation we are trying to fight in the first place? We all are already using lightning network in fiat ... by having channel opened with the bank which then sends money further for some fee. How is bitcoin lightning network differnent from this?

I thought maybe people will be actually incentivised to have money allocated in channels as they would get paid some fee when others would use them as vertex point. This could reduce the centralisation, but the topology of the lightning network is unclear and could very well end as the system we are currently having with fiat.

What are your thoughts about this?",1530037551,26/06/2018 18:25:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8u2eiz/lightning_network_doubts/,1

Help me understand how more transactions are possible with Segwit.,"I was reading this and it makes no sense to me.  https://medium.com/@jimmysong/understanding-segwit-block-size-fd901b87c9d4  

It seems that 1MB is still the limit for legacy nodes and hence, no matter how you look at it, only 1MB of transactions per block are possible.  So with Segwit, we didn't get a block size increase at all.  In fact, because of the additional witness data in each transaction, using Segwit transactions, we actually get less transactions per block.

You People Are Mostly Delusional,"And i've been around my share of delusional people (r/WSB). Whenever i hear ""stay positive"" or ""hodl"" and other mantras it reminds me very much of an MLM speaker. Preaching about get rich schemes, staying motivated, networking and all this other dribble ambitious people buy into. Yes bitcoin does have promise and im not going to discredit it does have it's place in the future. But that isn't anytime soon and the amount of hype and money you people allocate towards it right now is honestly a waste built on the prebust hype, volume, and manipulation before it was tradeable as a derivative. Im not saying go full personal finance and invest in shitty vanguard ETF's i certainly don't and its mostly worked out for me. But you're far more likely to see better returns quicker investing in regular securities, and for the riskier of you i've definitely multiplied initial investments in a couple days with some questionable options plays, fin.

What really happens when government bureaucracy goes easy on Bitcoin?,"Despite previously issued memos, signed by career Ghanaian bureaucrats, which evoked possibility of crypto-currencies going completely legit in Ghana, in its January 2018 memorandum Bank of Ghana representatives announced that trading and using digital money in Ghana falls outside of the Payments System Act.

It says ""The Bank of Ghana wishes to notify the general public that these activities in digital currency are currently not licensed under the Payments System Act 2003 (Act 662) . . . The public is therefore strongly encouraged to do business with only institutions licensed by the Bank of Ghana to ensure that such transactions fall under our regulatory purview"".

Although this statement just reinforces the notion that digital currencies are currently unregulated in Ghana, overzealous local officials may also interpret it as a hint on the illicit nature of all crypto-related assets. For a country, which has consistently spent its resources to establish itself as the African technological leader, this resolution can do more harm than good. Among other negative consequences it might result in unnecessary legal restrictions and drive Bitcoin underground.

I have a theory regarding to the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos,"What if the price of all these cryptos, especially Bitcoin, are all altered only in December? I was thinking that if December is the time of the year where the economy mostly moves, then this can also affect the cryptos. I believe that if that's the case, then it its worth buying Bitcoin, BCash and Ethereum from now so that when it comes December, then trade them or do something.

Anti Anti Time Cash Club Member:Bitcoin's Price 2024,"Whats up woollies!!!  


*About Me*

I'm 22 half brazilain half korean, been hacking since sophomore year of high school. We found the codes to travel back in time on accident by hacking a data center in Suriname. `PRO TIP ITS NOT A DATACENTER` 

This message is being digitally sent from the year 2095.  Ironically I work at Outback Steakhouse part time in Virginia but I live in the bali.   


*How Time Traveling Works*

It's a little long to explain but it works kinda this; The Spirit Of Humanity or life is like an electrical current, laid out on a complex electrical grid, and it's possible to build a micro controller for you to interact with the ""grid"". 

Current science and math is a little short of the stick, because we can only measure and study whats 1) Here on Earth 2) With what we have. 

I'm little short on time funny enough, because time is in fact ""monitored"" We aren't the first ones to figure out how to get out of the maze..Think of it as the quality assurance department. 

*The World*  
Korea because unified, reading long passages of text becomes utterly annoying. China(Eurasia) is like America after WWII thanks to the One Belt Initiative. America ain't no joke, but it's no China. Thanks to climate change new jobs opened up; like you can get paid 13/hr to hunt for parts and equipment in New York. Or, if you want to brave Phoenix you could get paid double. It's about 225 right now. 

People including those within college don't *need* to read books. Seriously, theirs so much information that it's pointless to read. Most people learn by ""gisting"" which is getting the bare information needed to do the job. 

Renting is pretty chill, I don't need a house because we all travel all the time. Seriously, the time it takes to go from one side of the planet to the next is like a bus ticket. Though why take the bus when you can just fly their yourself? (Ford came out with the Mustang Platinum 7K. It's self driving, flightless, and I can answer emails during the drive. Has an onboard computer which you can easily download tinder ;-) (which speaking of dating omg its annoying)

Smartphones are nearly obsolete. It's like blockbuster? In my timeline, as everyone has a digital assistant. A DA does all that a smartphone does and more. It combines having a personal assistant and smartphone into a neat package. You can also mate with it to have kids if that's your thing. 

Racism has shifted towards discrimination based on status. Ya some people are still bias against color of the skin, but its more about whats in your wallet. It's a huge problem to be honest..You could lose your job just because you don't have a Versace street bike.

*Corporate Warfare*

&gt;The rise of corporate influence in governments rise until the Second Great Recession hits and everyone gets really really really upset. People don't trust anyone anymore and civil war nearly breaks out, but is stopped thanks to the proposal of a decentralized government

Having a single bitcoin in my life is like discovering an oil field. Now its being touted as digital gold..kek try digital oil!  
I don't want to spoil the fun and tell you prices ;) but I will say hodl.  Bitcoin is the dinosaur...so imagine how much money having a real dinosaur would be in today's times.   


*The Woolies*

In the future some of you guys will be regarded as the ""woolies"" A meme for the smart nerds who's invested into bitcoin; the woolly mammoths are the people who's mega rich. They bought and held bitcoin for **years** &amp; that's pretty much unheard of.    
I think its around 5&amp;#37; from 2019 held. A lot of its value increased just due to a decrease in supply. The earthquake that struck California and parts of Canada did a 313&amp;#37; increase. That's not even including what happened in Maimi!

Anyways the woolies are new class of rich, they got so much money they don't know what to do with it. Some invest, some buy more stuff, others live a simple life. Really its due to bitcoin that we see the first trillionaire. Anyways..hodl on even during dismal times..  


ps:

Nowadays people are fighting and arguing over gun rights...you here the saying ""whats a gun gonna to do to a drone?"" well in our time its ""whats a drone gonna do to the hackers?"" ;)

How the Bitcoin OTC Market Works - Kain Warrick and Marcus Ochmann,"[VIdeo is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPq0rqrm4xM&amp;t=258s)

Hey guys, in this video we're discussing the Bitcoin and ICO OTC (Over the Counter) markets. 

For traders in the $250K+ category, trading OTC is most likely the preferred option. OTC might be institutions, private traders, brokers, etc. This not only allows a layer of security for their buys, but allows them to bypass the regulations put in place by traditional exchanges.

Just Added Coinbase Commerce to my Website!,"I know Coinbase gets a lot of hate sometimes on Reddit, but the new ""Coinbase Commerce"" application has been a godsend for our website.  We previously used some custom made application that would forward transactions to a middle address, then it would collect a fee and send the remainder to our address.  Aside from being incredibly inefficient (3 transactions instead of 1 for each order), it was also pointlessly expensive.  About 0.0002 per transaction, which adds up fast on small orders.

About a month ago Coinbase Commerce introduced a plug and play checkout that allows us to collect our orders in BTC  with little friction whatsoever.  The amounts are stored on basically a separate Coinbase wallet that we can withdraw from at any time.  The interface is familiar since it's basically just Coinbase, and the fees are incredibly reasonable (1&amp;#37; I believe).  This means we don't get screwed on smaller transactions.  We sell digital gaming items like OSRS Gold, CSGO Keys, etc. so many of our customers are only spending $5 USD or so at a time.

Link: [https://commerce.coinbase.com/](https://commerce.coinbase.com/)

Before we were using Bitpay, and I made a post here about them clearing double spend transactions on our site, which ended with us losing some money.  They replied that we should have waited for X confirmations, but that was difficult for our agents to track in the backend of our website.  Interestingly, only a few days later Bitpay shut down our merchant account and told us our business model was ""too high risk"".  Our website is [R2Pleasent.com](https://r2pleasent.com/).  We had been operating on Bitpay for about 2 years prior to that shut down.  Really convenient timing!

Buying bitcoin with a broker.,"I think I understand brokers and how they make money. 
Please Correct me if I am wrong. 
Example:
I want to buy $10,000 USD worth of btc. the gross is -5%(discount) and the net is -1%(commission)
If I understand this right it is I get $10,000 worth of btc for $9,500 and the broker gets 1% which equals $95.

Questions about transfers. Fees and speed.,"I've been using kucoin and transfers are cheap but slow, I kinda understand how it works.

But...

If I want to make BTC transactions in less than 20 minutes would it be faster to use an electrum wallet and choose next block for transfer or use a wallet on blockchain.info and  put in a manual fee of like 100 sato/bytes.


So the lower the fees the slower the transfer, but does that mean the hire the fees the faster the transfer?

So even if blockchain.info is only recommending i do 10 and put in 100 sato/bytes ill be faster in transferring then 10?



If I wanted to transfer 100$ in btc to an exchange, what would be the fastest way to transfer? what wallet/fee would I want to use for max transfer speed?",1530080859,27/06/2018 06:27:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8u7bzi/questions_about_transfers_fees_and_speed/,1

A Secure Offline Bitcoin Payment System,"A paper titled Secure Wallet-Assisted Offline Bitcoin Payments with Double-Spender Revocation (https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/inst-infsec/system-security-group-dam/research/publications/pub2017/asia084.pdf) was published a while ago. The paper proposes the first solution for secure Bitcoin offline payments using an offline wallet with several novel security mechanisms to prevent double-spending and to verify the coin validity in offline setting.

There are three phases:

1. Online Bitcoin preloading.

2. Offline Bitcoin payment.

3. Online redemption of coins and revocation of double spending attacks.

&gt; In the first phase, the payer X generates pre-loading transaction τl (step 1) that transfers some bitcoins from her standard Bitcoin account x to the offline wallet’s account w, so that the balance of w becomes positive. This is done by means of standard online Bitcoin transaction, for which the network generates n-transaction confirmation n -Tl. 

&gt; In the second phase the payer X requests W to generate an offline transaction τo with the desired amount destined to the account y (step 3). 

&gt; In the third phase, the payee Y redeems the bitcoins he received offline by broadcasting τo into the Bitcoin network (step 4) and optionally obtaining network confirmation n -To (step 5). 

&gt; The network confirmation will only be issued, if the network has not detected a double-spending attack against τo. Otherwise, the payee Y will trigger an optional double-spender revocation procedure, which includes sending a double-spender revocation transaction τr (step 6) to the Bitcoin network and obtaining corresponding confirmation n -Tr (step 7).

How does the transfer between the payer and payee's wallet actually happen if both nodes are offline? Does the offline wallet operate as a Layer 2 protocol somewhat allowing for deferred settlement like LN?",1530082384,27/06/2018 06:53:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8u7gk5/a_secure_offline_bitcoin_payment_system/,1

Something wrong with BitFlyer Japan?,"Until now withdrawal of money or coins was possible without delay.

Since a few days I can neither withdraw money nor coins. So my account is blocked.

Not only my account. There a a lot of Japanese customers of Bitflyer who cannot get their money. 
The complaints hotline is totally overwhelmed, it takes hours waiting for your turn. And then the person on the phone would not give any answers. He will talk to the person in charge, but will not tell if or till when you can expect an answer. 

Now Bitflyer is a place you can send money and coins to, but cannot get them out anmore. 

Last week we got some information from Bitflyer Japan that they got an ""improvement order"" from the the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA).

It looks that they now review the information related to KYC.

The result is that withdrawal of money or coins is blocked until further notice. But they don't say when that will be.

My information, like Japanese address, bank account, contact email and phone number etc. has been approved and was ok till now. Nothing changed, but suddenly me and many others are blocked. What's going on.

"Bitcoin Isn't Deflationary, Or I Cant Figure It Out?","Bitcoin seems to be constantly touted as deflationary, and my feeble brain can't  seem to get it. 

1 BTC = 1 BTC  I think we can all agree to that.  The inflation in Bitcoin occurs daily, as new blocks are discovered, and rewards reaped.  

The awesome thing about Bitcoin is we know exactly what percentage the supply of BTC will increase, until rewards for miners are solely fee based.  This controlled inflation is unlike any other unit of account that I am aware of, that is also decentralized.

I am unclear how Bitcoin is in any way deflationary when it's supply is increased daily, and again, 1 BTC = 1 BTC?",1530091922,27/06/2018 09:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8u884f/bitcoin_isnt_deflationary_or_i_cant_figure_it_out/,1

It's ok to just cut your losses and move on,"The average bitcoin transaction has a carbon footprint of 501 kilogram of CO2 and consumed around 800,000 times more electricity than a VISA credit card transaction. Bitcoin currently consumes 0.32% of the world's electricity supply. Those costs will find their way back to the users, one way or another, most likely either through high inflation or through high transaction fees.

The network functions due to a massive proof of work system that leads to enormous industrial facilities in China and other places with cheap electricity. However, this reward drops by 50% every four years. 

As the electricity wasted declines, it becomes easier to double-spend on the network. Some forks are good examples of the risk the system faces when the electricity spent on a proof of work network is very low. In the words of Mark Karpeles: ""For proof-of-work to be an effective method of blockchain protection, it needs to be an ecological disaster.""

People on this subreddit won't tell you about this, because they're ""hodlers"", who plan to sell their coins to the next fool, for an even higher price. A lot of you reading here are probably people who bought in at the top of the bubble and now patiently waiting to break even on your investment. There's no guarantee that will ever happen.

My suggestion is simple: It's ok to just cut your losses and move on. You have no obligation whatsoever to watch as the money you invested into this scheme completely evaporates, which it will if you stick around long enough.",1530098246,27/06/2018 11:17:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8u8rot/its_ok_to_just_cut_your_losses_and_move_on/,1

People should stop advertising shops accepting Bitcoin.,"The logic is pretty straightforward.

When you buy stuff with Bitcoin the merchant isn't really getting Bitcoins, he's getting dollars. An intermediate such as BitPay sells your Bitcoins and pays the merchant.

Thus, spending your bitcoins isn't different than selling, it drives the price down.

The only accepted way of using Bitcoins is to trade directly for them without going through fiat first. Find merchants, people on craiglist that accept Bitcoin.

The Great Bitcoin Story (a philosophical/mythological origin story of Bitcoin),"A little time ago, somewhere on the Earth (probably) a human decided to make a new game for other humans to play, where there are points you can collect.  This human, who likes to hide from the public, and be called by the mystery name ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", called the game Bitcoin, because it was made to be played especially on computers, which use ""bits"" that are like ones and zeros to store information. And because the main point of the game is to collect ""coins"".

Bitcoin is like the game with the money that you might know from countries and other large areas — like Euros, dollars, yen, pounds, and so on — only in this case, instead of a government or a big bank (that the government approves of) deciding what the rules of the game are, this individual human was the one to do it.  This human decided to keep the game mostly on computers, where those who played kept track of the scores for everyone, using computer software to do lots and lots of math, including adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.  The computer files that keep track of the scores are called a ""ledger"", named after the old paper notebooks that humans used to keep track of scores before they had computers.  Eventually, a lot of other humans decided to play the game, and now the game is somewhat popular all around the planet.  Anyone who has a computer and can figure out what the rules are, can play, though some kinds of play are very complicated and require very fancy computers.  Some humans even get together to make whole buildings full of fancy computers to get as many points as they can.

The original way to get points was to help everyone playing keep track of the points that everyone playing has, using computers.  But now you can also get points by finding someone who already has some points and giving them other kinds of things, including points from other games like (the local currency), or stuff or favors, in trade, or even sometimes they will give you to them for free, like a gift.  And sometimes other players will steal your points, which is mean, but is definitely a part of the game where humans really want points (usually used to trade for things they need, or really want).

One of the important parts of the game is having a secret code of numbers, letters, or words, which they call the ""key"".  If someone else gets your key, they can take your points.  So players are very careful to hide those keys in different ways.  It's much harder to steal points from someone if you don't have their keys, though it is possible.

There is really no goal in the game other than to collect points.  So it's not that interesting a game compared to more creative games, but you can sometimes use your points to trade for fun and useful stuff, and because humans change the value of the points, compared to other points and things, you can sometimes get a lot of cool stuff for very few points.  So that's where many folks find the fun in the game.  Players who get really into the game can also have fun working on the rules and finding interesting ways to change them a little bit, or a lot.  But they can't just change the rules the way they want, as most everyone else has to agree to play by any new rules.  So they don't change too often.  Also, some players like to make things that work with the rules, so that you can play the game on different kinds of computers/devices, and in slightly different ways.

Finally, the folks who like this game a whole lot sometimes like to compete against other games, and say that their game is better, especially since anyone who wants to play, or help make the rules, is allowed to do so, as long as they can figure out how, and can get a good enough computer.  Most other money games don't let just anyone make the rules or keep track of the score, and many Bitcoin fans think that's no fair.  They think their point collecting game is more fair, and thus those who play the Bitcoin game are winners no matter how many points they have in the game.",1530103765,27/06/2018 12:49:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8u9c1o/the_great_bitcoin_story_a/,1

There’s nothing “Happy” about HAPPY TAX,"On March 26th 2017 I hired HAPPY TAX to handle my crypto reconciliation and e-file my state and federal taxes.  500$ with a 100$ discount that didn’t work originally, but was rectified quickly. 

No mention of a back log or filing extensions before I purchased. After I purchased I was actually reassured that there’s still plenty of time before the 17th to get it done on time. 

First contact was Lynne for the reconciliation. Starts pushing me to file extension “we offer it for free” 

I paid to have my taxes done on time.

She was against using Btc.tax.com info. Even though I already paid them 30$ to do it and it’s advertised on there site they accept it. She claimed api info isn’t accurate. She wanted to manually enter each csv file into their way of doing it. I did business on only Coinbase and gdax. I had no other income or dependents. This was the easiest scenario possible and she made me jump though unnecessarily hoops that procured identical data that I already had. 

No personal attention to the customer. I kept getting emails about extensions. I kept asking for definitive answers about my taxes being filed on time. No dice. Just generalized or mass email answers. 

No professionalism. When I finally was called by my “CPA” the numbers didn’t jive at all. They persisted in my using their minimization method. I have a business degree, two years of corporate, business and personal IRS tax along with 2 years of accounting that I excelled in and graduated suma cum laude GPA 4.0

I say this not to brag or boast- who gives a shit? I know that FIFO IS THE RECOMMENDED METHOD. 

I asked can I change to FIFO next year: SURE. NO!
You have to file a written reason a year in advance for such a change. 
If I had taken their “advice” I’d of been audited. The minimization method accounts for gains in later years -not good if you plan on making a lot of money in upcoming years. Completely ridiculous unprofessional advice. 

The answers I’m giving here are directly from a reputable local CPA by the name of Hunter Nottingham. He accepts business from anywhere in the US. He’s also working on several crypto apps for tax and filing purposes that are more accurate and user friendly for next year than what’s currently in the market. He’s an avid crypto investor, accepts crypto as payment for his personalized services and is very adept at crypto reconciliation done the right way.

HAPPY TAX strung me along from March 26th to April 15th and two days before the deadline tried to charge me an additional $250 because of multiple exchanges. COINBASE owns GDAX. They are one of the same. Coinbase is a buying/selling platform and GDAX is an actual exchange owned by the former. I was outraged at this point. After sending an email mentioning my concerns and disappointment, the CEO admitted to having some hiring issues and problems. But then went on to up-charge me $250 for filing a complaint.  I lost it. I called and spoke to Christa my “CPA” livid. I asked for her CPA license number and she says she doesn’t have one because she’s not a CPA. But she claimed to be one earlier. FRAUD

They decided to refund my money two days before the tax deadline. AND BASICALLY LEAVE ME SCREWED ON TAX DAY. 

I got my money back a day after the tax deadline.

Hunter Nottingham did my brothers taxes. So I called him. 24 hours. Done. Accurate. Personalized attention. Professionalism. The Cost? $400. Effortless.

**Find an item** (i.e., a dress) that you may have seen in a magazine or on a website (such as Pinterest or Instagram). If you don’t know where to buy online, you can upload a photo and ask other Bitfortip members to search for it online to win a  bitcoin reward. UI is like Instagram so it's pretty easy to use. 

**Find a better prices** By offering a small Bitcoin reward for members to search for you, you increase your probability of finding that item at a lower cost.

**Find a piece of information** on the internet that you may not know about. Post an inquiry along with a Bitcoin reward for people to find you a certain link, image, etc.


**Once you create an account**	 a bitcoin address is generated where you can then deposit some funds to post an inquiry on the platform. Minimum amount required is 0.0001 BTC roughly 10 cents.

If anyone wants to try it, send me a pm with your **username and what would you like to find, so I can give you some test funds**

I'm convinced we need bitcoin,"I've been held small amounts of bitcoin since 2014 and I liked it for all the technology and the whole 'idea' of decentralisation. But today citibank closed my account for some random shit reason and the only warning they gave me was some email about a month ago which i missed since they send me roughly 1000 mails a month with 'important' credit card offers. It's extremely shitty that they can do this without even trying to contact me once on call or get a confirmation from me. 

We need decentralisation and we need to own our private keys! I feel incredibly helpless that they are able to do this to me. Having said that they've mentioned that I'll be able to get my money transferred to some other account. So thankfully the amount I held there is safe at the moment.

How does a hedge fund buying spot bitcoin (actual bitcoin asset) and selling short/long futures correspond to each other? 

This current bitcoin crash you can relate the price to when futures go online and when they settle.

Bitcoin Explained in Three Levels of Difficulty! Lesson 1: Bits (Rudimentary),"Hi all,

I started a YouTube Channel, and here is the short pitch:

&gt;Ever get frustrated when someone explains something either too simply such that you feel like you’re missing a lot of the main details or with too many complicated words such that it goes way over your head?   
&gt;  
&gt;RRR Academy bridges that gap for a wide range of concepts related to technology. Every lesson for every concept is explained in three levels of difficulty: Rudimentary, Realistic and Remarkable. 

[Here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Hzu5YM-5I)is a link to the first video, which is the Rudimentary Difficulty of the first lesson on Bits.

I love teaching and given the lack of understanding of Bitcoin outside of this community, I figured I could fill a need with this channel. 

Please let me know what you think. Each video takes a lot of time so I want to know whether or these type videos are effective and helpful before I decide on how to move forward.",1530133337,27/06/2018 21:02:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8udc4c/bitcoin_explained_in_three_levels_of_difficulty/,1
For how long will we pretend the problem doesn't exist,"I am here for a long time (look past reddit date) with the community. There is a very clear problem that arises very often and we all know that is the fees. They make Bitcoin as a payment system quite unusable. We had a divided community split in Nov and then the narrative of ""store of value"" started.  

Let's stop being pretentious here. How many merchants after stripe, microsoft, expedia and many others will stop accepting Bitcoin? This is the OPPOSITE of adoption.  

I was there sending emails in 2011 to merchants to get accepted because we had this great payment system that would revolutionize everything. WHERE IS IT?  

I had many discussions here with people that are involved deeply and I am hearing some irrational arguments that high fees now are \*good\* but they will be fixed. Like you need to fix something if it is good.  

Well, when it is actually fixed it will be TOO LATE.  

This should be a wakeup call. The problem can (and could) be temporarily solved by increasing the block size for now along with rolling LN. Or just find another solution.  No innovation EVER had reversal of adoption and then went on to become dominant!

P.S I don't care if I get banned at all. All I care is the thing I am fighting to convince everyone online and IRL is better than existing systems. ",1530133371,27/06/2018 21:02:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8udcab/for_how_long_will_we_pretend_the_problem_doesnt/,1

Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change to List and Trade Shares of SolidX Bitcoin Shares Issued by the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust,"[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf)

I've read it quickly, and I must say, that VanEck has a nice trick with OTC trading. If you remember, in 2017 most of the ETF were rejected because SEC said it's too hard to determine singular BTC price since there are so many different prices across exchanges. If they use OTC trading, the price is negotiated each time with OTC dealer, making previous argument from SEC irrelevant. Furthermore, they are going to provide their own custody for Bitcoins and insurance.

"Why I Hate Bitcoin Shortsellers, Bears, and Bitmex","Bitmex is an irresponsible exchange that allows 100x leverage to short-sellers.  They have created massive selling pressure through their exchange on the price of Bitcoin.  There are huge groups of shills all over the forum spreading misleading information just to knock the price down.  They specialize in creating FUD out of even the most obviously positive news.  

The only thing saving bulls is that in an absolute sense Bitcoin has a limited supply of coins.  So while bears might be able to market dump thousands of coins to manipulate the value of their leveraged positions, they will not be able to stop the price from going up when enough accumulation has taken place.

While it is true that people can go 100 times long on their positions, they do not have an army of people intentionally posting positive news across the entire internet.

The best way to beat bears is to keep quietly buying.  They are determined to kill the entire market.",1530135706,27/06/2018 21:41:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8udnbg/why_i_hate_bitcoin_shortsellers_bears_and_bitmex/,1

He went on to illustrate this with the Betamax/VHS wars how it was won because Betamax tapes were max 60mins and VHS 90mins. There’s some BS right there. Betamax tapes max out at 120mins. The war was lost because VHS was cheaper and Sony wouldn’t licence the machines for making pornos. So it wasn’t a better product that won. It was a product not restricted by licensing/patents and it was cheaper - just like lightning is cheaper than onchain payments.

Bitfi Hardware Wallet,"I posted a link to a website on the Bitcoin and Monero subreddit last week on a new type of cryptocurrency hardware storage. My post was criticized heavily by its readers, most providing little to no information to back their opinions. Rather than to argue blatantly I decided to construct my own due diligence to hopefully create an open conversation about crypto wallet security on this subreddit. Therefore I will provide an in-depth analysis of the Bitfi hardware wallet based on all information publicly available. As a disclaimer, I am not an affiliate with Bitfi, and all related references used in this post will be added below.

Despite all the negative headlines Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have received over past decade these digital assets have increased in tremendous popularity and price. Its usability revolutionized the way value is stored, transferred, and exchanged. The intrinsic benefit of this new technology led to an explosive innovative growth in both computing hardware, and many other blockchain-based assets that operate within a highly secure digital infrastructure. The functionality and authenticity of these blockchain assets come at no debate, however with the growing number of users an issue still remains of where to properly store coins/tokens from either being lost or stolen. In the article, 'The Most Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Wallet Guide', written by Simona Vaitkune on Medium gives a detailed breakdown on the five types of digital asset storage options including online, mobile, desktop, hardware, and paper wallets.

The general concept of digital wallets is to allow users to virtually store their cryptocurrencies, which are secured by a public and private key. These wallets heavily differentiate from each other based on levels of security protection which depends upon several key aspects including hot/cold wallets, anonymity, and multi-feature security layers including two-factor authentication (2FA), multi-sig, backup files (12- 24 word recovery seed), and software updates.

Hot wallets are meant for instant use and are only accessible if linked by an Internet connection to use on exchanges, desktop, or mobile applications. Digital assets stored on hot wallets exemplify the greatest potential risk for unrecoverable funds. The security of hot wallets is mainly dependent upon the security habits of the individual holder and third parties themselves. They are considered most vulnerable based on prior evidence from exchange server hacks, phishing scams, and computer vulnerability as well if broken, stolen, or infected with malware.

Cold wallets refer to a type of storage that is not connected to the Internet and can be secured using different facets such as a hardware device, paper, and even brain wallets. Its access resides offline until manually retrieving the private key using a pin, mnemonic phrase, or both. Long-term funds are likely to be held in cold wallet storage and by far the safest option in regards to security.

Bitfi is a global payments technology company based in the US that enables businesses and consumers to securely participate in a decentralized economy. Their mission is to accelerate the growth and adoption of digital assets. This past week the company released their Knox hardware wallet focusing mainly on user-friendliness and air-gapped security. When visiting the homepage of the Bitfi website they state its “the worlds first un-hackable device”, and seeing this as someone who has been in the computer space for over 15 years it can bring a sense of unease. Ignoring the fact that they supposedly have John Mcafe now on their team, let us dig in further to what makes this device so remarkable.

The transition of storing cryptocurrencies on any type of cold wallet can seem highly technical for someone who is inexperienced with encryption technology. If sets of rules are not followed funds can be lost forever. Bitfi intends on making this easier and safer for the average individual. Instead of having to write down a 24-word mnemonic phrase or separate private keys for each coin, and then worrying on how to safely store it from theft or damage. Bitfi created an algorithm, which acts similar to a brain wallet giving a user the freedom to make a long unique phrase they can easily remember (for example: “Ilovemyjobbecausetheypayme@5”) will be specific for them and impossible to guess or brute force.

Unlike popular cryptocurrency hardware devices such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S, the Bitfi Knox wallets DO NOT store the user's private keys in the hardware. If the Bitfi Knox device is stolen or seized and then taken apart the keys are unable to be retrieved. Since there are no private keys are stored on the device there is also no potential for a “man in the middle” or distribution attack that can occur where a user's keys are stolen prior to actually receiving the device. We saw this happen when unfortunate consumers purchased the Ledger Nano S from 3rd party sellers this past year.

As explained by CEO Daniel Khesin, the Bitfi Knox wallet is not a storage device but rather a separate CPU running calculations for their open sourced algorithm. A secret phrase the user created will calculate the private key to sign for transactions made on the Bitfi dashboard. The device will also update automatically to the latest firmware when connected to Wi-Fi, and routes to company node that allows a user to view all their balances on the device. Bitfi will also release an app on the phone that will work with the Knox wallet to allow their users to purchase products and services on the go.

The device itself has a smartphone type of look to it with an LED Touchscreen, multi-currency support, dashboard and other additional customizable features. Bitfi plans on continually integrating blockchain assets every few weeks. They currently support Bitcoin, Ethereum (ERC20 tokens), EOS, NEO/GAS, Litecoin, and lastly Monero being the first company to functionally implement the popular privacy coin on their wallet without additional downloads from Github.

On their webpage, it looks as if the wallet already went on sale, and within a short period of time sold out entirely. In my opinion, I have never heard of a hardware wallet that performs like this so I am interested in purchasing one just to see if Bitfi Knox succeeds in its functional promise.

"Bitcoin Price Risks Another Fall Below $6K, Charts Say","After a drop yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) risks another move below $6,000 in the next 24 hours, but it will still likely fare better than other cryptocurrencies, Omkar Godbole wrote in an article at Coindesk. 

In his view, BTC could drop below $6,000 (February low) and could test immediate support of $5,755 and $5,711. A daily close below $5,755 (Sunday's Doji candle low) would open the doors to $5,090 (rising wedge breakdown target). On the higher side, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $6,425 (April 1 low) would abort the bearish view and allow a corrective rally. BTC will likely outperform other cryptocurrencies as indicated by the bearish breakdown on ETH/BTC chart.

"For Monero to catch on, we need to be educating people that Bitcoin is NOT anonymous.","Hey r/Monero!

I just wanted to give my thoughts on something that we need to be stressing more heavily in our community.

A majority of everyday people who don't consider themselves very tech-savvy believe in the misconception that Bitcoin is inherently an anonymous digital currency. (Warren Buffet: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/19/heres-what-warren-buffett-really-thinks-about-bitc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/19/heres-what-warren-buffett-really-thinks-about-bitc.aspx))

Most tech people who consider themselves fairly familiar with technology (but not so much with cryptocurrencies) believe that Bitcoin is anonymous. (Bill Gates: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/02/27/bill-gates-i-dont-think-bitcoins-anonymity-is-a-good-thing/#46f038a71395](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/02/27/bill-gates-i-dont-think-bitcoins-anonymity-is-a-good-thing/#46f038a71395))

These two alone spread enough misinformation about this that it convinces a majority of the population that Bitcoin is anonymous. Even r/bitcioin has posts saying Bitcoin is anonymous with 50+ Upvotes ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ym3be/you\_can\_buy\_bitcoin\_almost\_everywhere\_anonymously/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ym3be/you_can_buy_bitcoin_almost_everywhere_anonymously/))

It's clear to me that there is too much misinformation out there about how blockchain works and what separates Moreno from the standard public blockchain. Looking back I'm not sure where I was going with this post, so I guess let this be a reminder to remind people that Bitcoin is not anonymous, and there is a valid use-case for something MUCH better which is built to be anonymous.

How is there technically a btc core development team,"Can't any upgrades to the protocol from anyone be proposed to the bitcoin community and be accepted? If people complain about the core development team can't those same people pick up development themselves? For example if people complain that the devs are taking too long to implement lightning, cant they just code a lightning implementation themselves and propose it to the network to get accepted? I don't see how developers have control over the coin and get to choose when bitcoin hard and soft forks then unless its just a thing for miners that if its being proposed you better fork or get left behind if everyone else goes with it. Maybe I'm not explaining my question right but if its decentralized I dont see how there technically is a core development team. I'm only thinking about this because I saw a letter from the coinbase C.E.O. criticizing the core development team for taking too long to implement something a few years back and I thought to myself if he is so frustrated with the core team's ""inaction"" why doesn't he just hire a development team itself to put forth the code and let the community decide if they want to soft fork to it.

FuzeW Hard Wallet - First Look,"A few days back I got a chance to check out BrilliantTS’s cryptocurrency hardware wallet called [FuzeW](www.fuzew.com) which is set to release next month. Having previously used Trezor, I was quite interested in this new offering. For those who don’t know, FuzeW and Trezor are hardware devices to store your cryptocurrency in a hack-proof environment. 

The product comes in a small black box with a shiny FuzeW engraving on top. On lifting the lid, I was greeted by the FuzeW enclosed in a soft black covering. 

[Original box](https://imgur.com/qkAhwO5) (after opening)

Underneath the card, I found a black envelope which carried the recovery sheets, followed by a white slide-in charging cradle. One of the employees informed me that the eCharger text on the cradle will replaced by Fuze. Sounds like a good decision to me.

[Charger underneath everything](https://imgur.com/hjrDjIZ)

So the first thing I noticed was how beautifully the card has been designed, and how similar it looked to my credit card, and how very different from other hardware wallets.

[Another view of the card](https://imgur.com/MBDL4qu)
 
It felt slight heavier than my credit card and quite sturdy in my hand. What I liked most about the design was the premium, rubbery feel, and how easily it can slide into my Ridge Wallet (which is a credit card holder type wallet) 

The 3.1 inch e-paper display has 3 buttons on the bottom right hand corner that allow you to select designated currency, split transactions between payment methods, and lock the card for security purposes. The card can be managed via an android/iOS application and additional cards can be added to the account just by taking a picture of them. In case your FuzeW is left behind, the mobile app will alert your smartphone and you could erase all the information on your card just with a click of a button. FuzeW has adopted multiple security layers such as SEIC and EAL-5 certified SE, two factor authentication, and OTP verification.

Another thing I’d like to point out is the IP68 rating against water and dust, which is the same as the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy. ",1530159392,28/06/2018 04:16:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ug9u5/fuzew_hard_wallet_first_look/,1

State of Bitcoin ATMs in Japan?,"Longtime lurker, first time poster.

I've been trying to find info on the state of Bitcoin ATMs in Japan, mainly Tokyo. The Pink Cow in Roppongo used to have one, as did Numazuko Sushi in Ginza. Both have been removed. Looking up ATMs online, I find a lot of dead links and old information, but so far the pattern shows that a lot of former Bitcoin ATM hosts have removed them.

I heard some stories that new regulations in 2017 meant that it was too difficult to operate an ATM legally, but I haven't found more than rumor or speculation on that front.

Does anybody know what happened to all of Tokyo/Japan's Bitcoin ATMs? And are there any working ones left in Japan at all?

The future of BTC based on historical financial bubbles,"From Wikipedia,

&gt;An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. 

BTC is a bubble because its value almost entirely speculative. Its real world advantages to fiat are minuscule while having significant downsides. There are details of every economic bubble resulting from over-speculation since 1950 below.

**The Poseidon bubble**

&gt;The Poseidon bubble was a stock market bubble in which the price of Australian mining shares soared in late 1969, then crashed in early 1970.   
&gt;  
&gt;In the late 1960s, nickel was in high demand due to the Vietnam War, but there was a shortage of supply due to industrial action against the major Canadian supplier Inco. These factors pushed the price of nickel to record levels, peaking at around £7,000/ton on the London market early in November 1969. In September 1969, the mining company Poseidon NL made a major nickel discovery at Windarra in the Shire of Laverton, Western Australia. In early September their shares had been trading at $0.80, but as information about the discovery was released, the price rose until it was trading at $12.30 on October 1. After this, very little further information came to light, but the price continued to climb due to speculation; at one point, a UK broker **suggested a value of up to $382 a share.**  By the time Poseidon actually started producing nickel, the price of nickel had fallen. Also, the nickel ore was of a lower grade than originally thought, so extraction costs were higher. Profits from the mine were not sufficient to keep Poseidon afloat, and in 1976 it delisted. [Western Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMC_Resources) then took over the mine, operating it until 1991.

**POS now trades at $0.037 AUD per share.** Over-speculation in something that turned out to be near worthless led to its share going to 0. BTC could share the same fate if it does not prove superior to fiat. Note that POS still has value as a mining company.

**The dot-com bubble**

&gt;The dot-com bubble was a historic economic bubble and period of excessive speculation that occurred roughly from 1997 to 2001, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet.   
&gt;  
&gt;Most dot-com companies incurred net operating losses as they spent heavily on advertising and promotions to harness network effects to build market share or mind share as fast as possible, using the mottos ""get big fast"" and ""get large or get lost"". These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough brand awareness to charge profitable rates for their services in the future. In January 2000, there were 16 dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV, each costing $2 million for a 30-second spot.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ""growth over profits"" mentality and the aura of ""new economy"" invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish spending on elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Upon the launch of a new product or website, a company would organize an expensive event called a dot com party.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com\_bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)

*Processing img a35qj9bk3p611...*

Summarising, people were sucked into buying shares from companies that were not actually profiting (growing in real value) believing they could get rich quick. Once prices got too high, people sold and the bubble popped. **It took 16 years for the index to return to the previous high**. The value of the index currently sits at 7445.08. Note that internet-based companies have much greater real-world value than BTC currently.

 **Japanese asset price bubble**

&gt;The Japanese asset price bubble was an economic bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991 in which real estate and stock market prices were greatly inflated. In early 1992, this price bubble collapsed. The bubble was characterized by rapid acceleration of asset prices and overheated economic activity, as well as an uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion. More specifically, over-confidence and speculation regarding asset and stock prices had been closely associated with excessive monetary easing policy at the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;By August 1990, the Nikkei stock index had plummeted to half its peak by the time of the fifth monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). By late 1991, asset prices began to fall. Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992, the economy's decline continued for more than a decade. This decline resulted in a huge accumulation of non-performing assets loans (NPL), causing difficulties for many financial institutions.

Opinion: BITCOIN CANNOT BUBBLE,"Hey guys just want to share a fun opinion piece with you. Do you believe bitcoin is in a bubble? Do you believe it will bubble in the near future? Let me explain some reasons why it might not turn into a bubble. 

First off, the tokenomics of Bitcoin works so that there is only a finite of bitcoin in existence. The mining system of Bitcoin is a way to attach physical real world value to the digital currency this of course helps to legitimize it to a point. Also, as Bitcoin gains traction from institutions and Wall Street, it could be legitimized as a digitized store of value. With this thinking, Bitcoin really comes off looking like digital gold. With its PoW system placing physical value on Bitcoin + its huge future popularity, can anyone truly say for sure that Bitcoin is a bubble waiting to happen? this is the first time we have encountered such a system, so no one can really be sure. I believe the reasons stated above could possibly make it bubble proof. 

*Yes of course there can and will be small bubbles, but will there really be a bubble that will make bitcoin valueless? 

What are your thoughts/opinions on the matter?

This bear market might be the last opportunity for factor level roi.,"I really can't blame people for not buying bitcoin pre 2017.  A lot of people are busy with their lives and few even heard of it back then.  But in 2021 (2.5 years) I will blame people who were made aware of it and chose to ignore it this time around. 

Maybe 25x returns will not be possible with each additional having. Eventually bitcoin returns would be equivalent to a bond yield maybe by 2028.  

From here maybe 12x by next post halving bear 'bottom' in 2022.  Still a remarkable return for those with enough skin in the game.  

Right now while risk is high we can expect appreciation but as that risk comes down the asset becomes best for storage of value and transfer of value.

Anyway, some food for thought.

To all the people who doubt technical analysis.,"The merits of technical analysis have been debated on this subReddit countless times. Some people are advocates, while others are skeptics. 

I have been a stock trader for many years, and I base all my purchase decisions solely on technical analysis. The same principles apply to trading crypto as they do stocks.

Yesterday I bought AVGR near the close at $1.78 per share and wanted all the skeptics to keep an eye on this for the next day or two (I am expecting to exit the trade before the close of Friday).

I don't want anybody to buy this stock....just to watch what happens to it, and if it explodes in value within the next 2 trading days, I want you to know that I picked this solely by using technical analysis, and that you might want to reconsider using technical analysis when choosing your entry an exit points for trading bitcoin.

What happens when the number of holders exceeds the number of coins?,At the current moment an estimated 13million to 28million users of btc exist. Based on a quick look at coins available for sale that haven't been list or stolen I would hypothesize that their are more people trying to acquire bitcoin than there are bitcoin available. Also considering the rapid adoption rate this has not been the case very long if ever. From economic theory is there anything that explains what happens when such conditions are met? And what happens when there are 20 million hodlers?,1530192098,28/06/2018 13:21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ujcnz/what_happens_when_the_number_of_holders_exceeds/,1
Fun with Spanish,"Just noticed a spooky coincidence today...

The word *lightning* in Spanish is *relámpago*.

If you split that into two words and translate back to English, it seems freakishly coincidental, considering what the lightning network is:

relám = relay

pago = payment

Help with Trezor Update 1.6.2 for Trezor One,"I have a Trezor One containing my BTC.  My current version is 1.6.1 and looking to upgrade to 1.6.2.  I have done the dry-run to check that I have my seed words.  I have read that this update will wipe my Trezor, and although I supposedly have my seed words, wiping my device is giving me anxiety just thinking about it.  So, a few questions below for the group before I do anything:

1.  Do I have to update?  I only used my Trezor One as cold storage for BTC and don't need the new bells and whistles.  Am I at risk of losing my BTC if I don't update my Trezor for an extended period of time?

2.  If I wait for version 1.6.3, is there a chance Trezor fixes this issue and uploading from 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 will not require wiping my device?

3.  If I send my BTC from Trezor to Coinbase as an extra precaution before the wipe, will this create a taxable event when I send my BTC stash back to Trezor?  Will the IRS now know how many BTC I have?

4.  I have my seed words and a passcode at the end.  Does this affect anything with the Trezor reboot besides turning on the advanced password mode and typing it in at restart?

5.  Is there any possibility greater than 0&amp;#37; that the correct seed words will not bring back my original wallet holding the bitcoins?

I am trying to take precautions with my BTC by not keep them on an exchange, etc., but this is kind of annoying and scary.  Thanks for the help.",1530199118,28/06/2018 15:18:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ukdbm/help_with_trezor_update_162_for_trezor_one/,1

The state is:," The State, in the words of Oppenheimer, is the “organization of the political means”; it is the systematization of the predatory process over a given territory. For crime, at best, is sporadic and uncertain; the parasitism is ephemeral, and the coercive, parasitic lifeline may be cut off at any time by the resistance of the victims. The State provides a legal, orderly, systematic channel for the predation of private property; it renders certain, secure, and relatively “peaceful” the lifeline of the parasitic caste in society. Since production must always precede predation, the free market is anterior to the State. The State has never been created by a “social contract”; it has always been born in conquest and exploitation. The classic paradigm was a conquering tribe pausing in its time-honored method of looting and murdering a conquered tribe, to realize that the timespan of plunder would be longer and more secure, and the situation more pleasant, if the conquered tribe were allowed to live and produce, with the conquerors settling among them as rulers exacting a steady annual tribute.",1530202519,28/06/2018 16:15:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ukvvp/the_state_is/,1

Inquiry about Tone Vays,"Hi Guys,

I have been watching a few of Tone Vays' recent videos and he comes across as pretty knowledgeable and confident with his technical analysis. 

He is making predictions such as BTC bottoming out this year (2018) in October/November between 3K-5K, which is pretty specific. 

Can someone in this subreddit please advise if this guy actually knows what he is talking about. I always get this fishy feeling when watching his content.

I personally just correlate Google Trends to BTC price to get the best understanding of what's going on.

Thanks! ",1530221826,28/06/2018 21:37:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8unmv5/inquiry_about_tone_vays/,1
No. Bitcoin won't kill banks.,"K,  just face it,  they'll be there for the entire human history. A bank will finance the next mass extinction. 
Because it's unstoppable, banks will adapt to crypto and they'll just integrate bitcoin in the business. 
You're gonna have bitcoin loans and bitcoin saving accounts. Bitcoin credit cards,  all that shit. All linked to probably an official state coin. Probably a small number of decentralized altcoins too. No shitcoins :). 
If a coin won't make it on the list they deal probably will lose a lot of exposure and value. 
They will attack. 
They will invest in farms and will manipulate the market in every way they will be able to. Just like today with... basically everything.

It seems like people think that the Lightning Network should take over all the transfers just because it scales the transfers/second very well.

"Bitcoin in Quebec elections: Conservative Party of Quebec leader supports Bitcoin miners and a free market, opposing Hydro-Quebec Bitcoin regulations and tariffs, calling-out politicization of Quebec's energy and Bitmain lobbying.","\*\*Context\*\*  


 The Conservative Party of Quebec is a small, new political party in Quebec currently polling at around 3-5&amp;#37;, with close to 10&amp;#37; in some regions. Back in 2013, a lot of Bitcoiners supported this party, which is \*the first and only\* Quebec political party to accept Bitcoin for membership, since 2014 if I remember (proof: [https://i.imgur.com/b0anaXl.png](https://i.imgur.com/b0anaXl.png)). Many of the Bylls team, as well as our customers and friends, are supportive of this political party as the best for Bitcoin. Even if the Conservative Party is too small in Quebec to affect the Bitcoin mining outcome, Bitcoiners can count on some politicians to have their backs.  


 \*\*Quote\*\*   


""Cryptocronyism at the Liberal Party of Québec? In January 2018, the president of Hydro-Québec announced publicly that he was hoping to be able to sell millions of dollars worth of electricity to the energy-hungry cryptomining industry, a fledling business that had begun sprouting in Quebec without government permission or hand-outs. Then suddenly, just two weeks later, HQ started toback-pedalling, arguing that it would not be able to respond completly to the long-term demand in the sector. It later said that it had received projects for 18,000 megawatts (MW), representing 40 &amp;#37; of its production. Such a request was far beyond what it could provide and, if it were accepted, we were told, it could compromise the electricity supply of Quebec consumers (we wouldn't want Mrs Tremblay to be run out of electricity while cooking her dinner turkey!). But any expert in cryptomining worth his salt could have told you that this figure was only a speculative demand boosted on steroids since the world's current consumption of cryptominers is about 4 400 MW! 

Hydro-Québec has actually confessed during public hearings held this week that it never investigated the seriousness of the projects submitted. Hydro-Québec had all the powers it needs to refuse most of these frivolous requests. But our politicians wouldn't want a good crisis to go to waste... they immediately saw an opportunity to seize... a few weeks before the general election. Philippe Couillard's government has used the usual fearmonging tactic (pretext: an atypical demand) to politicize once again the Quebec energy market by imposing a moratorium then a tortuous auction system to sell electricity to what it arbitrarily considered the ""best"" cryptominers... 

By happenchance, at the same time, Bitmain, a huge Chinese monopoly with a dubious reputation, started an intense lobbying effort in Quebec. Why would I not be surprised if, in the middle of the electoral campaign, Minister Pierre Moreau announced ""a major structuring investment"" by Bitmain, accompanied by staggering promises of job creation in various areas of Quebec (notably those where liberal candidates with sagging polls need a boost for their campaign), all in exchange for a long-term contract with our public utility? We've seen this movie before with wind power and biomass contracts! If this is the case, this shameful diversion of Hydro-Québec for electoral purposes will not only harm Quebec cryptomining companies but will also confirm the reputation that Quebec is not open to business unless you rely on crony capitalism The Conservative Party of Quebec would stop politicizing Quebec's energy and let the free market decide winners and losers of any new technology, to the benefit of Quebec consumers.""   


\*\*[Tweet](https://twitter.com/APouliotPCQ/status/969963324766121985)\*\*  


""Couillard: Quebec closed to cryptomining business.  What a shame. The [~~#~~**pcq**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pcq?src=hash) would welcome with open arms the private innovation and R&amp;D $ + income taxes and huge profits on electricity sale!""

My prediction - take it or leave it. (Trading View Analysis),"I dont post here a lot, but wanted to share with you some of my predictions that could happen using my Moving average charts on trading view.

I will take you back all the way to 2013 first. 

https://i.redd.it/rm6l4drp7u611.jpg

Here we hit the peak of the highest point so far BTC ever was on 11-28. Far above the 365 day moving average (and all others for that matter.

By April of 2014 BTC was more than half of its peaked value just 5 months earlier. 

https://i.redd.it/ue1ipr758u611.jpg

2014 was a very slow year. In fact, the whole year BTC never recovered to its peak and by the end of 2015 BTC had fallen 70&amp;#37; from its peak. for half of the year BTC was below the 33 day MA, 55 Day MA, and 365 day MA.

https://i.redd.it/ycy7iyhk8u611.jpg

Half of 2015 BTC kept moving down, but the MAs were catching up. By July BTC had reached the 365 day MA at $272.

https://i.redd.it/ufonq7yz8u611.png

By October 2015 BTC had divergence with all the moving averages at $276.

https://i.redd.it/b1vmlzc99u611.jpg

Then for the entire year of 2016 BTC was very prosperous. It had spiked back above the previous record.

*Processing img ovig54gk9u611...*

Again, 2017 was the best year BTC has ever had. It peaked to $19,000. 

2017 was almost identical to 2014.

*Processing img drqz2wpx9u611...*

Where are we now? BTC has taken an almost IDENTICAL trend to 2014. We are just not getting below the 365 day moving average. 

*Processing img vgdk0c96au611...*

So based on this pattern -- My prediction, which means nothing, is that BTC will have down periods for the next year and a half. This is a great accumulation period. Buy BTC at any time during this down trend - By the end of 2020 BTC could easily be $190,000.",1530234257,29/06/2018 01:04:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8up21s/my_prediction_take_it_or_leave_it_trading_view/,1

"BTC price manipulation is inescapable, but that may not be a bad thing","Monopolies become an economic choke-point. A gasoline monopoly increasing prices in order to make voters angry with an incumbent government, is a good example. Because of the risk monopolies present, nearly all participants in any given marketplace prefer orderliness and systemic bias against monopolies. Even nasty, mean-spirited, selfish rich people dislike monopolies (no, really) because their chances of becoming a beneficiary of one are exceptionally slim (statistically speaking). We don't mind the playing field being uneven - tilted in our favor - but we (as a species) are deeply biased toward fairness. This isn't ideological, it's [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

***Could any government in the world buy or sell enough BTC to change the market price?***

This is relevant to the question of BTC price manipulation, because it means two things are pretty certain: (1) governments and wealth managers are always actively looking for ways to manipulate BTC markets and (2) we will tend to end up manipulating BTC markets cooperatively.

***How do you stop the 'Weapon-ization' of Bitcoin?***

Governments (via state banks, coordinated by NGOs like the IMF, World Bank, BIS) will secure sufficient reserves of BTC to allow them to counter any possible manipulation by any other government that holds BTC. To avoid deploying it, they will agree to targets for easing/tightening based on inflation and growth. They will allow for transparency in the decision making process and will lead to limited stabilization of the BTC price. 

If you think this sounds a lot like the broad strokes of the [Gold Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) you're right.

Government buying and selling can indeed smooth out daily BTC price fluctuations. A coordinated group of BTC reserve holders that are able to buy or sell 10&amp;#37; of the total BTC supply can offset huge 'black swan'-scale economic shocks. 

What this sort of buying and selling cannot do, however, is drive inflation. Inflation is the tool that governments use to keep people from hording currency. Spending is the 'Product' in GDP. Savings aren't counted, except as a contrarian indicator of economic health.

***So what would this look like to a BTC user?***

The value of BTC will go up over time, and you won't want to spend any. You will spend BTC on the bills you have to pay and the things you believe will appreciate in value even more quickly than BTC. The price of BTC will fluctuate by less than 1&amp;#37; on a day-to-day basis, and on average will close each day with a slightly higher value than it started with. The rate of appreciation will tend to match the incremental accumulation of global wealth plus the inflow of wealth coming from sale of other similar assets (like gold, treasuries, bonds). In the first few years of BTC's emergence (until \~2022) the rate of appreciation will seem rough with occasional surges of FOMO buying and profit-taking. On the whole, appreciation will be sharp. As volatility drops, the average incremental growth rate of BTC exchange value will fall toward the rate of global economic growth. Using gold as a guide, we can expect this to happen as the total capitalization of BTC approaches $5-10 Trillion USD (give or take a few $Trillion).

Major fiat currencies (EUR, USD, RMB) are not likely to disappear. Governments can require that their contractors, suppliers and employees accept their preferred fiat currency and can require that fees and taxes are paid with that same currency, creating arbitrary demand and supporting infrastructure. For day-to-day purchases, it may be commonplace to use fiat currencies for the foreseeable future, given the extensive existing infrastructure and well-understood regulation. For the average user, BTC may take the place of savings accounts, savings bonds, gold, annuities, treasuries, real estate, corporate bonds or even equities. For the next several years, people will use their BTC for major transactions like paying off student loans, buying cars or houses, paying off large tax bills, taking vacations, paying for medical expenses and the like. As the rate of increase in BTC value drops, it will become more and more commonplace for people to use it for increasingly smaller and more mundane purchases.

***Are governments already manipulating the price of BTC?***

Even without any specific evidence, it is quite safe to assume that they are. Any given government knows other governments can do it, therefore, they must also. Again, this is just application of [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). It's not driven by any particular ideology or political viewpoint. Assuming governments are not all grossly incompetent (they aren't), we could also expect that they are exploring how the price of BTC can be manipulated and how they can monitor the markets for such manipulation. They are experimenting.

At this stage, where the market value of the entire BTC supply is still quite tiny, it may well be that some governments are actively doing so-called 'destructive' testing. If, at this stage of development they were to 'break' BTC the economic repercussions would be very small. For example, they may be try to depress the price to see what happens to the network when miners are starved for income. They may also drive the BTC prices up in order to observe and quantify FOMO. There could be a large number of discrete tests happening today - there's no real way to know. 

If BTC survives this period of 'destructive' experimentation (and the capitalization of BTC grows large enough that it's collapse would have meaningful economic consequences) it is likely that this testing will end and the focus of government manipulation of the BTC price will shift to stabilization.

Does HODL makes BTC just a receipt for a fiat donation to miners?,"I'm a long time HODLer and I love some of the articles posted on [https://nakamotoinstitute.org](https://nakamotoinstitute.org)

I read something on Twitter that made me think: assuming none of us are actually spending the Bitcoin, merchant adoption keeps dropping and we're all HODLing, does that make our BTC just a receipt for a fiat donation to miners?

I know BTC has a use for those making illegal transactions in oppressive environments like in Venezuela, but I'm questioning the rationale of HODLing if all I'm getting in return is a reminder of how much I donated to the network (since centralized solutions are always faster and more convenient for legal payments). I guess HODL is good if I expect the demand to continue increasing, but I'm not sure why that should be the case if most of the world doesn't have a use for a decentralized currency.",1530238364,29/06/2018 02:12:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8uphme/does_hodl_makes_btc_just_a_receipt_for_a_fiat/,1

Speculation: Facebook/Coinbase Rumors and how awful it would be for Bitcoin,"Rumors seem to be gaining steam that Facebook could be interested in buying Coinbase. My friends and I have debated for the past 24 hours what true value the acquisition could give FB in an industry still in infancy. Regardless if you've bought bitcoin or follow cryptocurrencies, I would say that it's almost certain than the void of the internet-of-money should be rapidly closing and this is very widely believed. Middlemen like Visa, PayPal, etc. are incredibly overpaid for their services by their customers and significantly compensated for the data they sell back to advertisers. 

My initial reaction was that it'd obviously bring FB into the space like thunder and they could realize value almost immediately by reducing FOREX/Tax exposure on their app/marketplace sales. You would also be opening a platform to nearly 2 billion people and claiming relatively high transaction fees for the retail investors it would likely attract (speculators paying $1.49 for buying a small $25 ""investment"" in bitcoin). That would deliver some nice revenue for FB, but I don't think it's there play with the acquisition. 

For the purposes of this argument we can assume that should FB enter the cryptocurrency space, it would undoubtably wield a lot of power and resources to both convince advertisers and merchants on the future potential of the technology. 

It's important to point out that nearly all Coinbase accounts are not true bitcoin wallets. Coinbase is a custodian, just like a bank, and you don't own access to the private keys (in almost every case). It's also likely that retail adopters do not posses the level of aptitude to ever full understand the benefits that Bitcoin's cryptography provides (hence the popularity of Coinbase) and are likely fine with not controlling their private key. 

**If Facebook were to buy Coinbase, they'd have granular level data into all historical purchases their users have ever made.**

Certainly, they already have a lot of this high level data through use of tokens, cookies, apis, etc. But they don't have this level of granularity. 

How could they become successful at this? Simple, by eating Tx fees. This provides obvious benefit to the merchant because they're no longer shilling out 2-5&amp;#37; on Visa, Square, etc. FB would recoup their fee exposure by selling profiles built from your consumption trends. 

This of course would be bittersweet. People who maintain their own wallets and private keys would still maintain some level of anonymity, but such a move would be tremendously detrimental to the value in which Bitcoin was founded. I realize this was long winded, but hoped to stimulate some dialog. 

TL; DR: Facebook buying Coinbase would allow them to build profiles on everything their users have ever purchased. ",1530238858,29/06/2018 02:20:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8upjhp/speculation_facebookcoinbase_rumors_and_how_awful/,1

How does increasing block size promote centralization of the network?,"I know this is a piping hot debate in the Bitcoin community. But I hope any readers understand I'm genuinely looking for answers and trying to promote discussion. 

After seeing the transaction pool swell up so greatly in December (if I recall,$30-$40 per transaction (crazy!!!)) It seemed pretty obvious that Bitcoin wasn't anywhere NEAR ready for the mass adoption that we all dream of it eventually having. I know solutions such as LN have emerged, and while I haven't given a lot of time researching these alternate solutions, I do wonder how and why a bigger block size hasn't occured in the main BTC chain.

A large argument against block size increase I've read is this creates an increase in centralization. My question is how and why? A mining farm with 30% hash power has just as much control in a block size of 1mb as it would in a 16mb, 0.5mb, or any other size block, right? Maybe I'm not understanding something there.

Anyways, I'm curious to hear some knowledge on this. ",1530248317,29/06/2018 04:58:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8uqhad/how_does_increasing_block_size_promote/,1

Outcome: Onramps and offramps have been cut off by the government so people can't use white money. Bitcoin holders are now offering to sell Bitcoin in Black money in Cash at a premium of around 30%. People are actually buying at such a high price because if citizens can't use their own money the way they want, what's the value of such money. Some(very few) are offering services in exchange of crypto so they don't have to disclose or pay taxes. 

Let this be a lesson to anyone who thinks government's can ban cryptocurrency. You can't ban Bitcoin out of your economy. You'll instead ban your own money out of bitcoin based economy.

The Relationship between HODLing and Mainstream Usage of Bitcoin,"I have been lurking reddit and in the bitcoin community for 3 years and with its ups and downs, I have been on a really wild ride.

First and foremost, I want to point out that although I believe in the intrinsic value and positive aspects bitcoin brings to the world, there are also negative aspects. Even if no system is entirely perfect, I do believe that bitcoin has more than a fair chance to be adopted much more widely and put to good use, hence increasing it's value.

Ever since beginning 2017 or so (or sooner, or later, don't know exactly), many people have almost chosen sides on whether HODLing is a good phenomenon or a negative one for the bitcoin community and it's development. People argue that hodling is bad because it doesn't help adoption of bitcoin. On the other hand some others claim that hodling increases it's value.

I want to give you my perspective because I have a business that has been accepting bitcoin and ETH since late 2015. I have no coding skills, nor am I a graduate of enigneering... in fact I never even went to university.

Some of you can call me a hodler because I do not sell my bitcoin, I only keep stacking in up. I havent sold any during the 20k peak of late last year. Whatever bitcoin I amass I keep, and people who want to take advantage of my discounts when using crypto will buy bitcoins in order to pay me. In the end, many other people in my line of work also started accepting cryptos and the community surrounding our domain is now almost entirely run on cryptocurrency as default payment method (most notably bitcoin).

That means our customers are constantly paying us with bitcoins, which means they are constantly buying it from someone else.

Now I can obviously just loop the bitcoins back to them at a fee, since they want to remain discreet as buyers and believe it offers more anonymity than paying with paypal or a credit card (whether or not this is true is an entire other subject of discussion and I am not discussing that in this post). But if I would do that, I would just close this community off from any external communities that wish to make bitcoin more mainstream and actually used as a payment method.

So I just wanted to give my 2 cents out there and say that I am both contributing to bitcoin's adoption as a currency but also a long-term hodler. I am both. Even if I have nothing to contribute in terms of code or technology that can propel bitcoin further because I have no technical skills whatsoever, I do believe I help in terms of the adoption as a currency.

I have never posted here, but it did feel good to say this!",1530257693,29/06/2018 07:34:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8urane/the_relationship_between_hodling_and_mainstream/,1

Providing Liquidity for Sellers Makes Bitcoin More Valuable,"The reason that Bitcoin will eventually become a stable currency has to do with how much liquidity is available for sellers at steady prices.

So even though buyers are speculating that they will be able to sell at a higher price at a future date, they are also providing liquidity to a seller which is providing a service to that seller by making bitcoin an effective store of value.  

If you have an interest in the success of Bitcoin as a stable currency you help every time you help a seller cash out.  With enough users that risk should become a self-fulfilling prophesy as to the value of Bitcoin.  Supply,Demand, Number of Users, Buyers and Sellers are the variables.  More demand, fixed supply, more users, and steady buys and sells mathmatically assure a very high price.

It should also be considered that passive money is increasing everyday because of human nature.  Brute force deflation might be enough by itself to push the price up without having to depend on constant growth.  I think there is a lot of reason to be optimistic that Bitcoin is a good longterm investment even now.

Let's clear this up with empirical evidence: Bitcoin doesn't need to be spent to have value.,"*Why Bitcoin does not need to be spent*

The world has approximately $700-800T in non-derivative assets. This includes real estate, equities, bonds, commodities, cash, and all the bits of stuff people use in their daily lives. The majority of those assets are not used to trade with.

Take a look at this classic (yet flawed) infographic: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-much-money-exists-in-the-entire-world-in-one-chart-2015-12-18


Cash, as in the type you can hold in your hand, make up about $8T

Cash, as in the type you keep in a bank account, makes up about $90T


That means 6 out of 7 of the world's assets are not used as a unit of account. If you consider your own assets, you will probably find a similar ratio of cash-to-other-stuff (investments, real estate, cars). 6 out of 7 units of value in the world have their value from something other than their ability to be a unit of account.


In order to have a large inherent value, bitcoin need only have a niche of a niche of the utility of any of the asset classes listed in that infographic. If Bitcoin can replace a small fraction of the utility of cash, gold, equities, debt, or derivatives, it will have trillions of dollars in value. It just so happens that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies compete in all of these asset markets. Are they better than existing assets? For certain use cases, definitely. For all use cases? Probably not. Being useful in certain use cases is enough in a mature market to justify a value for Bitcoin many times what it is.


*Why Bitcoin's largest value is hodling*

I bought a gold coin with my bitcoin recently, and while holding the coin, I took another coin of local currency of almost the exact same size and compared the gold coin and the currency coin. It dawned on me that both were shiny metal, and to a child would be equivalent, but the gold coin represents over 4000x the value of the currency coin to the market.

If you reflect on this, you can see that a primary value of gold is that it is a compact and efficient way to store non-inflationary value. In this regard, Bitcoin is far more efficient. Bitcoin has no weight and is more difficult to lose or steal.

Gold justifies an $8T market cap, and most gold is hedled by governments in their reserves. These reserves store gold as opposed to tin or iron or oil because it is more efficient to store and transport gold than anything else physical. In this regard, if Bitcoin replaced even a fraction of world reserves, it would justify a few trillion dollars.

Furthermore, bitcoin is far more liquid than gold. If I would like to sell my gold coin right now, I will guarantee a loss because there is a spread of approximately 10%-20%.  This is because shipping and storage of physical gold costs money for traders. With bitcoin, the spread can be as little as 0.01%, which is an indicator of its high liquidity.

Experienced commodities traders may note that perhaps I should have bought a contract for gold settled in cash. I will get to that!

With potentially better properties for hodling than gold and cash-like liquidity, Bitcoin is more like a savings account than gold or cash. If Bitcoin is truly better than a normal savings account, which I believe it is, it is likely that Bitcoin and crypto can justify $20T-50T market caps. In a mature market many years away, that's 100-200x current values without much usage as a payment method or unit of account.

To sum it up, it is great that Bitcoin is useful in so many ways, but don't discount what Bitcoin is best at: saving! There is a lot of demand for savings accounts in the world. Even governments need to save! Maybe one day in a few years a small government will open a savings account in Bitcoin. :)",1530262788,29/06/2018 08:59:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8uro8o/lets_clear_this_up_with_empirical_evidence/,1

The bear market community,"First of all, do with your money what you want. If you want to sell your coins, do it. If you think it's the best time to buy, do it. And what comes next is just my opinion.

I think it's really funny how many people in this reddit changed their mind about crypto in a short time. Prices are falling, people are losing money, not a good time I understand. But why are so many offending others in this reddit because they don't follow the mainstream? It seems like EVERYBODY knows prices will fall further. EVERYBODY is so smart to sell now (in some cases with losses) and EVERYBODY will buy back when prices are low enough. And if you don't do what EVERYBODY does you are not smart or stupid. The same people who follow the mainstream now asked this reddit months ago if buying BTC at 18k was not to late, and EVERYBODY said it will moon to 100k easily.

What I want to say is: don't follow everybody. Not everybody can get rich. Some smart people will take advantage of the whole crowd making the same decisions and I promise you, they will get rich and steal your money. Think for yourself, have your own opinion. 

Perhaps it is smarter to be against everybody sometimes even if you are attacked by them. ",1530265445,29/06/2018 09:44:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8urvjk/the_bear_market_community/,1

Heineken holds many different kinds of IPRs, such as HEINEKEN wordmark (US trademark No. 956608 for 32 class), HEINEKEN logo figurative trademark (US trademark No. 1342529 for 16, 18, 21, 25, 26, 28, 34 classes), among others. Any exploitation (including but not limited to the use) of Heineken’s IPRs must be expressly authorized by my client.

[ELI5] Why Bitcoin Core Wallet doesn't use 12/24 words seeds as a back up method?,"Newbie here. I've purchased very small amount of btc last week and now I'm kinda' worried about where to store these with proper backup since I'm planning to continuously invest small amount every now and then. 

Among all the back-up methods, I find mnemonic seeds are most user-friendly for non-tech-savvy persons like me. Also, I really don't have to worry about changed addresses after every transaction. My question is that how come Bitcoin Core Wallet doesn't support 24 words seeds like electrum or some other wallets? I've read somewhere that you have to update wallet.dat file after every 100 transactions because of the changed addresses in Bitcoin Core (I may be wrong, I'm very non-tech-savvy and newbie in crypto).

Note:  I know hardware wallets are the most secured way to store. But I have very small amount and don't want to be bothered with Hardware Wallet at this moment. ",1530283982,29/06/2018 14:53:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8utqll/eli5_why_bitcoin_core_wallet_doesnt_use_1224/,1

Make a point of spending Bitcoin.,"Many people are reluctant to spend their Bitcoin because they are afraid of missing out on future gains. In order for Bitcoin to succeed people need to spend it and as many of us as possible should make a point of spending it. 

One easy way to do this without actually reducing your holdings is to keep a small amount of fiat, say $200, on an exchange. Then when you see a product or service you want that can be bought with Bitcoin, buy it with Bitcoin. You can then go to the exchange and buy back an equivalent amount of Bitcoin. I will be purchasing VPN service like this as soon as my fiat arrive at the exchange.

2. I’ve slways suspected that stock market analysis is a BS. Bitcoin proved it 100%. “Based on every technical analysis it will go up” - you see it goes down next day. They’re all just guessing.

Riot Blockchain: How This Bitcoin Company Might Strike It Rich,"Hey everybody! My name is Malcolm Rose and I like to write about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lately I've taken an interest in the intersection between Bitcoin and the old-school trading world of the stock market. 

While many of us in the crypto-world tend to shrug our shoulders when told about Bitcoin companies and ETFs and so on, it's important to keep in mind that this is one very effective way to get people enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. Make no mistake: **this is very good for adoption**.

People who are comfortable with their trading platforms do not have to learn a new skill to take an interest - suddenly, an entire untouchable demographic is involved and engaged. Those of us who are crypto-veterans often find it easy to underestimate what an intimidating learning curve Bitcoin still has - this is, in fact, the main reason why I write my educational articles!

Previously I wrote about a dumpster-fire of a cryptocurrency company called Longfin. Since then I decided to get more positive and focus on a company that I think is doing things right. Riot Blockchain is an American company which is focused on both Bitcoin mining and various ""targeted investments"" in the crypto world, such as acquiring ownership interests in up-and-coming exchanges and the like.

So, long story short, I've written an article about this company. I'd love to get some feedback and hear from the community what you guys think. Without further ado, I give you:

Aworker Review: Hiring On The Blockchain,"Aworker is very similar to pre-existing online job finding applications. Users create an account, verify their skills, and upload it to the Aworker blockchain database. Companies who are searching for employees put out open positions and list prerequisites for employment.


The difference between Aworker and other online competitors is that Aworker uses an AI to automatically match the best candidates for the job, which means that the recruiting company has less work to do on their end. Additionally, users on the network can recommend friends for certain job positions, and if their friend gets interviewed or hired, they can receive WORK tokens. These WORK tokens can be traded on exchanges or used on the Aworker network to gain perks.


    Reduces Cost Per Hire: By handling everything through the blockchain, HR departments don’t have to spend as much time and money looking for qualified applicants. Traditionally, they would have to pay lots of money for advertisements and outreach just to get in touch with skilled individuals.
    AI Matching: The Aworker AI automatically matches open job positions with the best-qualified candidates. This is helpful for both parties, as it cuts down on the amount of time that they spend searching, and gives them custom-tailored results.
    Earn Money For Recommendations: If you’re browsing through jobs on your Aworker account and see something that would be a perfect fit for your friend, you can recommend them to that company. Once the AI approves the match and passes it on to the business, they will have a chance at an interview. If your friend gets hired, you get paid.


What Issue Does it Solve?

Many western nations are experiencing an unprecedented labor shortage. It’s becoming harder and harder for companies to find qualified and skilled labor whether they’re searching for industrial employees or graduate-level skillset. With Aworkers AI-powered matching system, companies and potential recruits spend less time browsing their options, and more time looking at pre-approved matches.

Bitcoin 2013-14 Historical Statistics Repeating itself?,"Hi,

Bitcoin had a 78% decrease from 2013 all time high from around $1200 to $250. All time high for 2013 was on Nov 30th. To get to $250 boring volatility it took 1 and a half years and a further 6 months wait to see some uptrend totalling 2 years to wait to catch the slow bull train from the 1st train station stop. In summary this bear market lasted 2 years.

The 2017 crazy bull market started from May 1st 2017 from $1300 all the way to $20000 in Dec 2017 that took 8 months. This is 1438% increase. If we do get another bull run like this passing 20k all time high then new ATH will be $288000 in Dec 2021 then a repeat 78% retracement of this $over a quarter million figure? Isn't this bad health for bitcoin?

So using these statistics is it best to buy bitcoin at $4400 by boarding the 1st train stop departure in June 2019?

I know I will get a reply saying bitcoin's popularity and exposure wasn't as big in 2013-14 compared to now however can someone give me reasons why history wont repeat itself?

I know I will get another reply saying bitcoin died many times in past and survived however everyone knows this latest crash from 20k so how can bitcoin survive from this well exposed crash high from the sky?

Has the 78% crash from 20000 to 4400 scared the average public away to invest in it?

What must bitcoin do to gain the confidence from public again apart from lightning network and store door front logos appearing everywhere? Will it be the upcoming another economic recession like in 2007/8? Will average public able to afford bitcoin in a economic recession? Also how we stop average public driving up prices by 1438% in the future as it's not healthy growth.

My final question is how can bitcoin have a steady slow healthy growth without 78%'s retracements in its future?",1530313813,29/06/2018 23:10:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8uxk6x/bitcoin_201314_historical_statistics_repeating/,1

Wasn’t Bitcoin under $2k like just a year ago?,"I’m mostly a lurker and spectator. 

Seems like all of a sudden I’m hearing people say that Bitcoin is done but it’s still worth about 3x more than a year or so ago... for the longest time people were satisfied with under $2k but now that its correcting people are losing their minds?

Is this mostly people that started to invest late and are just not satisfied that it isn’t continuing to grow at unreal rates?  

Mining is still lucrative at this price in my opinion.

"Bought some with friends, how do we divide our Satoshis?","Okay so I just made my first purchase and I'm very excited. But I made it with friends through a lump sum, my friends didn't have a wallet, so i told them to pay me back in cash, and I would send them their bitcoins after they create an account.

So what happened was last night I was watching when the dip happened and got really excited, and told a few friends (let's say two?) and we each put different amounts to add up to a total (let's say $110), how would I properly divide them up, since bitcoin fluctuates so wildly?

It's going to take a few days to process I'm assuming, and I have a ton of questions:

* how many satoshis do I even have?
* how do i calculate this?
* let's say my first friend X bought $20 worth, my 2nd friend Y bought $40 worth, and I bought $50 (Z). when I get the bitcoins in my bank account on top of what I already have, how do I 1) find out how much I had before my friends bitcoins arrived in my account and 2) calculate how much bitcoins they are owed? or would it be easier to just send them $10 worth of bitcoin? they bought it during the dip, so i'm wondering if it's possible to calculate whatever their share ($10 at the time of purchase) plus the growth (or loss) before i send it to them through the app.

tl;dr: friends and i pooled money together to buy during dip, how do i math",1530328884,30/06/2018 03:21:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8uz28t/bought_some_with_friends_how_do_we_divide_our/,1

Regret minimization,"Lets do a thought experiment to keep ourselves honest. Suppose you have some significant &amp;#37; or your money in Bitcoin and you understand the basic value proposition of Bitcoin as the internet of value transfer. Now suppose one of these scenarios comes to pass:

Scenario A: a bitcoin is worth 100k in two years

Scenario B: a bitcoin is worth $17.21 in two years. 

If you sold all of your bitcoin today, would you be able to live with yourself in scenario A? 

If you HODL your bitcoin (in the true spirit of the original drunken forum post), would you be able to live with yourself in scenario B?

Just for a moment here, don't look to each other for guidance. Forget all of the speculation and the taunting and the bullshit. Ignore these sock puppets and this propaganda and this drama and make up your own mind because THAT has always been the true spirit of Bitcoin.

and what about subsequent invoices? Do I need to spend again or I can do as many tx as I want under $100? How does this work? I setup a node etc but having trouble receiving.",1530342440,30/06/2018 07:07:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8v06iv/ln_network_question/,1

Question about the reward transaction,"I would like ask more details about the reward transaction. The one created by the miner to get its reward after mining a block. 

So, in order to get the reward transaction digitally signed, we need a special wallet, let's call it here ""blockchain wallet"". That third-party wallet is used for security matters I suppose. Please correct if I am wrong. 

My question is about the ""blockchain wallet"" that signs the reward transactions. Could you provide more details about it? It's not clear to me. For example, I wonder if this blockchain wallet has its keypair public or private. By being private, only ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" would have the private key of the blockchain wallet used to sign the reward transactions. By being public, everyone could check out the private key.

Thanks",1530343801,30/06/2018 07:30:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8v0a3l/question_about_the_reward_transaction/,1

Been hit in massively the head with a giant red dildo made of pure evil, I now owe around 100k in taxes. I have never seen the gains I apparently should have. This is messed up. So be careful with how much you trade, if you use trade bots etc. Also keep track of everything you do.

Bitcoin : The first digital life form,"***Bitcoin*** *is the first example of a new form of life. It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform. It lives because anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It lives because all the running copies are constantly talking to each other. It lives because if any one copy is corrupted it is discarded, quickly and without any fuss or muss. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can see its code and see exactly what it does.-*  **Ralph Merkle**

Beware of this kind of scam,"Yesterday I got a call from a person who seemed to be quite sophisticated. He told me that he belonged to a mining company and needs to sell 10+ BTC on a daily basis. He gave me a very good rate (\~10&amp;#37; less than the market price) plus a bonus if I dealt on a regular basis.  Then he told me that he can save escrow fees by using [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet and insisted in trading using that system else he wont trade. Since, I hadn't used [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet, I didn't know this feature existed there :/ He began explaining me how it works. Here it goes - First I'll have to create a wallet there. Then I would have to send him the wallet id and password. Then he'll send bitcoins to the wallet which is protected by an ""escrow key"". Thereafter, I can change the password of my [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) account to make sure he cannot open my wallet anymore. I smelled something very very fishy  still gave the man the benefit of doubt as I hadn't used [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) wallet and told him to show me a demo by doing a transaction of $1 worth bitcoins. He agreed and I gave him the credentials of a demo account. Then he told me to confirm an email authorizing login from an unknown browser. I did it as it was a demo account and a demo email id too. Soon he told me to login to my wallet and click on send. I could see a ""watch-only"" address with balance of 0.002 BTC and needed a private key to send funds from that wallet. He told me that I already had the bitcoins in my wallet and needed that private key or ""escrow key"" which he would tell after I had sent him money. I was astonished to how dumb this scam is. But realised that many don't know what a private key is and can easily fall to this scam. Always know that **""not your keys, not your funds"".**",1530363452,30/06/2018 12:57:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8v1o4r/beware_of_this_kind_of_scam/,1

"To appreciate Bitcoin, it helps to understand ""money"" and the serious problems inherent in the current global banking system.","Money is just a general purpose IOU.  There are various forms of money, some are much better than others.  Bitcoin, like gold, is a form of ""good money"".  Good money must have all of the following seven properties:

1. Durable
2. Divisible
3. Portable
4. Fungible
5. Recognizable
6. **Rare**
7. **Difficult to Counterfeit**

Fiat money is not rare because it it not difficult (for bankers) to create counterfeits by the trillions.  History has shown, again and again, that fiat money always ends up going to zero, becoming worthless over time.

"Steel man argument, Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash.","Just wrote this at https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@crrdlx/steel-man-bitcoin.


In a recent blog post at https://medium.com/@seweso/small-block-steel-man-f9109ac7ab Wouter Schut analyzed the BCT versus BCH debate. His analysis came across to me as being objective and thoughtful—things that seem rarely present in this debate.

Schut frames the article as a “steel man” toward the small block or Bitcoin Core argument. That is, he is attempting to explain why small blocks or Bitcoin Core is inferior by announcing their best-laid arguments. “Steelmanning,” apparently tries to argue against something by, oddly, outlining the other side’s most solid, but unstated, arguments. It is helping the weaker arguer by presenting his best evidence that he has failed to present on his own. Frankly, it is unclear to me how this aids one’s own argument, yet that is steelmanning.

For purposes here, though, I admire the civility that was involved in the post.

Wouter lays out seven contentions of small blockers. He purports that these tenets are fundamental to small blockers and Bitcoin Core. I can’t disagree. For sake of scoreboarding, let's take a look.

Extreme consensus. The idea is that if we’re to truly believe in decentralization, a simple majority-rule doesn’t cut it. After all, 50% plus one more person could mean domination over the minority. I like this, but also believe in free market principles and survival-of-the-fittest in the economy. Allowing BCH to spawn, compete, then either survive, dominate, or thrive is the way of the business world. Score +1 for BCH. BTC = 0, BCH = 1.

Centralization risk/cost of bigger blocks. This is a huge problem, in my mind, with BCH. The few and large mining operations, Jihan Wu and China, spit in the face of decentralization. +1 BTC. BTC =1, BCH = 1.

Bad UX and speed on-chain. BCH, no question, for now. This could certainly change though going forward with the Lightning network if it indeed grows in usage. BTC = 1, BCH = 2.

Most transactions are off-chain. This is an interesting idea…that “buying” bitcoin or any crypto on an exchange isn’t really buying it. It’s meting out a deal with the third-party exchange (that is, unless you’re using an exchange like EtherDelta). BTC = 2, BCH = 2.

Store-of-value is more important than MoE. I tend to disagree with the notion here that BTC-folk make this assumption. From the start, both were important. Frankly, this notion of HODLing is more new to the game. Anyone paying attention back in like 2013 will remember many-a-posts on reddit shaming anyone who held onto their BTC rather than using it. The mindset was that the only way to grow bitcoin’s usage and population was to put it to use. Also, bitcoin’s push toward Segwit and Lightning hint that there is a strong desire to make it a method-of-exchange (MoE) for everyday things as well. If the Lightning Network comes to fruition, that may happen. BTC = 3, BCH = 2.

Off-chain does better. Yes*. There is an asterisk here, though. Off-chain also begins to slide away from Satoshi’s original vision. It is less transparent, or not at all, depending on how it is done. As a for-instance, Visa or PayPal are fantastic tools. I use and like them both. But, I have to trust them. Still, off-chain certainly would mean faster and a better user experience overall. The proverbial cup of coffee is all it takes to see this. Paying in BTC on-chain would mean the TX fee is more expensive than the coffee, and/or, you hold up the line for 10 minutes to confirm. Off-chain does better. BTC = 4, BCH = 2.

SPV demands you trust miners. SPV is where a “light client” processes transactions but doesn’t have to download the whole whopping blockchain, just the applicable part. This one is tricky. I don’t think anyone disputes that these light SPV clients are accurate or not. But, as Schut points out in his article, it comes around to governance. Oddly for the BTC crowd, this also undercuts ""extreme consensus"", as Schut alludes. And, as always with money and crypto, it comes back to trust. The miners who run full nodes (they’ve downloaded the full blockchain) are the ones at the foundational level. Anyone running a light node is trusting those full nodes. Like a skyscraper, the 99th floor holds up the top floor, floor 100, but every single floor trusts the foundational level. Big blockers (BCH) would fall victim to non-SPV first, but I’ll call this one a tie because both will eventually crush under their own weight without scaling solutions.

Final score, BTC = 4; BCH = 2

Things change fast in crypto. But, to me the takeaway now is that BCT is either going to have to simply say, “Bitcoin is digital gold, that’s it.” Or, the Lightning Network, or something off-chain, will need to be fully implemented.

Hodlers will not change the world,"There are two opinions in the crypto world: some people consider cryptocurrencies digital gold, while others believe that cryptocurrencies will be used as means of payment.   
   
The first idea is quite convenient. You can just do nothing. For the first time ever, doing nothing has actually become a heroic deed – people are proud to be hodlers, proud to do nothing with their cryptocurrency. But do you really believe this approach will change the world? Seriously?   
   
Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.   
   
So, what should we do? Is there a reason to just sit and wait for cryptocurrencies to grow? I believe there is none. The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.   
   
Personally, I see no other options. However, this cannot be handled by one man alone. The whole crypto community should do this. You may ask: is it possible to live paying with cryptocurrencies only? Judging from our experience –  yes. Moreover, we have video proof: here is a story of a guy from Zurich [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb\_yVnkHSFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb_yVnkHSFs) and here is a story of a guy from Thailand [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck).   
   
People will say I’m biased, since I founded a project where you can sell and buy goods for crypto. Yes, it’s true. Still, I’m more interested in expansion of cryptocurrencies than in my project’s expansion. In fact, I founded it for one simple reason: I’m sure that hodlers will never change the world. But we will. We should just learn from the guys in our videos who pay with cryptocurrencies in everyday life and make cryptocurrencies valuable.   ",1530378887,30/06/2018 17:14:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8v3agv/hodlers_will_not_change_the_world/,1

is there a bitcoin exchange that allows you to place a 'buy order' at current exchange rate and pay later,"i have a business idea, not really bitcoin dependent but to add this feature would be very beneficial.

***1:01pm*** \- exchange rate of  **BTCUSD** is** 6321.**7

***1:01pm*** \- place a **""sell order""** to sell 1BTC for USD  at the current rate of** BTCUSD 6321.**7    *** and but not pay YE***T

***1:05pm*** \- exchange rate changes. **BTCUSD** is** 6208.**1

***1:05pm*** \- transferred bitcoins are now in wallet and available to trade

***1:06pm*** \- pay off the sell order at the previous rate **BTCUSD 6321.7** because that was the rate at which i put the ""sell order""

i did a finance course and i can vaguely recall traders being able to enter into contacts at the current exchange rate and pay later and no matter how much the market fluctuates in the future they still trade under the agreed rate ",1530387073,30/06/2018 19:31:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8v4bc8/is_there_a_bitcoin_exchange_that_allows_you_to/,1

How I think bitcoin will really go mainstream,"I believe Thomas Jefferson said roughly that mankind is disposed to suffering while evils are sufferable. 
I think this describes our world in relation to the current financial system. Yep current system works but it’s burdensome, heavy, and doesn’t work to maximize humanity. Credit cards add arguably too much extra weight on businesses as well. 

I think that coming soon we’ll experience an economic meltdown down like never before. I think that an economic crisis that rattled the government and the people in the US and thus world wide is what it will take for (sadly) complacent people’s to say we need something different so this xywhatever-issue doesn’t happen again.

"Bitcoin will be the ""Currency of Time""...","It is my strong belief that ""Time"" is the most valuable resource that we Humans have access to...  


As Neil deGrasse Tyson so eloquently quoted ""[Time is defined to make motion look simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPOR55M_P0)""; what he's saying here is that the only reason we have a ""need"" for the concept of ""Time"" is to allow us a unit of measurement to describe motion effectively...

There is evidence that Time is our most valuable resource when you look back in History: The first accountants were ""time-keepers"" ie. the first astronomers! They first used motion to delineate a unit of time by realizing the Sun that rises and falls, this is presumably the first unit of time ever invented. This smaller unit of measurement (day) was used to delineate and measure other movements of greater celestial objects and eventually it helped us figure out where we were in the galaxy! It is no coincidence the first accountants were accountants of time or ""time-keepers"", it is VALUABLE!  


[A drawing of early astronomers, accounting for \\""Time\\"" by using the motion of celestial bodies...](https://i.redd.it/wsztcwo697711.jpg)

They knew not what they were measuring, but they didn't need to know, they saw something repeat; thus a unit of time was created... If you have something that repeats predictably, you've created a time-keeping mechanism...  


One could argue that Time is the only resource we truly ""have"", but one could also successfully debate that ""Time"" itself is a tool to help us accomplish things more predictably, thus preserving a bit of Time... This is quite literally the only use we have for Time, it is primarily why we invented it back when our ancestors looked at stars...

If something saves you time, it is money... The reason is because Time IS money... When you buy a pack of bubble gum, you are buying the time necessary to create that product. When you work, you get paid for your time. Time IS money... This is why when you give somebody money and then wait a few years, you should expect a return of some kind, you gave them the money PLUS the time, this is the entire reason why ANY interest EVER is paid on ANYTHING... TIME!  


The man who can waste somebody else's time is truly wicked, but that is a subject for a different post, let's get right to the Hero:  


Lightning Network  


Now that you know the importance of time, and therefore money, you should see the potential lying dormant in the Lightning Network...  


When BILLIONS of people around the world can transact near instantaneously, we will see a compound interest effect upon both the time AND money savings that are offered to ALL of Humanity...

We have planes that can cross the Atlantic Ocean faster than any form of Global Money; this is truly unacceptable for the 21st Century, Lightning Network will solve this problem, and it will do it quickly...  


HyperBitcoinization was never just about ""fast-money"", it was about ""fast-everything""...  


Buckle up butter-cup, the future is coming!

SEGWIT &amp; LIGHTNING = Scalability,"Why is Bitcoin so conservative with their technical upgrades. Bitcoin said at 1mb so miners don’t have too much power over nodes. Miners will always be there no matter what. They just chase the auto issuance of bitcoin every 10 minutes. If they drop out, difficulty adjustment takes place. Do miners aren’t that significant. They do as told. 

Segwit came out over a year ago. Why can’t nodes who control the consensus rules, mandate segwit?! It’s going to happen eventually; it’s better tech; it’s needed to scale for Lightning. It’s only at 40% after s year!!

Why? Bitcoin is developing at a snails pace in a rapidly evolving world. Mandate Segwit! Get Lightning operational so when Bitcoin gets its second chance this November, people are paying $50 fees again! 

Bitcoin will only get a certain amount of chances for the masses to test it. ",1530392143,30/06/2018 20:55:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8v4vqu/segwit_lightning_scalability/,1
CafePress competitor accepting bitcoin?,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew of a competitor/similar service to CafePress/Zazzle/RedBubble that accepts bitcoin. 

(These are basically screenprinting-on-demand sites where you can design custom T-shirts, mugs, etc, list them on a ""store,"" and your customers can come buy them.) 

I emailed RedBubble out of curiosity and they said it might be a future option. Maybe we can start to put the pressure on some of these companies? Would love if supporters of my project (who are mostly crypto users also) could buy my merchandise with bitcoin.
