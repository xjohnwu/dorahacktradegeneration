.1 btc on nfc tags at 3 locations in the US,"lets try this again. for a bit of background you can read my post history. note that i am not a 5 day redditor.

facts: 

this is a treasure hunt.

these are black circular nfc tags with private keys on them.  these were placed some time ago so there is a real chance they are gone.  do not over invest in the process with subsequent disappointment.

the tags are placed in some pretty out of the way locations. this was requested last time

holbrook az: the best italian bar in town.

palm desert ca: do you like firemen who make great food?

albuquerque nm: this is the best italian coffee in town.

as mentioned earlier. will reward public picture posts of proven winners with a special prize for the first to find.

public keys so you can watch:

if you find one and i made an error transcribing please send the key and I can probably correct. this happened to someone last time.

spam or begging in pm or public will get you nowhere.

Why you should own crypto regardless of price.,"

Have you ever actually been in control of your money? I mean in control to the point where it’s actually yours? There are banks who currently won’t let you transfer “your” money to an organization. A bank will not let you wire transfer “your” money over a daily limit. If 100% of people tried to withdrawal “their” money from a bank the banks would implode. 

Owning Gold or silver is physically owning “your” money. 

Owning crypto is digitally owning “your” money. 

It’s yours. That’s an odd thing to say. 

And that is something that is rare in today’s society. 

No one actually owns “their” money. 

Own crypto in good times and the price may or may not rise. But you... actually own your money.. 

 Own crypto in the bad times and you may be one of the few who actually owned.. “your” money to begin with.

"The movie ""Too Big To Fail"" is the greatest advertisement for Bitcoin ever created","So we all know Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis, which is covered well in the HBO movie, Too Big To Fail.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend.  

Specifically, there is one scene where William Hurt, playing Treasury Secretary Hank Paulsen, is talking to his wife about the possible collapse of the financial system.  In it he describes how it would happen and how it's all built on trust and banks lending to other banks, if one domino goes they all go, and pretty soon the average Joe will be worrying about the money in his bank and smashing ATMs.

The whole time he's talking I'm just thinking about how if we had a system built on Bitcoin and the blockchain, no one would have to worry like that.  Their money would be safely in their wallet, unmovable without their consent.  NO WOULD WOULD HAVE TO TRUST ANYONE IN ORDER FOR THE SYSTEM TO WORK!

How is that not an objectively better reality?  Instead, this man, Hank Paulsen, acted in ways that led to TRILLIONS in taxpayer money (*your money!*) to give to the very people whose greed and recklessness caused the failure and suffering in the first place.

Bitcoin is going to change lives, because people are going to want what it has to offer.",1533083913,01/08/2018 00:38:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93k5ch/the_movie_too_big_to_fail_is_the_greatest/,1

Multiple exchanges denying me access to their platform... Advice greatly appreciated...,"I opened up a Coinbase account on July 17th. A few days later I attempted to purchase Bitcoin. I received an email locking me in at the price I purchased at and when funds would be made available. 

The following morning I woke up to a couple emails. One said my bank cancelled the order and the other said Coinbase did. I immediately called my bank and was told they never received a payment request.

After multiple calls to Coinbase and emails, I was told that it was a security measure on their end, but they fixed it and I wouldn't have any issues moving forward, and that I would be able to to continue exchanging after a couple days. A couple days had passed and after another phone call, I was told I had to wait 7 days for an account specialist to fix the issue.

In the meantime, I decided to add money to my 'USD Account' while waiting for my exchange privileges to be reinstated. Went through with another email saying when funds would be available and again, woke up the following morning to another chain of emails stating it was cancelled.

Today, I received an email from the account specialist saying that I am not eligible to trade and they cannot tell me why.

While waiting for that that email, I signed up through Abra. My account was verified and everything looked good, until I added my bank and my account wasn't able to send money. I emailed them and received the same type of email... ""You can't trade and we can't tell you why""

WTF?! Could it be because I share a bank account with my girlfriend? Maybe it's a red flag? I don't know. The only other option I can think of is using Local bitcoins and storing into a hardwallet.

Bitcoin Giants Turn A Blind Eye To U.S. Regulator’s ETF Rejection,"## The Rejection's Baseline 

The SEC largely based its disapproval on Act Section 6(b)(5), that wants that the rules of a national security exchange be immediately made so as to control manipulative and hokey-pokey acts and practices and also to maximumly secure investors and the public interest at large. 

That said, the SEC rejection wasn't unanimous (3-1). Becoming the first time in history, an SEC commissioner announced herself publicly to be more sympathetic to BTC.

Comparing results of one year of daily purchases vs. weekly purchases through Coinbase,"I've been purchasing BTC here and there since 2016. At times I've convinced myself that I should just set up regular buy-ins and forget about it, but - to my knowledge - the only platform that easily allows scheduled buys from USD is Coinbase.


Coinbase's fees are high, so I've never set this up. But tonight I got curious as to where I'd be if I had done this anyhow, despite the fees.


I used data provided by investing.com for historical BTC data, and decided to do a quick comparison -- $5 per day, every day, from Aug. 1, 2017 until Aug. 1, 2018 versus $35 per week, every week for the same period.


Coinbase charges $0.99 per transaction when buying $5 worth of BTC and $1.99 per transaction when buying $35 worht of BTC.
These are the results ---



*Daily $5 purchase for one year:*
Total Cost in USD = $1830
Total BTC Purchased = 0.2129803918
Total Value of BTC in USD (@ $7599.80 per 1 BTC) = $1610.089


Total Fees in USD = 362.34
Total Fees in BTC = 0.052581194
Total BTC Purchased if Zero Fees = 0.2655615858
Total Value of BTC in USD  if Zero Fees (@ $7599.80 per 1 BTC) = $28467.22


-----


*Weekly $35 purchase for one year:*
Total Cost in USD = 1820
Total BTC Purchased = 0.2406970792
Total Value of BTC in USD (@ $7562.70 per 1 BTC) = $1820.32


Total Fees in USD = $103.48
Total Fees in BTC = 0.01451036618
Total BTC Purchased if Zero Fees = 0.2552074453
Total Value of BTC in USD (@ $7562.70 per 1 BTC) = $1930.06


-----


So, purchasing daily nets significantly higher total fees and a negative ROI. 
Purchasing weekly nets significantly lower total fees, and an almost even ROI.


BUT


If you take fees out of the equation, purchasing daily nets a significantly higher ROI than purchasing weekly does, despite the higher fees.



In Conlusion

How can I set up daily purchases (from USD) without paying such high fees?",1533110947,01/08/2018 08:09:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93n2m8/comparing_results_of_one_year_of_daily_purchases/,1

Satoshi is Black! How hip-hop culture has taken a fancy to Bitcoin,"*Processing img dx90ebrkkgd11...*

*And that one, pullin out gats for fun*  
*But it just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend*  
*Started smokin’ woolies at sixteen*

Life is hard when you’re 16 with gold teeth and not enough money for decent clothes. Especially in a black neighbourhood where 80% live on unemployment benefits and half deal drugs. When you’re going mad because there’s nothing to do and the girls don’t want you because you’re a deadbeat who doesn’t have a gun. 

*Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me*  
*C.R.E.A.M.*  
*Get the money*  
*Dollar, dollar bill y’all*

To try to solve this problem in the past, a black guy would find a gun, rob a grocery store and be put in jail. Or imagine all that to write some verses. After all, hip-hop is the music of self-made men and the oppressed. If Fitzgerald wrote Great Gatsby in the 90s, it would definitely have been accompanied by a dope beat. 

But today black guys are moving to the rhythm of Bitcoin. Oh yeah, baby!

Sometimes it seems that not only Jesus and the US president were black, but Satoshi Nakamoto too. Only a 16-year-old with gold teeth could think up something so hyped that it can lift any sensible guy out of the ghetto and to the moon. No one has to rob grocery stores to have cash, chicks and sweet rides anymore.

"🤑💰😂John McAfee will give $250,000 to anyone who hacks his crypto-wallet 🚀","""To all the skeptics who claim that there is nothing unbreakable, and to the unbelievers that my BitFi wallet is really the first non-breakable device in the world ... I will give a reward of $100,000 to anyone who can hack it. Let the money say, and the scammers go to the forest, ""wrote McAfee.

![img](aac0uz7eugd11)

This strongly resembles another paid advertising campaign of McAfee. After all, to try to crack a crypto-wallet, it must first be bought, and also an additional $50 to transfer the crypto currency to it.

A week later, the reward for breaking the BitFi wallet has already been increased to $250,000. The rules require that you transfer the contents of the BitFi wallet, which the McAfee team will preload and send to you. Initially, you must pay for the purse itself and its contents.

That's how you need to stuff your pockets, probably already for a million ten green sold) 💵

r/Bitcoin recap - July 2018,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I’m back with the nineteenth monthly Bitcoin news recap.


For those unfamiliar, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in bitcoin over the past month.


You can see recaps of the previous months on [Bitcoinsnippets.com](http://bitcoinsnippets.com/)

Question 2: If my reasoning is correct - just like the blockchain was put up, it can also be taken down?   
E.g. they go after the development team and coerce them to take it down or else face severe consequences. Is my reasoning here correct, if not, please explain.",1533126477,01/08/2018 12:27:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93oikq/how_is_bitcoin_truly_immutable_and_why_cant_it_be/,1

Did the data direcotry move?,"I have been running a bitcoin node for several years on an Ubuntu server. My current version is 0.16.2. I use the command: 

**sudo apt-get upgrade**

to keep the package up to date. The data directory bitcoind uses is \~bitcoin/.bitcoin. I think this has always been the case. 

All of a sudden, the upgrade command fails with: 

    Setting up bitcoind (0.16.2-xenial1) ...
    Warning: The home dir /var/lib/bitcoin you specified can't be accessed: No such file or directory

    Errors were encountered while processing:

I guess the system now wants to use /var/lib/bitcoin for the data. Is this a new change or something I have been missing all along? What is the fix to make the upgrade work?

How was UASF relevant? Honest question.,"I still don't get how UASF was relevant in any way. I remember doing the thing - install the node software that would reject blocks that don't signal bit 1. I also remember that only a few percent of nodes did that, none of which were of any mining or economical significance.

And as far as i understand things, the net result on Aug 1 2017 would have been that these few percent of nodes would have forked off and seized up for lack of hashpower, while the larger honeybadger of Bitcoin would have continued on without caring.

How was that supposed to have any effect on the Segwit activation back then? 

I keep hearing that it bluffed the miners into activating BIP91, but that makes no sense because of zero positive or negative technical effect of it.

Were the miners just stupid enough not to realise that?",1533137403,01/08/2018 15:30:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93pypy/how_was_uasf_relevant_honest_question/,1

Free E-commerce Platform that Accepts Bitcoin (No Fees at All),"Hi, guys!

I represent an e-commerce/social network platform called Wheel of Commerce (which you've probably already guessed from my username). We're a free social network for e-commerce made for small businesses that also happens to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Due to the fact that we take no cuts from our users' sales, have no paid plans or anything of the sorts, all transactions are negotiated entirely between vendors and buyers, so you can even make payments in melons if you want to (seriously though, you can actually do that, it doesn't matter to us). The fundamental idea is to create a marketplace that offers its users a free market experience, or as close as you can get to a free market without breaking any laws. We think cryptocurrencies in general, but particularly Bitcoin due to its reliability, have a relevant role to play in helping small businesses expand, particularly in terms of removing any form of middleman, which is a big factor for small business owners who're trying to scale up.

We've just started the phase to evaluate public interest, so really every bit of constructive feedback is appreciated. We're trying to build a ""grassroots kind of thing"", so we're starting to contact small groups who have a potential interest in what we're building. Once we've managed to gather enough interest, we'll launch an equity crowdfunding through Indiegogo, so people who contribute can get a share of our profits. We obviously want to generate money like every other company does, but we want to make the platform as community based as possible, which is why we're posting here.

Anyway, I could go on and on about what we offer, the platform's features, etc., but this post would just end up being unnecessarily extensive, so if you want to check out the details, you can just go to our website: [wheelofcommerce.com](https://www.wheelofcommerce.com/). Liking our Facebook page and following us on Twitter would be greatly appreciated, for basically the already mentioned ""grassroots reason"".

Thanks for your attention. I'll be here to address any questions, suggestions or criticism you guys might have. :)",1533150795,01/08/2018 19:13:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93s02c/free_ecommerce_platform_that_accepts_bitcoin_no/,1
Thought I Helped Mine A Block!,"I saw a post on here last week about someone buying a USB miner to mine for fun. I thought why not. I’m on a military base and I have free power so it can’t hurt. I got the miner all set up and started solo mining on ckpool. Obviously no luck there. So last night I switched to the pool. I wake up this morning and I check Blockchain.info and I see that ckpool found a block over the course of the night. Boy did I get excited thinking I got maybe .000000001 bitcoin. 

Turns out it was all for nothing. I fired up bitcoin core and no incoming transactions. Nothing for my address in the Blockchain as well. Oh well. Back to solo mining and crossing my fingers. That feeling of excitement was pretty awesome though.",1533151036,01/08/2018 19:17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93s1cc/thought_i_helped_mine_a_block/,1

Looking to accept all TOP 100 coins at our restaurants in Miami....asking the crypto-verse for best possible way to do this.,"We have been accepting btc for 5 years and were the first restaurant on the east coast to do so. We were featured on CNN money, Al Jazeera,  Univision and I wore my bitcoin hat on episode of DDD on FOOD NETWORK back in 2014

I have always used small table tents with a QRC code or have texted guest amount request via my servers. It has been great and we have collected well over 150k in crypto in these five years. 

What I want to do is to mass adopt and truly accept all coins, starting with the top 100 and I am looking for the best possible way to do this. My thoughts are making a binder with laminated pages and 10 QRC codes per page but was hoping for a better way.

Thank you all from a HODL’er since 2012

Crypto Price Tracker CoinMarketCap Launches Professional Data Feed fb.me/bitsecret,,1533161407,01/08/2018 22:10:07,http://newsforyou.today/sites/cryptonews/2018/08/crypto-price-tracker-coinmarketcap-launches-professional-data-feed/,1
Another bitcoin price chart with trendline,"I found some data at [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?start=20130428&amp;end=20180801](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?start=20130428&amp;end=20180801)

I plotted that on an Excel spreadsheet and plotted a line to meet the bottom of the curve on semi-log scale. The trend line starts on April 28, 2013 with a value of 1.3 and then increases by 0.00116 every day. So each trendline value =10\^(1.3+(0.00116\*(no. of days after April 28, 2013))). That returned the following values for the following dates:

Jan 1, 2019     $5,079.72

Jan 1, 2020   $13,466.04

Jan 1, 2021   $35,793.00

Jan 1, 2022   $94,885.53

Jan 1, 2023 $251,535.91

ТЕМА ДНЯ: Зачем LocalBitcoins массовые блокировки??? ищем настоящие причины...,"Всем привет! Лично я устала здесь писать с переводчиком) Решила, что, возможно, я тут не одна русскоговорящая )))) Недавно столкнулась с очень неприятной ситуацией: 1) Зарегистрировалась на LocalBitcoins Они затребовали ручную усиленную идентификацию пользователя. 2) выслала им целый список фотографий (""анфас профиль сверху снизу"" lol) 3) Идентификацию прошла. 4) Начала торговлю. Торговала честно. Имела только положительные отзывы. всегда принимала сторону клиента, даже в ущерб себе. Одному даже в долг отпустила биткоины (ну очень умолял прям, обещал вернуть. lol). То есть я ТОЧНО НИЧЕГО МОШЕННИЧЕСКОГО НЕ СОВЕРШАЛА! 100%! 5) на 105 сделке получила блок, причем сайт не давал отпустить клиенту биткоины по сделке. 6) Написала в техподдержку, написала сюда, в Reddit 7) Получила ответ от VeraLocalBitcoins, что мне ответят в тикете в течение дня 8) Биткоины покупателю отпустили (через спор решением в пользу покупателя), ответ жду 9) Получила ответ от техподдержки:

THEME OF THE DAY: Why does LocalBitcoins have massive account blocking? looking for real reasons ...,"Recently encountered a very unpleasant situation: 
1) Registered on LocalBitcoins They requested manual enhanced user identification. 
2) sent them a whole list of photos (""full front profile from the bottom"" lol) 
3) The identification was over. 
4) Started trading. I traded honestly. Had only positive feedback. always took the client's side, even to the detriment of himself. One of them even let go of the bitcoins in debt (well, he pleaded very much, promised to return.) Lol). That is, I did NOT EXACTLY DO NOTHING FRAUD! 100%! 
5) on 105 transactions received a block, and the site did not let the bitcoins be released to the client on the transaction. 
6) I wrote to technical support, I wrote here at Reddit 7) I received a response from VeraLocalBitcoins that I will be answered in the ticket during the day 
8) The buyers were released to the buyer (through a decision in favor of the buyer), the answer is waiting for 
9) I received a response from technical support:

Quanta Signed Contract with BitoEX,"Quanta is excited to announce that a contract has been signed with BitoEX, the major digital asset exchange platform in Taiwan, for the listing of Quanta Network Token Utility (QNTU) as a tradable asset. QNTU will become the 13th token to be listed in BitoPro, BitoEX’s exchange arm, and will be the first token of a foreign project.

BitoEx has made a powerful impact on the industry by launching the Bitcoin-Purchasing Service at convenience stores throughout Taiwan. Enthusiasts can initially buy Bitcoin at over 3,000 Family Mart stores using the existing multi-service touchscreen kiosks, the operational service network later expanded to over 5,000 with new chain stores added. The membership exceeds 250,000, which covers 80% of market share in Taiwan.

“We are very pleased with this opportunity to have QNTU listed on Taiwan’s top exchange, BitoPro. Quanta launched its first product in February 2018 and this is a further achievement for the company. BitoPro is Taiwan’s top exchange so it is a good fit for the business,” says Steven Ormond-Smith, CFO of Quanta.

A Quanta-BitoPro “QNTU Listing Event” will be held on 10 August, 2018 in Taiwan.

Some concerns that don't let me sleep well... please help! :),"I work in a big consulting firm where people in my country who are trying to sell blockchain projects (mainly PoC) don't know about the technical part of it. They are even asking me to think of ""whatever topic"" + blockchain as if it was so trivial.

I've participated in meetings with different vendors that come to our firm with ""the right"" platform and tools and expose the benefits of working with them as if they were the best option we could have. I've been into this blockchain environment for the last 2 years and I could follow, understand and make challenging questions to those vendors whereas managing directors in the room seemed surprised and so excited about what they were hearing from the them.

My points which I would like to hear your opionion on are....

1- I think these vendors want to take advantage of the low level of knowledge our MDs have, so they see a great opportunity to position themselves and start tens of projects with us.

2- I think what these vendors do is basically implement the open source code available in the communities and implement Fabric (and other Blockchain platforms), which could be done by ourselves by hiring or reskilling some of our developers.

3- The company I work for is not looking to create collaborative networks but pieces of patented software that can be re-sold to all possible clients to make $$$ (I am not aligned at all with this vision) They prefer having pieces of software to sell to all clients instead of working collaborativelly on a joint platform that could benefit all actors of an economy.

4- Being Hyperledger an opensource community, companies with the knowledge of implementing hyperledger (and other blockchain) platforms and offer this service to consulting companies (which are exposed to more clients) are the ones who are making money from this. So basically the pie ($) is in the implementation of blokchains.

5- You may be wondering if the company I work for is so big, why aren't they building blockchain projects with their own developers? well, they do. The thing is that blockchain is evolving continuously and in a pace that has not allowed the organization to organize and structure people working on blockchain initiatives and we find every week some folks from Bangalore that are working on a blockchain PoC that is overlaping with the work being done with other folks in San Francisco, and meanwhile the guys from Strategy instead of looking internally are hiring external vendors to build blockchain PoC for their clients...

6- Another thing that is confusing our clients is that when we explain ""blockchain"" in workshops we expose the benefits of a real blockchain (permissionless) such as decentralization, low hardware and energy costs (supported by the miners), etc. but what we are selling is centralized blockhains with expensive hardware and energy costs which is even more confusing for them. I think the community should find an alternative name to permissioned blockchains because this is leading to confusion when only explaining blockchain (permissionless) benefits.

7- With all this mess within the organization, I'm burning because my superiors ask me for ideas / to develop blockchain material but I don't share at all the vision of the blockchain leads so anything that I would be willing to share with them wouldn't be aligned with their objectives and I don't want to lose my time thinking on solutions for people who doesn't want to implement really blockchains but fake blockchains.

Thank you if you have read untill here and I apologie for the mistakes in the text as English is not my first language. I just would like to hear your thoughts on what you feel you can give me some clarification.

Thanks!",1533209137,02/08/2018 11:25:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93yfto/some_concerns_that_dont_let_me_sleep_well_please/,2

Definition of Bitcoin | Bitcoin news update," Bitcoin is known as the first scattered **digital currency**. They are basically coins that can be sent over the Internet. 2009 was the year  when Bitcoin was born. The creator’s name is unknown, but the alias **Satoshi Nakamoto** is given to this person.  

**The advantages of Bitcoin**

Bitcoin transactions go directly from person to person through the Internet. No bank or clearinghouse is required to act as a middleman. Because of this, transaction costs are much lower and they can be used in all countries around the world. Bitcoin accounts cannot be frozen and the prerequisites for opening them do not exist, the same restrictions. [**Bitcoin news updates**](https://www.cointiko.com/bitcoin-news/reason-behind-bitcoin-success-and-its-popularity/) every day more businessmen begin to accept them.

Energy inputs will always be the limiting factor.,"In order to provide the economic incentive to mine (and thereby secure the network) the formula Hash(x) = Reward(x) or some variation must hold true.

Increasing hash rates for miners will naturally require increasing energy inputs,  although advances in available technology can somewhat temporarily mediate those increases. But at whatever technological stage of equipment development available, the formula Hash(x) = Reward(x) holds true, as will the obvious corollary that Hash(x) = EnergyInput(x), with minor variations due to the economies of scale. Doubling your hash rate will generally require doubling your energy consumption unless moving to a more advanced technology.

There is no limit on the amount of hash a network can maintain. Although there is a numerical limit on the amount of reward available, this limit is an illusion. While the number of coins obtained may be finite, the potential value of each coin is not.

Only the Energy inputs remain to constrain mining. They will always be the limiting factor as the current state of our technology does not provide for unlimited energy. One day we may see families make financial choices based upon whether their energy consumption should be used for entertainment or for crypto mining, similar to the way they ration their dollar consumption today.

Do you remain anonymous when buying bitcoin with credit cards?,"I know very little about crypto currencies

My understanding is that since it is decentralized, anyone can trace a transaction from Wallet A to Wallet B. What keeps it anonymous is that no one knows to whom wallets A and B belong (or at least they shouldn't). Right?

But if I buy Bitcoin with credit card from some exchange, they would need to deposit that bitcoin into Wallet C. At the same time, there will be credit card transaction receipt for the same amount. So, at the very least, the exchange would know that Wallet C was funded from my credit card, and therefore belongs to me. And from that point, anyone could trace bitcoin purchases back to this wallet, right?

A tale of merchant adoption... with a twist,"**Background:**

So in December 2013 I became enamored with Bitcoin and immediately  wanted to implement the ability to pay with it in my online business.  
 

Using a payment provider made the most sense for me and the options at  the time were Bitpay and Coinbase. Coinbase had a deal for 0.5% for the  first $1MM in revenue so I jumped on that. I believe in Bitcoin, so I  set it to hold the coins rather than convert to fiat.  
 

I'm a coder so integration was pretty smooth. It probably took about 4  hours of actual work, mostly running test transactions and waiting for  confirmations.  
 

**Result:**

Well I expected adoption to be slow, and figured the intersection of  Bitcoin users and my customers would be small to boot. Indeed it has  been. Since December 2013 I've had 12 orders paid with Bitcoin for a  total of just over half a bitcoin. Most came in before 2017.  
 

I recall looking occasionally at the order history and thinking ""well, I  did a good thing even if I'm not getting a ton of orders. Maybe one day  it'll pay for the time I took in implementing it"". No big deal, fun  project.  
 

A month or so ago it occurred to me to check again and while I've had no  more orders, that half a bitcoin is worth a nice chunk of change...  MUCH more than the time I put into it. In addition, when BCH forked I  ended up with a bit of that as well. OVERALL WIN!  
 

**Present Day:**

I'm still a fan of Bitcoin and since Coinbase dumped their merchant  integration I just implemented Coinpayments. Integration went pretty  smoothly there too. Their API is pretty full featured, though  transactions can be a little slow to register with them, making the  status screen a little less useful. Check it out and feel free to buy my  product, called Copy2Contact, at [www.copy2contact.com](http://www.copy2contact.com).

Bitcoin UBS report,"On a standalone basis, using Bloomberg price data indicates that bitcoin's average annual return since the start of 2013 has been 216%. Comparatively, US stocks and IG bonds have risen on average 16% and 1.6% annually, respectively (the latter suffered from both taper tantrum and the more recent rise in US rates). Over this period, bitcoin has outperformed bonds by a big margin on a risk-adjusted basis, but only very modestly beat stocks. We use monthly returns and standard deviations to calculate the annualised Sharpe ratio for the three assets. We assume the risk-free rate is zero for ease of computation, and given that US T-bill yields were close to zero for the majority of that period. Bitcoin's standalone Sharpe ratio is 1.25, against 1.17 for the S&amp;P 500 and 0.49 for US IG bonds. These findings are unsurprising given the unprecedented rise in the price of bitcoin.

We looked at how a typical portfolio would have behaved with and without bitcoin. As an illustrative exercise, we constructed two portfolios: 1) a US-centric 60% equity, 40% IG bonds; and 2) a more global version that includes 40% MSCI World, 20% MSCI EM, 15% US IG, 7.5% EM dollar bonds, 7.5% EM Local, 5% US HY and 5% gold. We then constructed two identical portfolios, with the exception of adding a 5% allocation of bitcoin, and reducing the weights of the other assets in proportion to their original weight. We used total returns and rebalanced our portfolio monthly.

Our results are interesting (Figures 13 &amp; 14). First, the clear implication is that adding a 5% allocation of bitcoin to our sample portfolios would have increased returns considerably, by 11pp annually, roughly doubling the overall return for the US portfolio and tripling that for the global portfolio. Second, the standard deviation of the portfolios would have risen substantially too, doubling in both cases. However, this was not enough to deter an improvement in the overall Sharpe ratio for the portfolios after bitcoin was added, albeit small in the case of the US portfolio. This makes sense given that the standalone Sharpe ratio for bitcoin was higher than both portfolios before inclusion, so even if there were no diversification benefits whatsoever, the inclusion of bitcoin would have increased the ratio.

However, historically there have been meaningful diversification properties. Bitcoin's correlation with other asset classes has been, according to our analysis, close to negligible (Figure 15). This was also seen in the maximum drawdown calculation for the portfolios, which barely changed despite adding a highly volatile component. Therefore, adding bitcoin to a typical portfolio would have had a favourable impact on both absolute and risk-adjusted returns for the period considered.

But there are also natural limitations, which could restrict the connection between the past and the future. The current market capitalisation of bitcoin is roughly $130bn (down from as much as $325bn in December 2017). As a purely illustrative exercise, if bitcoin prices were to increase at a similar pace as they have done since 2013, this would imply a valuation of $7.8trn by 2021, without accounting for the increase in supply which would result in an even larger valuation. Not only does this dwarf the market capitalisation of the world's most valuable company, Apple Inc, by almost 10 times, but it is also roughly five times the total volume of US money in circulation.

\*There is no certainty on whether bitcoin's 2013-18 performance is likely to be repeated; the potential portfolio benefits implied by our calculations are purely illustrative",1533234318,02/08/2018 18:25:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/941tzc/bitcoin_ubs_report/,1

"The top cryptocurrency by exchange volume is Bitcoin, with roughly $4.5Bn traded daily (and over $10 Bn if you include derivative markets). Position number 2 is held by Tether, which is a token that exists on the bitcoin blockchain through the OMNI layer.","For all they hype that utility tokens, turing complete chains and stable coins get when people talk about altcoins, not only does bitcoin still command the majority of the exchange volume and the majority of the value, but its blockchain is also the one relied upon to operate the largest token - Tether.  For those who don't know, Tether is an OMNI token, and Omni itself is a platform that runs tokens using OP\_Return transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. (OMNI was originally known as MasterCoin).  

Together, the daily volume of Tether and Bitcoin are typically greater than that of all other coins and tokens combined.  

When it comes to what is relied upon as a store of value and as a secure platform on which to host tokens, there is nothing that compares in terms of real world use to Bitcoin.

Bitpanda refuses to delete my account,"Hello  


I contacted BitPanda and asked them to remove my account and my personal information. They took a few days to respond, as expected, and then said they could not delete my account until after 3 years because of ""defence of legal claims"" which is one of the exceptions to a deletion request as stated in the GDPR. [https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/) \- see section 3.e.  


I said that they cannot just refuse to delete an account without explaining the reason for such a decision, and explained that my account has had no activity at all (I never used it) and for this reason could not possibly be relevant in any legal dispute or claim. They did not answer. I waited a few days and then said I would escalate the issue with the Austrian data protection authority if they could not elaborate or present reasonable justification for their decision, and to do this I would require a copy of all information they currently retain on me - another of my rights under the GDPR. 30 days have almost passed since my data subject access requests, as they call it, and BitPanda has still not responded to any of my requests after they said they would not delete my account.  


Is this normal practice? I run a SaaS myself and I always just delete users' information whenever they request that I do so.  If any company can just go out and cite section 3.e without elaboration, then what's the point of the right to be forgotten? I don't understand why they don't just comply with my request. Can anyone perhaps enlighten me?",1533236351,02/08/2018 18:59:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9424qg/bitpanda_refuses_to_delete_my_account/,1

Just saw this on Facebook.. thoughts?,"OKEx liquidation and ETH/USD Bitmex:rotating\_light:An important situation is unfolding at OKEx, one of the top crypto exchanges in terms of daily volume. The number one contract holder at OKEx had accumulated a $460 million long position before he was liquidated :chart\_with\_downwards\_trend:on July 31st. While this is astonishing in its own right being such a massive position to be liquidated, the main issue with the current situation is that that the liquidation did not get filled in the market. There is now a $420 million overhang waiting to be filled just above $8000. OKEx will be coming out with their decision on how to handle the recent liquidation at 4:00pm Hong Kong time tomorrow.

Currently OKEx has 10 btc in their insurance fund, which is used to reconcile situations like the current one. Unfortunately the liquidation has resulted in a 950 btc loss. Since their insurance fund clearly doesn’t cover the loss, OKEx will have to make a decision on how to reconcile the liquidation sitting on their books.If BTC’s price can’t climb back above 8k to fill the liquidations, then the massive wall will have to be dealt with by using a clawback. A clawback would entail that shorters have to use their profits to pay for the liquidation. This likely outcomes that will occur if a clawback takes place are: OKEx users will become extremely disgruntled :sleepy:and move to different trading platforms and shorters will close their positions as they do not want to be held responsible for the payback procedure.This is yet another interesting development in the crypto space. 

We are not sure as of this point what effect it will have on the market if any but will be awaiting announcement from the OKEx [team.In](https://team.In) other news, Bitmex, the leading daily $BTC volume exchange, will now be offer ETHUSD 50x swaps and ETH/BTC 50x future trading options. This offering will be the first altcoin that the Bitmex platform enables you to use USD as a trading pair. Bitmex has quickly become one of the best trading platforms in the space especially during this ongoing bear market and it looks to stay that way.We will keep you posted on the OKEx developments.

I made an Updating Bitcoin Price Website,"Hi r/Bitcoin,

My name is Mike and I am a MIS major going into my sophomore year in college. This summer I have tried to increase my programming knowledge and skills as well as grow my portfolio with coding projects for my future career and internships during and post college. I decided to create an updating cryptocurrency website that shows a few pieces of information for Bitcoin(price, market cap, 24 change and volume) a few weeks ago. This is my first project after learning html, css and javascript. 

Link: [http://coinlive.me](http://coinlive.me)

I added the real time information and a logo effect so the website can be just left on a computer screen to display the updating price data.  I know that the site could definitely use more work but honestly I am pretty proud of how it turned out so far. Some of the current problems are that the website is not very mobile friendly, some of the elements overlap and the logo animation effect does not work with a finger touch on mobile either. This is unfortunate but I am aware of these problems and am still trying my best to make it better as much as I can!

Some future ideas I have are to add more cryptocurrencies and add more data and potentially graphs. 

I am very open to constructive criticism of what I should change and what I can make better. 

Thanks for reading and checking out my site! I hope this can be of use to someone!

Bitcoin dominance going above 60% - BTC ETF will be announced in 2018 &gt;&gt; OPINION &lt;&lt;,"- Bitcoin dominance is currently at 48.5% (August 2, 2018).
- Dominance will go above 60% or even 65% by the time the Bitcoin ETF is launched.

- Bitcoin ETF will be announced in 2018 (maybe VanEck &amp; SolidX ETF in August or September).
- Bitcoin ETF will be launched late 2018 or early 2019.
- Bitcoin ETF will come before Ethereum Futures.


- When SEC accepts ETF, the herd’s money will flow into BTC first (Altcoin season to start after).
- If SEC refuses VanEck, SolidX ETF, BTC will go down but Altcoins will suffer more.
- Bitcoin ETF will be more significant for price than the Bitcoin Futures.


- Before Altcoin season starts, expect rapid increase in BTC dominance similar to Dec 5 to 7, 2017 (55% to 66%).
- Altcoin season might start just before Bitcoin ETF is actually launched. (That’s what happened for Bitcoin Futures - Dec 7, 2017).
- Dec 7, 2017 to Jan 10, 2018 was the crazy Altcoin bull season. BTC dominance went from 66% to 33%.


- CBOE Bitcoin Futures were announced August 2, 2017.
- CME Bitcoin Futures were announced October 31, 2017.
- CBOE Futures launched Dec 10, 2017.
- CME Futures launched Dec 17, 2017.


- Bitcoin highest dominance in last year = 67% on Dec 7, 2017.
- Bitcoin highest value = 20,035 USD on Dec 17, 2017.
- Public learned about VanEck &amp; SolidX ETF filing on June 6, 2018.

**- See dates on BTC dominance chart = https://ibb.co/bPvkBK**


These are just my opinions and not financial advice! Duh!

What’s your opinion? How high will the Bitcoin dominance go?

Could the gov create their own cryptocurrency?,"I love bitcoin and alt coins, the whole 9 yards. But i have been seeing companies like IBM mentioning that they are looking into cryptocurrency for banking.

Got me thinking, cant the gov just create its own cryptocurrency?

Then they would just swap our usd and bank accounts for their ""coin / new money"". Ofcourse we can say no one would want that and they would still want bitcoin. 

But, i believe more people would want the new gov money. And i do not think you could invest in it like you can bitcoin.

Bitcoin is amazing and cool and all but it does not seem stable to be used as a daily currency for everyone. Having $1000 today and than $800 possibly tomorrow or $2000 tomorrow would seem to stop daily users from purchases.

Ofcourse bitcoin would not be accepted or used by the gov, they didnt create it (well were not sure). 

Hell, bitcoin and crypto could all be a beta program to see how it functions in the world before creating a new currency. 

I believe we could see a new world currency in the form of crypto and blockchain. You cant print fake crypto like cash. And big brother would love if everything was on blockchain. 

I am not on anyones side, i am just thinking i guess crazy conspiracys hehe.

Anyways, thoughts?

Bitcoin reminds me of two olds sayings.,"What goes up must come down.

The bigger they are the harder they fall.

I can already foresee the comments about how wrong i am because ""alts are falling harder than btc"" But what you need to understand is that btc losing 10 percent of its value is 12.6 billion as of this writing. Which would wipe 12.6 billion off the market cap of cryptocurrencies as a whole. 12.6 billion is worth more than almost any other single cryptocurrency. Aside from the top 4( including btc). We have been in a bear market since last december. ""but we had a bullish week silly"". No, no we did not. A short squeeze at best. Or just more pump and dump by the whales.  We are in a long term bear market and its probably not even half over. Hodl all you want but from the end of last year we would have all been better off putting our value on a stable coin and buying back in when/if this bear market ever ends.

Why is the price of BTC so comparatively high?,"Why is the price of BTC so high compared to other fiat currencies? Like, the price of one bitcoin is massively higher-priced than one dollar. If the value of the Canadian dollar was 3 USD, this would probably have catastrophic consequences for the Canadian economy, and yet bitcoin is worth *thousands* of dollars per bitcoin, and no one blinks an eye.

And what seems even crazier to me is that if bitcoin isn’t trading at 10k or higher, people think this is a huge fail, but isn’t it amazing that it’s valued at thousands of USD per bitcoin in the first place?

BOT: Monitoring of new coins,"There are a lot of crypto exchanges currently - Binance, Bitfinex, Poloniex, HitBTC and many others. And often when a new coin is being added to the new exchange, it causes a huge growth in this coin's price.  


That's why we've launched a Telegram bot to keep you notified when a new coin just started trading or will start trading soon.  


Bot link - [**https://t.me/CryptoHoundBot**](https://t.me/CryptoHoundBot)  


The idea is simple: the bot scans API's of the main exchanges every minute and sends updates to the user as soon as sees a new coint or a pair. Often developers add a pair on API first and only then on the website.  


Currently we support 25 exchanges + Coinmarketcap's ""Newly added"" page:  


1 (Most important ones, emoji - 🔥): Binance, Bittrex, Kucoin, Bitfinex, Bibox, Poloniex, Kraken, HitBTC, Bitstamp, Gemini, Gdax, Bit-Z, Liqui, Okex, Huobi

500M Global Rideshare users by 2021,"A Refined Approach to Ridesharing for the Blockchain Generation.
Focused on unlocking the potential of Africa and emerging cities around the world with a million population or more.

While existing traditional services treat drivers poorly and rely on their low incomes to boost their business, Vite is circumventing this by offering a model that is mutually beneficial for riders, drivers, and cities involved. Unlike the huge cuts charged by competition, slicing up to a quarter of driver income, Vite drivers keep what they earn, with the catch that 5-10% of their income goes into Vite Impact Fund (VIF), maintaining a technological infrastructure of the service and funding social causes. We believe that great organizations have to be driven by purpose in order to create a healthy profit model.

On top of that, Vitecoin will remove the hassle of carrying cash, credit card and become the leading digital currency settlement layer between riders and drivers.",1533283326,03/08/2018 08:02:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/947ptw/500m_global_rideshare_users_by_2021/,1

**David Graeber** i*s a british anthropologist (intellectully anarchist) arguing that history of money isn't that of barter, but originates in systems of debt. Money (mint), according to his surprising ,and revolutionary (but very obvious and logical-) theory, arise out of the expansion of violent empires, tribute, loot, enslavement.*

&gt;""*we are currently living in the early years of a new era in which  physical money - cash passing from hand to hand - will be replaced by  virtual money. There have been many eras of virtual money over the past  5000 years ..*  
&gt;  
&gt;... *capitalism's existence as an economic  system has been entirely within one oscillation back and forth between physical and virtual money. There is every reason to believe that, if we  are indeed heading towards a long period of virtual money, the predominant economic system in this period might also be something different (..than debt).""*",1533295090,03/08/2018 11:18:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/948pwx/bitcoin_readers_digest_david_graebers_5000_years/,1

Please don't tell me you traded you alt coins for bitcoin...,"After months and months , practically 8 months of being in the red, you finally see bitcoin going up but the altcoins dumping. There being absolutely no reason when btc bottomed out to jump up 20-30% BEFORE news of the ETF being passed or not, would of probably been your biggest mistake and here is why.

Currently altcoins follow bitcoin, so when bitcoin is going up people could be selling their alts for bitcoin and the price of bitcoin could just keep going up while alts bleed, because people are market selling for bitcoin trying to catch the bus, Well say after bitcoin reaches a certain point and stabilizes and the big whales start selling off, the WHOLE market goes down durastically, in these times where bitcoin is going up for no reason you should not keep trying to catch the bus, if your in it for the long run just keep your alts and don't look at them, get ready to set up the altcoins nodes, or wait for product releases you will make way more gains after this market breaks from bitcoin. That is saying coinbase ever gets their head out of their ass and adds more coins, or hopefully a way better competitor shows up.

All being said everyone sold alts trying to catch the bitcoin pump, and whoever or whatever group pushed bitcoins price up then begin to sell now the alts have way lower lows then before and bitcoin has been a falling knife the past 2 days, I predict we might see maybe some bullish moves going into august 16th, but if the ETF gets dissaproved and you sold your good legitimate alt coins your going to be sadly dissapointed how fast bitcoin is going to crash and how much of your altcoins bag you would of lost.",1533298689,03/08/2018 12:18:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9493b0/please_dont_tell_me_you_traded_you_alt_coins_for/,1

One of the SEC Commisioner supports Bitcoin ETF problem is there are 5 panels and she is only one. Hope she can persuade the other the importance of the approval of this.,"I think Bitcoin ETF sits on a 50/50 chance to be approved yet but there's still a glimpse of light shining as one of the Commissioner Hester Peirce in favor of it,  in a sense that she likes to open on US an nnovation approach that could contribute to greater development. 

The new member of the commissioner dissent the decision of rejection of Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF with a 3 to 1 vote, stating that the rejection isnt fair and over jurisdiction since they only looked on the possible outcome that price will be manipulated. 

Quoted from Her interviewed “I think we have an important role to play telling the United States and the world that our capital markets are open to innovation,” said Peirce. “And that’s what sort of drove my dissent last week and what really drove me to come back to the agency as a commissioner. ”

There's no timeline when the voting will commence and not sure if its on the middle of 2018 maybe early 2019.

I have always gone there by just typing ""Crypto Market"" into the address bar on Google Chrome. I don't bother book marking it because I can typically type faster and use keyboard shortcuts faster than switching over to the mouse and clicking a short cut. 

Obviously Chrome learns the things you go to often and you only have to enter the first few letters of commonly visited sites for it to auto populate.

"NYSE, Starbucks, and crypto?","Well, what news from the old money's world.

NYSE announces a project with Microsoft and Starbucks to create a digital asset ecosystem: [https://www.businessinsider.com/the-owner-of-the-new-york-stock-exchange-is-teaming-up-with-microsoft-and-starbucks-to-build-an-ecosystem-for-crypto-2018-8](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-owner-of-the-new-york-stock-exchange-is-teaming-up-with-microsoft-and-starbucks-to-build-an-ecosystem-for-crypto-2018-8)

Such a ground for puns, you know.

But seriously, I do not get why is everyone being so enthusiastic about it. Crypto, Microsoft, and Starbucks all in the same boat — it seems at least strange. Being dramatic I would say that's ideologically incorrect. Look, a year ago Morgan Stanley called Bitcoin a bubble and now they hire crypto expert Andrew Peel as head of the digital assets markets. On the one hand, the recognition of value is pleasant even if it comes for last, but on the other, it completely deprives the very idea of cryptocurrency and brings it under control of the corporation, large banks, and governments.

Yes, this is a big step for the old money, but is it for the cryptocurrency and, most importantly, where?",1533317782,03/08/2018 17:36:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94bnko/nyse_starbucks_and_crypto/,1

Centralised solutions are the key to mass adoption of Bitcoin.,"Hard core Botcoiners will hate me saying this, but we need to accept that centralised solutions are the key to mass adoption. What you value most about Bitcoin, like censorship resistance, and sovereignty, absolutely do not matter to the vast majority of people, especially those looking to just buy a cup of coffee. The first big exchange to branch out into payment provision via a companion centralised wallet will dominate the world. At the backend they can link to LN and sidechains from their exchange balance to settle balances with other large payment providers. Not only would this give us better privacy, but the UX would be exactly what the customer wants. 

Further I will predict that in 10 years, almost all new users to Bitcoin will never even interact with the chain directly, even though theuncan if they want. ",1533319359,03/08/2018 18:02:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94bw0y/centralised_solutions_are_the_key_to_mass/,1

Kambria future robotic economy,"According to a recent research study, the robotics economy is projected to see an explosive growth, increasing from a total market value of 40 Billion USD in 2016 to a potential market valuation of 135 Billion USD in 2019. According to the market statistics, the robotics market has some great prospects in terms of compounded annual growth in the coming years.


The term Robotics was first introduced by I, Robot (1950) science fiction author, Isaac Asimov. Robotics is the branch of technology that handles the design, operation, construction and application of robots. In the book Mr. Asimov described the three laws of Robotics:
 ➡️ A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
 ➡️ A robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
 ➡️ A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

The Articficial Intelligence (AI) and robotics economy consists of various branches ranging from human-friendly companion robots that accompany elderly citizens to fully autonomous vehicles and anything in between. One of the projects that aims to disrupt the robotics industry by making the development process faster, cheaper and easier is Kambria.",1533320817,03/08/2018 18:26:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94c3mz/kambria_future_robotic_economy/,1

 Bitcoin being accepted by a major brick and mortar business is one of the best things that has recently happened for it, a chance for Bitcoin to be seen in the physical world. Bitcoin could well make it's way to standing beside Applepay and all the other major payment services. This is a chance for Bitcoin to gain exposure to a whole new group of people that would not have heard of it otherwise.

Bitcoin Core Software Commit Access - Potential Human Vulnerability Questions,"I've been searching for a discussion on this topic but haven't found anything. I have some questions regarding the potential for an attacker to obtain a developer's commit access to the Bitcoin software. I'm not a software developer so I may not understand the way that the process works. Be gentle...

So my theoretical scenario is as follows. As Bitcoin grows and becomes a significant financial force in the world it becomes a high value target for a terrorist organization that wants to disrupt the financial system. Said organization waits until a release of a new version of Bitcoin is imminent. They compromise a core developer, obtain commit access and insert malicious code just prior to the release of the new software. The software is put in production by nodes, miners etc. and has a significant negative effect on the network or stops it from functioning altogether. While I'm sure that there are people out there that test the newly released software in isolation prior to putting it in production one would also think that there are people that simply upgrade and run it without looking at it or testing it.

Is this not a likely scenario because more than one developer with commit access has to authorize a final software release and would notice the malicious code? 

If not is this a potential problem?

If it isn't a potential problem why not? 

If it is a potential problem is there something being discussed that would make it unlikely or impossible?",1533365049,04/08/2018 06:44:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94h7ql/bitcoin_core_software_commit_access_potential/,1

Bitcoin has no competition," All those FUDsters that where saying year ago how Bitcoin would fail because another currency would take over get proven wrong year after year. The more time Bticoin is alive, the stronger it gets and the bigger the network effect. Sorry but there will not be a Bitcoin 2.0. Bitcoin will go to 100k+ per coin in the next 5 to 10 years, it will absorb all the value researched in the field if not directly through protocol improvements then through sidechains.  


Bitcoin will remain the only solid coin. The only coin that survived for the longest time (other coins can't claim this unless they invent a time machine).  
There will be alts that pump really hard and make people millionaires, but no alt is going to surpass Bitcoin's strength and solidity. No coin will get a bigger marketcap. In the long term people holding 21+ BTC will be rewarded by history with rich-tier status for seeing the value in it before most people did. Do not let the FUDsters trick your mind or the trolls try to derrail the excellent job being done by Core devs.

"There's a million bitcoin podcasts but which ones are actually worth listening to? I'll point out the ones that I've looked into, but I'm wondering if there's some I've missed.","I'm not particularly interested in podcasts that are petty or spend a lot of effort in creating conspiracies. I'm moderately interested in the politics as long as they are being somewhat secular and non tribal. I'm also interested in podcasts where they delve into technical stuff and are pretty knowledgeable. I have a huge affinity for irreverence. I loved bitcoin uncensored in the past because they just didn't give a fuck and they mocked everything, while at the same time had a pretty deep understanding of how the technology works. They also weren't afraid to say something that didn't tow the line and weren't afraid to be controversial.

I'll give a few examples of podcasts that I'm listening to and ones that I'm avoiding currently.

Junseth's World: The show is quite entertaining, though some I don't really care as much for the generalized politics that they talk about. That said the hosts are entertaining, they generally know what they are talking about and they discuss the stuff that I find interesting for the most part. The stuff they go deep on is stuff that is generally true and they talk about things that I don't see talked about in other places. For example the fallacy of more energy efficient mining. The implications of having mining come to your area. The generalized economics that they discuss is all very interesting.

Derose uncensored: I'm generally a fan of chris's position of being a secular bitcoiner, but he's gone off the rails a bit since BU fell apart. It's ironic because he used to really hate going into areas that he called a ""science free zone"". Now he spends almost all of his time there and the sheer volume of farts in his content is absolutely noxious. He spends a lot of time talking to people who have just entered the space and who aren't even worth listening to. It also seems quite clear to me that he goes into these discussions trying to manipulate the discussion and trying to push a position rather than trying to learn anything. I'll only listen/watch his content if there's a very specific topic or a very specific person on that I find interesting. It's not that great.

Noded: They go off a bit into the tribalist nonsense that I don't find very interesting or productive but they are entertaining and have highly technical people on their podcast all the time and they discuss the things that I find interesting. On the whole this show is great.

Tone Vays: I almost didn't want to bring this guy up just because he is such a fucking moron. He has no idea what he is talking about. He's an astrologer at his core spreading absolute bullshit about reading his tea leaves. It is absolute bottom feeder content that appeals to newbies and naive people. He also is VERY non-technical and makes it very obvious to anyone who knows anything about the space that he has no idea what he is talking about technically. He says things that are absolutely wrong constantly and when he talks to people with opposing views he almost always loses because of how unknowledgeable he is. He makes a lot of appeal to authority. He makes a lot of circular arguments. This guys content is the absolute worst.

WCN/Bitcoin group: This is usually just a panel of people who have no idea what they are talking about and is generally uninsteresting. They also aren't very funny or entertaining.

Blocktime with Michael Tidwell, Paul Sztorc, Michael B Casey and I forget the last guy: Back when they were making podcasts they were great. It's really unfortunate they stopped making these. They all were pretty knowledgable and had a pretty good understanding of how bitcoin worked. It was funny and insightful but for whatever reason they stopped coming out.

Jimmy Song: He comes out with some long for content/podcasts from time to time that on the whole is pretty good. He's pretty technically knowledgeable and for the most part seems to avoid tribalistic fallacies and drana and argues things based on their merit from his perspective.

Shinobi/JW/Block Digest:These guys are as tribalistic and conspiratorial as they come. I find these guys very difficult to listen to because of this BUT they are generally technically knowledgable, they come out fairly consistently and they discuss the day to day goings on in the bitcoin ecosystem. They also from time to time have something insightful to say. I very begrudgingly listen to this podcast most of the time due to there not being anything better that comes out frequently and keeps me up on the week to week goings on in the space. I would enjoy their content much more if they would stop weaving fabulous unfounded conspiracies about other actors in the space. Extrapolating intentions of people, companies, and projects that make absolutely no sense if you even put a modest amount of thought into it. I mean why weave some magical conspiracy about someone's intention being evil or nefarious when it could very easily be described as just being naive or stupid. Not everyone is a fucking super villain. Not every project is a secret plan to try to destroy bitcoin or undermine the ecosystem.

Doug Polk: This guy is pretty entertaining. He is very non-technical, but isn't afraid to admit it. The people he has on his show can be pretty hit or miss. A lot of the time it's just one of his buddies he invites on the show who is even more clueless than doug is, and those shows can be real stinkers, but sometimes he has interesting people on and the discussion can be quite interesting.

Richard Heart:This guy is interesting. For what it's worth I think he's a total scammer and a bit of an asshole. He's proclaimed he is going to create atleast 2 scams and outright said he's doing it solely for the money, not to actually contribute to the ecosystem. He's also into a bit of the woo woo technical analysis bullshit. That said he's had some of the most epic and entertaining rants in the space. When he interviews people with his skepticism hat on he can be spot on and those shows are great.

Let's Talk Bitcoin: These shows on the whole are okay. Sometimes they discuss stuff that is interesting and sometimes they discuss stuff that is stupid. Andreas on the whole is great. Adam on the whole is okay. He is a bit naive. Stephany just seems like a token female to me. She doesn't seem to contribute much interesting to the discussion and doesn't seem to know too much about the technicals or even what is going on in the space. She seems generally uninterested in bitcoin. That's not to diminish her as a person as she is a smart person and has her expertise outside of the space. I've listened to a lot of her content over the years and she is quite knowledgable and has insightful things to say about a number of things, but bitcoin just doesn't seem to be one of those things. I think she's lost interest in the space as it's become more mainstream, and she's even said as such. They are also generally a bunch of fence sitters and wait for controversial or contentious things to be derisked before they take a position. Also they seem to record content in advance which can be quite obvious when they have a show come out like 2-3 weeks after an even has happened and they are talking about it. This stuff can be time sensitive and ephemeral and after a week or 2 all that can be said on a topic has already been said.

Andreas in general is great and everyone should watch his videos. He's quite technically savvy, appeals to a large audience and covers plenty of interesting topics.


That's all of the stuff that I'm aware of(unless I'm just forgetting something.). I'm always desperate for more though. I listen to podcasts all the time as I can listen to them at work and while I'm out and about so I can never have too many. Are there any people in the space or podcasts that I am missing?",1533383886,04/08/2018 11:58:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94im81/theres_a_million_bitcoin_podcasts_but_which_ones/,1

Accepting Payment Online via FIAT to BTC,"Hi all.  
I have an ecommerce website, that accepts payments in Euro/USD etc via payment gateway.   


I have read that its possible for websites to receive payments in USD or other currencies which will then be automatically converted into Bitcoin or other crypto and send to my wallet, does anyone know the name of this type of cryptocurrency payment terminal? 

So the purchaser will not need to have BTC, can still pay via debit/credit card, but this type of payment terminal will auto-convert to Crypto.

Does BitPay or Coinbase Commerce have similar functionality?

Trappt not Bakkd?,"Bakkt is a centralized third-party AML/KYC nightmare that if successful will gain custody of a huge number of bitcoins and their corresponding private keys. Those keys might not ever be relinquished. I am curious to know who and how Bakkt will be audited and how customer accounts will be balanced with the underlying BTC. Will retail investors be allowed to withdraw their bitcoins to their personal wallets?

To draw a parallel, central banks and bullion banks control a large percentage of the world's physical bullion with many of the individual underlying gold bars having paper claims on them by multiple owners. Many analysts argue that such centralization prevents true price discovery of the underlying assets to the benefit of the custodians and at the expense of the little guy. See [here for the gold story](https://goldiraguide.org/is-bitcoin-the-answer-to-the-gold-rehypothecation-problem/) and [here](https://www.caseyresearch.com/abcs-re-hypothecation-gold-and-securities-markets-what-you-need-know/)which explains how securities re-hypothecation brought down MF Global and their customers. 

Another analogy would be how the amount of money in retail bank customers' accounts is far greater than the amount of asset value held by the bank. This fractional reserve banking is what necessitated the trillions of dollars worth of QE bailouts by the Fed and other central banks when the real estate market collapsed in 2008.

These two paragraphs from the recent [Forbes article](http://fortune.com/longform/nyse-owner-bitcoin-exchange-startup/) sum up the issue nicely:

&gt;Sprecher’s plan for bringing crypto to the masses runs contrary to what Bitcoin supporters typically champion. The purists favor Bitcoin’s “distributed” architecture, and adamantly oppose putting a big exchange at the center of the both the Bitcoin investment and payments systems. “A regulated exchange with a custodian in the middle contradicts the basic idea of Bitcoin,” says Abhishek Punia, a crypto-currency analyst with venture capital firm Draper Associates. “Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, without intermediaries taking fees. A regulated exchange may be popular for a short period of time, but it’s not the future. The future will be the original idea of a peer-to-peer network.”

&gt;Sprecher and Loeffler (of Bakkt) disagree, arguing that a **strong central infrastructure is precisely what’s needed**, and that ICE and its partners are the ones to supply it. The challenge is getting the banks, asset managers, and endowments to embrace Bitcoin. “Being from the exchange world, we looked at the problem differently,” says Loeffler.

The bottom line is be vigilant. This Bakkt custodian is at best a solution to a temporary scaling problem and at worst a nefarious plot by powerful and established players to gain control over a lot of bitcoin wealth. If they are successful in gaining control it could set decentralized Bitcoin adoption back by years.",1533389616,04/08/2018 13:33:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94j5e5/trappt_not_bakkd/,1

I have a strange problem with my Bitcoin wallet that nobody else seems to have,"So I bought a lot of Bitcoin back in 2012 and 2013 and have cashed out a little but still have most of my balance on my wallet. I have 600 Bitcoins, but sometimes when I look from the corner of my eye, it seems to display 666 bitcoin. I don't know what causes this error and I think it's kind of stupid, as if someone is trying to play a trick on me. 

Another problem I run into is when I drive around im my lamborghini. Sometimes in the middle of the night I look in my rear view and see the pale face of a young boy sitting on my backseat. He seems to have blue lips, as if he is dying from a fentanyl overdose. Then I hear the sound of screaming parents, but I snap out of it and realize I almost drove my lambo into oncoming traffic. I think this is really annoying and it's probably caused by the fact that I lose sleep over my fear that my Bitcoin wallet was hacked. I even wake up in the middle of the night and imagine there's blood leaking from the ceiling of the bedroom in my new mansion, but then I squeeze my eyes and realize it's just the kind of hallucination you have when you wake up from your sleep. Anyway, what should I do, I tried reinstalling the wallet but it didn't help.

There are over 200 exchanges but less than 100 Electrum servers,"To be precise: 96 Electrum servers of which 21 over TOR.

The [site](https://uasf.saltylemon.org/electrum) that shows all Electrum servers hasn't even updated since April.


This is not good!

Electrum is a great wallet for many (starting) Bitcoin users but it needs servers to provide the balances (by providing the Merkle tree).

An Electrum wallet is a reasonably safe wallet, as described in the Bitcoin white paper:


**8 Simplified Payment Verification**

It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.",1533395177,04/08/2018 15:06:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94jrre/there_are_over_200_exchanges_but_less_than_100/,1

[https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/)

...with typical volume on decentralized exchanges like Bisq, EtherDelta.. or even Localbitcoins (which is P2P but not a DEX)...

[https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bisq/](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bisq/)

[https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/forkdelta/](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/forkdelta/)

[https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins](https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins)

It is astounding to see that volume on decentralized exchanges is still a tiny fraction of the total. After all it's not like we don't see centralized exchanges being hacked on a regular basis. Just this week it was OKEx, but almost every other week there's a hack, scam or theft that could be totally avoided by using a non-custodial decentralized exchange. 

Have we learnt nothing since the days of MtGox?

It's not only the counterparty risk... it's also censorship. In India and China P2P trading is still allowed but centralized exchanges have been shut down.

So I'd love to know why.

Why do ***you*** still use centralized exchanges? ",1533398462,04/08/2018 16:01:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94k5se/why_is_most_volume_still_on_centralized_exchanges/,1

Hyperdeflation?,"So I understand that this is what some people may have already coined 'Hyperbitcoinization', but I think it may make more sense to call it Hyperdeflation, since this is really what's happening.

We have accounts of Germany in the 1920s and Venezuelas current situation where their currency rapidly inflates to make it useless against other currency. My feeling is that as more and more people are driven to bitcoin by its improved properties over fiat, the value of the dollar will stay relatively what it's worth currently in order to purchase every day goods and services.

However, as bitcoin becomes more and more scarce, we will see millions and even tens to hundreds of millions per bitcoin.

I know at this point you probably think I'm crazy because that would put the market cap at 2.1 quadrillion. Market cap IMO is a meaningless metric for a currency. What is the market cap of the dollar? You have to have a relative value of something else to determine market cap. 

Since the market cap of bitcoin is meaningless, I think that Hyperdeflation of bitcoin against the dollar could play out in such a way where it becomes almost impossible to buy bitcoin in 5 or 10 years.",1533406607,04/08/2018 18:16:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94l70w/hyperdeflation/,1

From what I have been able to gather, the btc lightning nodes require some btc (i don't know why) so that  I can prove a transaction myself and in return i earn some small reward from a fee or something. 

Basically all i am asking is if I can open up a node on my computer using the Zap Desktop app or if I should stay away. Thank you and have a great day!",1533409424,04/08/2018 19:03:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94ljv4/small_question_with_lightning_nodes/,1

2 years to wait,"Good news is being ignored now in a bear market. The truth was also there the other way around back in December/January.

A nice bull market is being planted but yes you will have to be patient. By end of 2018/Start of 2019, we will have the start of the biggest bull market yet.

A 2020 global recession will push us further in a year that also includes the halving. This will be an event spoken about more and more starting in the summer of 2019. This is in a climate where there will be more instutional on ramps and overall wider access.

If you can wait two years, by September 2020 the price will be 50k+ It is then you know how it feels, if you don't already, to feel you earn those kind of returns as you will have been through these times. Those that held strong through the 2018 bear market will know they earnt it. Many will wish they bought in 'sub 10k Bitcoin as always happens with every bull run. We will have experienced the best before the best. 

Earn it and remember now in two years time you will enjoy it so much more aside from the obvious financial benefits.

What would happen...?,"If some great Bitcoin news faced off with some damaging Bitcoin news? I always pondered about that. Say a Bitcoin ETF was released on the same day as the Tether scam was exposed? What would happen? It’s yet to happen where both some great news and damaging news happen on the same day since that would be an extreme coincidence and Bitcoin has such an extensive history...and today one single in Bitcoin can seem like a lifetime. What would happen if a December 2008 recession met with news that major banks were suddenly buying Bitcoin? Obviously that sounds like a contradiction but would that spawn a heaven or hell scenario? I ask because we all know what happens when great news is announced vs bad news, but we don’t know what happens when both occurs on the same day. I predict that it would depend on many factors including (1) which news is greater (does the good outweigh bad), (2) are we in a bull or bear market? (3) what year it is and what is the current price of BTC? (4) most importantly, current regulation enacted to control Bitcoin volatility.

Any thoughts? I can’t find anything to compare it with events in the history of the stock market.",1533435497,05/08/2018 02:18:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94oj6r/what_would_happen/,1

Coinbase introducing custody service for other coins might be very good news for bitcoin,Shower thought.  At first I thought this news was a negative but now thinking that if big funds want to own bitcoin then it's likely that they would also allocate a share of the fund to the other coins as well.  With custodian services for only bitcoin this would not have been possible.  Now if they open up the service to those other coins it will allow big funds to move into bitcoin and keep a certain allocation to the other useless coins.

Can someone explain mining and trading in simple terms for a job interview?,"Like how mining exactly work, the thing with available coins and everything.

And then trading, which platform is the best right now, where are the most people, what are the terms Bull Market, Bear Market, what is the smart process.

Now why I need it - I am somewhat crypto knowledgeable (bought it before and earned some money hodling) but I have an interview for my job tomorrow and it requires basic crypto knowledge although I won't be working with it (and also I myself am interested in learning more). I imagine these are the things I definitely should know, also I am doing my own research.

BIG THANKS TO ANYONE WHO HELPS",1533451704,05/08/2018 06:48:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94q0y7/can_someone_explain_mining_and_trading_in_simple/,1
Some additional information if you're planning to run an Electrum server,"**FIRST OF ALL: YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR DATA DIRECTORY ON A SSD, A HDD IS TOO SLOW.**

You find information to run an Electrum server (called Electrumx) here: https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, but I think it's useful to have a look at the information here first:

&amp;nbsp;

My Electrumx data is in /media/electrumx/db_directoy

    ls -d /media/electrumx/db_directory/*

/media/electrumx/db_directory/COIN  

/media/electrumx/db_directory/meta/

/media/electrumx/db_directory/hist/ 

 /media/electrumx/db_directory/utxo/

and /media/electrumx points to my SSD

    df /media/electrumx/

/dev/sdb1       230G   69G  149G  32% /media/electrumx

&amp;nbsp;

**USE THE ELECTRUMX INSTALLER**

See: https://github.com/bauerj/electrumx-installer

Download the installer:

    git clone https://github.com/bauerj/electrumx-installer.git

Go into the installer directory: 

    cd electrumx-installer

I didn't use options when running install.sh, just changed the following directly in the intstall.sh script:

DB_DIR=""/media/electrumx/db_directory""

UPDATE_ONLY=0

USE_ROCKSDB=0

After that: 

    sudo ./install.sh

&amp;nbsp;

**RUNNING ELECTRUMX**

I start electrumx like this:

    sudo systemctl start electrumx

I stop electrumx like this:

    sudo systemctl stop electrumx


&amp;nbsp;

**Contents of /etc/systemd/system/electrumx.service**

[Unit]

Description=Electrumx

After=network.target

[Service]

EnvironmentFile=/etc/electrumx.conf

ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/electrumx_server.py

User=user

LimitNOFILE=26899

&amp;nbsp;

**Getinfo**

The electrum rpc is here:

    ls -ld /usr/local/bin/electrumx_rpc.py

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 189 okt 30  2017 /usr/local/bin/electrumx_rpc.py*

The command:

"My BitcoinTalk.org account has been hacked.. (11th july 2018), what now?","Hi,

My account on bitcoin talk forum, which I created back in 2012 was hacked / stolen 11th july 2018... (I just found about it today)... The account was using my other secondary email address on gmail which I didn't access recently because I was on vacation. 
I cannot login, I checked my inbox then noticed that on 11 july 2018 an email from bitcointalk informs me about the change of the associated BTCtalk email account to:

AvenG@protonmail.com by IP address 62.210.11.82. 

None of these are mine, not the email nor the IP. Unfortunately I wasn't able to undone that action because I was on a trip.
 
This is my Full Member account with 100 Merit +133 posts, registered on 19th September of 2012:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=67153
 
The russian hacker already managed to change some of my profile settings like location, signature, and added the quote ""Be Strong"", Also I remember having a BTC address: 1A6UzoDvPybimQg98B22yMoEF75wAZUdmt listed on that profile but not sure if it was linked properly or not (0 BTC &amp; 0 transactions). 
By the way, something positive is that no one is posting shit why my profile yet, also last time active is July 31, 2018. Maybe my account is listed / auctioned on a black market right now? 

I would appreciate anyone willing to help me recover my account. I already read other related posts on similar cases which states that only Cyrus and Theymos are able to restore the accounts, however this doesn't seem to be a priority to them if you can't prove ownership.. 
Typically, the only acceptable method of proving ownership is by signing a message (including current date and desired new email address) using a Bitcoin address or PGP key associated with the account. A Bitcoin address or PGP key is associated with the account only if the account posted the key/address, sent it in a PM, or if it is still listed in the account's profile.

https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=497545.0

As I stated before, the hacker already managed to edit my profile deleting the listed address that I liked there.. so not sure if it is gonna be valid signing a message with that address before sending the PM to the mods, I have several other that I used on my wallet back in the days.. some I used to sign messages privately with other users via PM (not publicly) not sure if this counts and if the hacker deleted those PM's as well.. I remember doing a trade with SebastianJu through.
    
Thanks in advance

iOS users BEWARE! The Binance app that shows first in search charges you 170$ automatically [details inside],"as soon as you open the app it prompts for an in app purchase, and if you have your finger on the fingerprint scanner, it will go through.  i didnt get tricked by it but i easily could see it happening and this is a glaring exploit in the in-app purchase system.  

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blnance-crypto-widget/id1405027191?mt=8&amp;app=itunes&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blnance-crypto-widget/id1405027191?mt=8&amp;app=itunes&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4)

Just because I'm bored and have resources available to me, if anyone manages to find a way to contact the developer, or finds his country of origin,  i would love to inform him of the evidence i have collected and my plan to go to his local authorities.  He faked a bunch of good reviews because all you can see is 1 star ones when you look. 

Over all watch out for any cryptocurrency application that requests permissions for any of your online accounts, especailly appleid, google account, microsoft account, dropbox, etc.  and if it wants you to make an api key on an exchange, run the other direction.  

i find joy in bringing scammers work up to their face and watching them squirm as they realize they're not so anonymous after all.  in most countries this legitimately would be an illegal theft by deception and i am going to try to attain prosecution against him or her.  

i recently helped provide info to get a bitcoin bandit using sim swapping arrested, you may have heard of joell recently.

we need to provide the entire case to the prosecution because they are typically lazy and dont understand shit but if everytihng they need lands in their lap then they are happy to be the hero.  took many fbi calls before i got in contact with someone who wouldnt write me off as any ole cryptolocker victim or related.

Responsible community assistence in unmasking and following the proper protocols is important in discouraging scumbags.  plus i get a hedonistic sense of satisfaction watching shitty people realize that they are going to face legal repercussions and have a pretty shitty first page google results for their name.  

p.s. Been scammed and have some info to begin working with (email, phone, name, ip, etc), i will provide my personal investigative services for free and report to the proper authorities.  i wont dox people for you and will give you censored info unless your situation meets a threshold of legitimacy (police report, some evidence of an attempt at recovery).  

\*\*HEY LY THAO, HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR SOME ATTENTION\*\*

\*ly thao is a public figure as he is representing the organization's public facing entity.  i am not doxing and do not intend to publish any further info that could be seen as doxing on this platform.

Swapngo security layer - looking for programer associated,"Hello to all i would like to ask you an opinion i have build swapngo.org is site where you post offers for sell and buy crypto for cash. The site has been up for 4 months or so. But nobody register i am aware the we still do not have ssl certificate and the i have not invested on publicity i am only using my social networks like Instagram and twitter basic things like that. So the dynamic is like this. You login and you post your offer for sell or buy and you put the amount of USD you want to receive from your crypto when you press buy or sell an email is sent to you confirming the transaction after that the offer goes to a global board where the rest of people can see it . Now at this point the other party go and check the board and find some offer that likes and type in the ID of that offer the system returns what i call the ---swapngo id card --- where is detailed some profile information  like country, the exchange methods the user have, and of course the email (plus some behavior information that i think would valuable since you can build your profile like in a game and nobody want a bad reputation).... so from that point on ... the interested part will contact the other user to make the deal  (transaction) by email and nothing else.  Now my question what would you suggest i could do to make it more secure?  I have thought in 3 things


1 Retain the coins that would be good but is only me doing all the code so that would be like lot of work plus right now the system handles like 10 or more different currencies. 



2 smart contracts not an expert on this but it could be a solution.



3 create a different dynamic that force users to not make scams.



BTW i am looking for coder associate that can make the site grow and be better if you would like to participate just contact me.

Thanks for any comment or suggestion you can give me.

I did use my segwit private key, then in the destination address I used my trezor adress wich is segwit as well. 

But the transaction did go to another address, not my segwit trezor address but one starting with 1.  This:    
1LysEDeDPngFDDNAkoJBe9aCmRZBgXyNX4 

This is the hash of the transaction:  

c09ec948f9750f8a3411717c7174194ffe09946ceb7b276d3f26d61e32abb0e0

I was holding that money because I was planning to leave Venezuela soon, a really shame but at least I would like to know what I did wrong, or if I was just scammed by the site.

How would I start a ad network,This isn't some trolling but a real question and that is simply how do I partner with ad companies and also make things work like how much money do I need? Or what do people here think the ad company server requirements are? Because I'm thinking someday about making a ad network that uses other networks then what it does is it takes the ads from normal ad companies for ads from companies like pizzahut and all that gets us paid in Fiat then converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for other people then pay then is it possible for me to do? I don't have a lot of money to invest for that I just wonder what people here think the starting cost is I probably might be able to do that someday I know code though I'm only one person but I'm sure I can make it happen and truth be told I wish a lot of ad networks pay in Bitcoin and aren't only Bitcoin based for the ads,1533535814,06/08/2018 06:10:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94ytra/how_would_i_start_a_ad_network/,1

Possible reason for BTC sell offs. Tin Foil Hat time.,"This is total tin foil hat ish however I think futures came online in Jan for a reason.  
It may not be a coincidence that the market crashed 4 weeks after BTC crashed.  
The last thing 'the centralized bankers' want is BTC to be a hedge for overprice equity and bond markets.

They knew they could not stop the BTC so what they did is bought enough coins 1500 to 3200 range to be able to then leverage their coins at key times to cool off BTC.  Remember derivative markets can and often do distort supply levels (at least in the short term)  It is 'akin to counterfeiting' as you are introducing coins into the market that would ordinarily not have been sold.  'Supply limits' is what makes BTC fundamentally stronger than any other asset on the planet, but if they can be counterfeited via derivatives? (perfectly legal for the immoral banker cabal - sigh)  

  
They knew in January that a major correction had to happen (which it did in February) So buy helping fuel the bull run in Nov/Dec they could accomplish two things;

1. They support the meme of  'bitcoin is too volatile to be useful' (ironically caused by then and their unbacked paper derivatives)
2. They dumped on leverage along side the mtGox trustee and used media to further panic people. (bubble bubble bubble bubble etc)
3. BTC then *did not 'look' like a good hedge* when it came to equity markets deflating a few weeks later.

I think they are doing it again and stocks and perhaps bonds will suffer a huge 'unexpected' correction again very soon (any day to next 6 weeks). So despite the good BTC fundamental news it will not come into the mind of most to use BTC as a hedge.  


For me , while this is total speculation, but I am shorting stocks (as of a Friday) and will long btc as the market tumbles.   


Ok now go ahead and beat me up since I have insulted the establishment and their dubious practices.  ",1533547395,06/08/2018 09:23:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/94zta2/possible_reason_for_btc_sell_offs_tin_foil_hat/,1

Beginner question,"Hi,

I apologize if this is inappropriate to ask but I really need help.
I sell digital adult content and got a BitCoin wallet with edge. A customer submitted a payment but I cannot see it yet. I know the transfer can take hours. He sent me a screenshot of the transaction, my address seems to be correct and is demanding the product since the transaction is irreversible.

Should I wait until payment is cleared on my wallet? Or is it really imposible to fake a transaction? I’ve seen contradictory information regarding this matter so I don’t know how to proceed.

Open Software store for 5 minutes and start Accepting Bitcoins today!,"![img](ww48kxzqkge11)

You have already your own online store, you make or sell softwares but you do not know how to unlock the true potential of your business? Maybe you can stop thinking like an ordinary businessman and start thinking like an IT expert that you should be! Blockchain is your playground now, and for many people in your community, bitcoin is already a money. 

So, take only five minutes of your time to start accepting Bitcoins.

![video](aw7n9jhskge11)

To do this, first at all, you must have a bitcoin wallet in order to receive your funds. Keep your bitcoin address carefully with you at all times! This will be your cash register. When created, log in to your WordPress admin panel and go to Plugins -&gt; Add New in the admin panel.  (1)

WordPress page [https://wordpress.org/](https://wordpress.org/)

WooCommerce Page: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)

![img](s831cubtkge11)

Then enter “Apirone” in the search box. A page will be loaded, contains all the details about Apirone. You can read it, but don't forget to click on the “Install now“ button.

Plugin page: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/apirone-bitcoin-forwarding/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/apirone-bitcoin-forwarding/)

Your plugin is ready, but you have to activate it. To this end, go to the WooCommerce section and choose the “Payments“ tab page. Turn “ON“ the Apirone's checkbox (2) and click on the “Manage“ button. (3)

![img](o4df4j4ukge11)

Now the last step! On this page, don't forget to check the status (4) before entering the destination your Bitcoin address. (5) 

You will receive only bitcoins with Apirone. But if you want to convert them all, you can indicate on the text field, during the step (5), the bitcoin destination address of any exchange trading account capable of that. Then, it will be easy to convert them.

The Greatest Repositories of Value and Retail Acceptance of Bitcoin,"Recently, there has been a great deal of attention/discussion regarding if Starbucks would begin to accept Bitcoin. While statements clarifying initial reports seem to indicate that won't happen anytime soon; there is no question the impact such an announcement would have had toward increasing adoption on a retail level due to Starbucks' massive footprint. Also, on more local levels it is always of interest to see businesses posted here from all over the world which have adopted using Bitcoin as a payment method, irregardless of their size or location.

Considering matters of retail use recently made me think which industries actually have the greatest amount of Bitcoin adoption? I found it interesting and somewhat ironic that Buillion Dealers have a very high incidence of adoption. This has seemed to fly under the radar with little discussion or notice. Many of the world's largest and best-Kitco, Apmex, JM, Provident, along with many others- all accept Bitcoin as a form of payment and some even offer a discount for buying gold, silver, or platinum with it.

While their acceptance and adoption is not a new development, I believe it is a noteworthy one worth discussion now. Prescious metals have provided a repository of value for thousands of years and are likely to continue to provide value long after the use of fiat. Likewise Bitcoin provides myriad economic opportunities into the future which the current fiat based financial system cannot facilitate. If an industry dealing with History's most time tested store of value largely recognizes the legitimacy of Bitcoin as a form of payment; others should and eventually will to.",1533558536,06/08/2018 12:28:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/950v0x/the_greatest_repositories_of_value_and_retail/,1

Block reward in the future and decreasing BTC security?,"current block reward is 12.50+0.1217 BTC (approx $87,733.91 USD) and over the coming decades the block reward will slowly move towards 0, with only fees incentivizing miners. Bitcoin enables on average 7 transactions per second, leading to 4200 transactions per every block. 

This means each user would need to pay a 20 USD fee in order to reach the 87k USD blockreward the miners get nowadays. 

Whats the solution to this issue by current bitcoin thinkers? As I havent read one so far. Lighting is nice for enabling a massive amount of low cost transactions, but this is enabled only by on chain security, which will get lower with decreasing block reward.

Both increasing the block size (to enable more on chain transactions per block) or adding a continuous indefinite inflation to bitcoin would solve this issue, but none of these are very likely to happen/would cause huge community infighting.

How will we solve this issue?",1533577453,06/08/2018 17:44:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/953f35/block_reward_in_the_future_and_decreasing_btc/,1

Thoughts / Concerns Regarding Wall St’s Entrance Into Bitcoin,"The more time that passes the more involvement / potential involvement that Wall St seems to have with Bitcoin.  To me it seems as though there has been a direct correlation to the price of bitcoin with Wall St’s entrance…. unfortunately that correlation appears to be in the negative direction in terms of BTC price.  Case in point would be the CME / CBOE futures which were launched right at the peak of the bitcoin bull market of last year.  Immediately upon launching these products bitcoin began its current decent from ~ 19.6K to nearly 5.8 K bouncing between about 5.8 and 10K a few times since.  Then of course there was the huge announcement most recently regarding ICE / NYSE and Starbucks, Microsoft etc. launching BAKKT.  Initially that sounded like the most amazing scenario to help reign in mass adoption that I (and probably most HODLers) could of imagined.  Then what happens? Yep the prices immediately drop about 10% in just a few days.  To me this seems absolutely opposite of what one might expect if you’re of the mindset that supply and demand determines value.  I next happened to stumble across an very well written article by Caitlin Long regarding the financialization of bitcoin (https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2018/07/31/is-financialization-a-double-edged-sword-for-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies/#25d546672a20 ) .  This article brought up several items that invoked concern about Wall St’s entrance into our cryptosphere.   Specifically with the idea of Wall St creating multiple unbacked paper claims via rehypothecation and leveraging to the same digital assets wherein there are multiple parties that have claim to the same asset.  My interpretation of her article was that in doing so that Wall St could potentially artificially reduce the scarcity aspect of protocol enforced amount of currency units of the bitcoin network as people would just buy the “Paper Bitcoin” that Wall St peddles and not the BTC itself. Now while I don’t exactly understand all of the technical details of this would be achieved, Caitlin mentions that Wall St could potentially “capture” bitcoin via these actions as they clearly cannot capture the bitcoin network itself. 
 
I’m certainly not a lawyer, financial adviser, or an economist but I can’t see how exactly Wall St. can do this.  I mean if people have paper claims to an asset that the organization which oversold them to their clients then that organization would be obligated to a) either produce the asset or b) seek bankruptcy protection.  I would think that if they were backed by such a large institution such as ICE then they would be concerned about their reputation and that if they ever overextended then they would simply seek out other bitcoins how we all do (exchanges).  Then, if anything I would think it would actually drive the price of bitcoin higher as most true HODLers will only every sell a small percentage of their BTC but never anywhere need most of it.  I should also mention that it was my interpretation Of Caitlyn’s article was that she felt this was a net positive for bitcoin due to the potential of having a qualified financial adviser bring in extremely large amounts of fiat into the bitcoin market. 
 
I guess my hope in writing this post is that the community can bounce some ideas around regarding how best to ensure that Wall St. cannot devalue our currency via “Paper Bitcoin”.  And also how to get the word out on educating the masses with respect to the economic and technical aspects to bitcoin and why we don’t need anyone to have BTC’s price increase over time as it was designed to do just that on its own.   Furthermore I would hope that we as a community can formulate a set of standards that we can put out there to demand from the Wall St firms when dealing with Crypto assets.  Perhaps something like each customer would be given their own bitcoin address when using BAKKT and other custodial services and that any time any assets leave their address they would be immediately notified.  This should eliminate the possibility of rehypothecation .  Additionally customers of any Wall St. firm dealing in Crypto should refuse to have their assets lumped together (comingled) into a general address as it would be almost impossible to track .  Feel free to share your thoughts on this subject.  I really believe that it’s important that we as a community address Wall St’s attempted manipulation of OUR currency. ",1533589657,06/08/2018 21:07:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9557r6/thoughts_concerns_regarding_wall_sts_entrance/,1

A good fact about bitcoin and napolean.,"A great quote from Napolean.  
""Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich.""  


How I think a Quote from Bitcoin would be.  
"" #print2win is what keeps workers from denying from INFINITE FRAUD RICH. ""  


  
So mine, and hodl, and don't settle for less then our creators namesake.  
Satoshi is the new system.  


He has built it, they will come.  But they will learn why do they still trust banks when banks can't even trust other banks...?  Think about that but the blockchain trusts itself perfectly for 10 years.    


So many people here are probally so afraid to go outside: and spend or even mine a bitcoin in public.   I've done this:  I set up a shitload of asics outside and mined a whole bitcoin in 2011.  People looked at me like I was stupid, god I wish I youtubed that years ago.  But I'm glad I didn't... i don't need people trying to kidnap my family or friends.  I'm glad I left those people behind too.  


Work together, and get rid of this false PAPER ENTITLEMENTS and get back to real ""VERIFIED RESOURCES that can't be TAMPERED with by any MIDDLEMAN or OUTSIDE PARTY.""  


Take back our actions:  You can't sue the blockchain.  That's the best part.   Can't blame people for your own loss or mistake spending of your own private keys.

"Send BTC by Private Key, Receive by Sweeping the Key","I’m curious why the use of sending BTC by the means of private keys couldn’t be made more streamlined as a way to send/give BTC to anyone even to those without a BTC wallet. The private keys would come from one time use wallets that are preloaded by the sender. The receiver could just hold the private keys or immediately sweep the BTC from the private key into their own BTC wallet.

Currently, sending BTC requires the recipient to have a BTC wallet setup which is somewhat similar to saying you need a physical wallet before you can own some dollar bills. It’d be nice to be able to send BTC to literally anyone even those without prior understanding of Bitcoin let alone a Bitcoin wallet. Lower the barrier to own Bitcoin. 

Obviously BTC wasn’t designed to transact by sending private keys but at the same time it could be an interesting method.

1. The verification of funds on a private key is instant (no waiting for blocks)

2. The private key string / QR-code is a store of BTC.

3. Anyone with (2) would be holding BTC without the need of a BTC wallet. 

What I originally imagined is a simple service where links with Bitcoins could be created and sent to anyone. Even printed out on a piece of paper. As long as the user keeps the information safe they would be owning and holding Bitcoin. 

To an extent this could be done/tested now with bitaddress.org (generating a wallet with public and private key). Sending BTC to the public wallet address and then sweeping the private key by scanning the private key QR-code with a Bitcoin wallet app. The process is far from streamline but pieces of the puzzle already exist. 

There are some drawbacks 

1. Theft and security. Anyone who gets a hold of the private key / scans the QR-code gets it.

2. Cause confusion with public/private keys and proper usage of the Bitcoin network. 

Anyway, the overall idea to to be able to give Bitcoin without any prerequisites and to lower the barriers even further. The educating part and setting up a wallet can come after receiving Bitcoin.

Look forward to any suggestions and feedback you might have to this concept.

The difference between me and people who hold currency..,"I actually own my money. 

No one is allowed to lend it out. 

If a bank run happens my private keys are forced to give me my funds. 

No one can give me a withdrawal limit or wire transfer limit. 

I can buy what i want when I want without a third party agreeing or not. 

I have money. They have currency. 

A government can’t print more of my currency it’s a pre determined supply.

10 Reasons Why Bitcoin is Better than Conventional Currency,"
1.    Theft resistance:
Stealing of bitcoins is not possible until the adversary have the private keys (usually kept offline) that are associated with the user wallet. In particular, Bitcoin provides security by design, for instance, unlike with credit cards you dont expose your secret (private key) whenever you make a transaction.

2.    Btc cannot be falsified, dollars well you know
When you transfer bitcoins to someone you don't hand over ""a bitcoin"". You submit a transaction to the network. The network makes sure your address is valid and has the proper value. So there is no risk of counterfeiting because there is nothing to counterfeit.

3.    Durability, Portability, Divisibility,
How do you destroy a number? Bitcoins are as durable as the owner makes the keys. If the only copy of the key is on a computer and you throw out the computer, the bitcoins die with the hard drive. If the proper precautions are taken, the keys are as durable as the medium. In order to destroy the network, you would need to eliminate all computers running the software. This includes the computer running in space. It is possible but unlikely.

You can just travel among different countries with millions in Btc, you just have to memorize your private key, here is where btc is much more portable than gold, cash and even bank transfers that can have several limitations.

Without a way to instantly transport gold from person to person, which is impossible without some sort of incredible breakthrough resulting in teleportation, then transportation costs, or the reliance on central vaults to store the gold, remain an issue. then, the gold itself is so useful for much of the technology we rely on today, as well as technology that is being developed, that our gold supply is truly needed for industrial uses. For the first time in history, humans are actually “consuming” gold

Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Currently, 1 bitcoin can only be broken down into 100,000,000 smaller units, known as satoshis. However, that limit is not set in stone. If, at some point, more than 2,100,000,000,000,000, or 2.1 quadrillion, units of currency are needed, then it would not be difficult to allow the currency to be broken down to another decimal point or two.

4.    It’s borderless. You could go to any country and use it.
It is safer to carry bitcoins than to carry cash, especially if you bring a large amount of money or if you’re travelling to a country with higher crime rates. Bitcoin is easy to exchange to major local currencies, if you plan to travel to multiple countries and wish to avoid the hassle of exchanging money.

If the establishment doesn’t accept bitcoin payments, sell your bitcoins (through LocalBitcoins) or withdraw your money from ATMs with the help of payment cards.

5.    It’s not subject to the whims of a government. The supply is constant and the price is determined by free market demand.
We can know how many bitcoin will be circulating in ten, twenty or seventy years, for example, are you able you know how many US dollars will be circulating at that moment, or how many of your fiduciary currency will be printed?

6.    Bitcoin transactions are instant.
When a bitcoin is sent, the transaction immediately begins to spread through the network. The recipient can see that they have received the transaction instantly, or within a few seconds. Then, once it has been fully confirmed, it would be statistically improbable for it to be invalid. I would say impossible, but that is not completely true. However, after a few confirmations, you are more likely to win the lottery than have a transaction turn out to be invalid.

7.    Secure store of value.
This use case is crucial in environments where citizens cannot trust that institutions will be responsible stewards of their hard-earned money. Consider the tragic case of a country like Venezuela, where individuals’ property and savings can be confiscated by authorities through law or inflation. Many Venezuelans are unfortunately unable to access traditional forms of exit such as emigration or stealthily accruing more stable sovereign currencies. With cryptocurrency, more Venezuelans have an alternative: They can opt to purchase or mine a secure store of value that cannot be confiscated or inflated away by their government because they alone control their private keys. (Indeed, cryptocurrencies are especially popular in Venezuela for precisely this reason.)

It is also very useful to send and receive remittances without paying high fees and only with your mobile, without having to go to a money exchanger physically

8.    Smart contracts.
For example, let’s say that Alice would like to gift her granddaughter, Erin, with a sum of money upon her 18th birthday. Today, Alice’s option is basically to hire a lawyer to create a trust that will hold the funds and disburse them on the appointed date. Being a technologically-savvy grandmother, however, Alice knows that she can simply program a smart contract to do the same thing without having to employ an intermediary. Alice creates a cryptocurrency wallet for herself and another for her granddaughter Erin. Alice sends the equivalent of $10,000 to her wallet and programs a smart contract. The contract is set up so that on the day of Erin’s birthday—let’s say January 3, 2027—the contract will automatically move the funds from Alice’s wallet directly to Erin’s, where she will have complete control of those funds. Once Alice sets the transaction in motion, she no longer has access to the funds, just as if she had created a trust. (it works also for inheritances)

9.    It’s banking the unbanked. You can bypass the traditional banking system, avoid surveillance, and get rid of hefty fees.
Cryptocurrencies remove the need to rely on this trusted third party to make a transaction. In effect, a cryptocurrency replaces a third party like Bank of America or PayPal with the network itself, which is managed by a distributed web of computers all across the world. This means that Alice can make a payment online directly to Bob whenever and wherever she wants, without needing to introduce another party which may be cumbersome or expensive. This also means that people without access to banking services can now take part in digital commerce.

Programmers, developers, online teachers, designers and anyone who can do online work can benefit from this bitcoin advantage, especially in poorer countries where most people can not access international bank accounts.

10.                      Bitcoin has no risk of credit card fraud or credit card chargebacks,
Compared to traditional payment methods, bitcoin is an attractive prospect for business owners, Bitcoin has no risk of credit card fraud or credit card chargebacks,This is a huge problem for the travel industry because the payments are often large.

For example, many European or American online stores block or avoid receiving credit card payments from Africa because of the fraud risks, with bitcoin, online stores could accept purchases from customers from Africa without chargeback risks, both parties win, the Buyers can access the merchandise and sellers can sell without risk.

Thoughts on Trustory?,"What I really want is mechanism by which being right can be enough, sans formal education and experience. I want to be able to financially back claims in order to establish credibility. I want to be able to put money on the table so that if anyone can prove me wrong, it goes to them. 

I also want there to be better incentive mechanisms for veracity in mainstream news media and in medical literature. 

I’m not sure if Trustory can accomplish any of this. I haven’t actually read the white paper. 

But I’m concerned about the standard for truth being the “knowledge of crowds.” This is a dangerous concept if the crowd doesn’t meet “wise crowd” criteria. The standard for truth should be evidence based rather than consensus based.

Group and Institution Custodial Solution - right here right now.,"Bitcoin already has the tools for institutions!  


Here is a solid way to do it...

Put funds in a 4 of 6 multi sig where 3 sigs are from the board members and 3 sigs from Accounting firms.  
The accounting firms would have no incentive to collude and that eliminates that risk.

The board can have 3x redundancy to keep the keys safe where only 1 of 3 board member is needed to move the funds.    
Enron type collusion would not be possible without an auditor signing off.

Some questions on the Lightning Network,"I get that the basic premise of the Lightning Network is for peer-to-peer exchanges of Bitcoin that have been pooled into a multi-signature address, such that only this pool is written into the blockchain and incurs a transaction fee (as does the closing of that address), thus making the transactions between two parties essentially free and instantaneous.

Is this a kind-of 'work around' of an inherent flaw of the Bitcoin network? In other words, why the sort of 'codified middle-man'? Is the very premise of the Lightning Network itself an admission of the inefficiency and cost of direct peer-to-peer exchange? As in, it presents itself as a 'solution' to high transaction fees and waiting time, when in fact it's more of a work-around to what's already there?",1533636719,07/08/2018 10:11:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95acz2/some_questions_on_the_lightning_network/,1

Introducing IcoCryptex.io - CryptoCurrency Exchange,"We are proud to announce that **IcoCryptex.io** has opened its doors for users in the **Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany and South Africa**! We’ll be adding more countries in the ñear future!

As we are a new Exchange, we are still looking for our first users! That is why the first 100 accounts in augustus will receive a **registration bonus of $25** ($12.50 in BTC &amp; $12.50 in a random coin).

Furthermore, there are **no trading fees** until 1 september 2018!

Our fees will be competitive after that time and any changes to them will be communicated at least a month in advance. 

We do active Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring and require your identity to be verified, which is inline with Know your Customer (KYC) regulations. To make this process as easy as possible we use an identity-verification-service, this means that 99% of users in the countries above can get verified instantly and start trading in minutes.

IcoCryptex is based in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and does not hide in an offshore country where regulations are questionable or non-existent. We make sure that we adhere to the laws, so that we will not be shutdown by the government. Many other exchange will most probably suffer from these future regulations.

Issue with Bittrex,"I’m having a small issue with Bittrex that is kind of annoying.

I stopped using Bittrex a few months ago but I have .0186 BTC (~$130 USD) left in my wallet. I want to transfer all of it out to another wallet I have but I keep getting an error saying “please verify the amount”

I just want to have all of my BTC in one place at this point but I can’t transfer it out.

We are building a secure mobile wallet system called AirGap,"[AirGap.it](https://airgap.it) is a wallet solution, allowing the secure storage of secrets on a mobile phone with an approach of two mobile apps. Depending on the security needed these apps can be installed on separate devices or on the same device.

To get the highest security, the AirGap Vault application is installed on a dedicated or old smartphone, which will never be connected to any network again. With the enhanced entropy concept that adds video, audio, accelerator and touch data to the entropy seed alongside the device’s pre-shipped secure random generator it is possible to generate a cryptographically secure seed used for the secret generation on that very same device. This secret never leaves the device it was generated on. The private key is saved in the secure enclave of the mobile device and needs multi-step biometric authentication every time it is accessed to perform cryptographic primitives.

AirGap Wallet on the other hand will be installed on a user’s everyday phone. With this app, users can manage their portfolio of wallets and their valuations. AirGap Wallet deals only with publicly available information as opposed to AirGap Vault, which handles the private key.

**How does a transaction work?** [Detailed step by step guide.](https://medium.com/airgap-it/airgap-the-step-by-step-guide-bff36d50a4ed)

1.	Users can create a new transaction with an address, amount and a fee in AirGap Wallet.
2.	A QR code with this transaction is generated.
3.	This QR code is scanned with AirGap Vault, ensuring one-way communication only with QR codes.
4.	To sign the transaction the secure enclave is accessed with biometric authentication.
5.	The signed transaction is displayed in a QR code.
6.	The QR code is scanned by AirGap Wallet and broadcasted to the blockchain. 

**What if I want to manage smaller amounts?**

AirGap Vault and AirGap Wallet can also be installed on the same device. In this case, the communication between the two apps works with app switching through an URL scheme. This allows the two apps to be entirely encapsulated, which is crucial: For example, AirGap Vault does not have any network permissions and thus is unable to send information out over the network, guaranteed by the operating systems sandboxing.


**Which coins and token do you support?**

Currently we support the Bitcoin and a few other currencies thanks to the blockchain agnostic approach. We plan to extend this list in the future. These are all managed by the same private key/mnemonic secret.

We would be more than happy to get your feedback, comments and suggestions. You can also find more information on [AirGap.it](https://airgap.it) or on our [Telegram](https://t.me/AirGap) channel.

Introducing IcoCryptex.io - CryptoCurrency Exchange (x-post r/IcoCryptex),"We are proud to announce that **IcoCryptex.io** has opened its doors for users in the **Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany and South Africa**! We’ll be adding more countries in the ñear future!

As we are a new Exchange, we are still looking for our first users! That is why the first 100 accounts in augustus will receive a **registration bonus of $25** ($12.50 in BTC &amp; $12.50 in a random coin).

Furthermore, there are **no trading fees** until 1 september 2018!

Our fees will be competitive after that time and any changes to them will be communicated at least a month in advance.

We do active Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring and require your identity to be verified, which is inline with Know your Customer (KYC) regulations. To make this process as easy as possible we use an identity-verification-service, this means that 99% of users in the countries above can get verified instantly and start trading in minutes.

IcoCryptex is based in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and does not hide in an offshore country where regulations are questionable or non-existent. We make sure that we adhere to the laws, so that we will not be shutdown by the government. Many other exchange will most probably suffer from these future regulations.

If you have any questions, or you see any bugs, please contact us using the [Support page](https://icocryptex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or by answering in this thread or our subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IcoCryptex](https://www.reddit.com/r/IcoCryptex)**.**

We would love to hear your Feedback on functionality and the user interface. Of course we made sure that the site is secure and ready for the Beta-phase.

At the moment IcoCryptex.io is only available in English. However, we are working on other versions (e.g. Dutch).

Fractional Reserve BTC exchanges?,"So if exchanges are running fraction reserves of bitcoin (buying and selling more coins than they actually have on the assumption everyone doesn't cash out at once)  then this could suppress the price of BTC via artificial supply.

Money,"“So you think that money is the root of all evil?” said Francisco d’Anconia. “Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?

“When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor–your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money, Is this what you consider evil?

“Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions–and you’ll learn that man’s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.

“But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is *made–*before it can be looted or mooched–made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume more than he has produced.’

“To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss–the recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery–that you must offer them values, not wounds–that the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of *goods*. Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men’s stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by trade–with reason, not force, as their final arbiter–it is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability–and the degree of a man’s productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?

“But money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality–the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.

“Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if he’s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if he’s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil?

“Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth–the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?

“Money is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to men’s vices or men’s stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a moment’s or a penny’s worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then you’ll scream that money is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money?

“Money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money?

“Or did you say it’s the *love* of money that’s the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. It’s the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money–and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.

“Let me give you a tip on a clue to men’s characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.

“Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper’s bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another–their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.

“But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich–will not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt–and of his life, as he deserves.

“Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standard–the men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money–the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-law–men who use force to seize the wealth of *disarmed* victims–then money becomes its creators’ avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they’ve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.

“Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion–when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing–when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors–when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don’t protect you against them, but protect them against you–when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice–you may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.

“Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men’s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, ‘Account overdrawn.’

“When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, ‘Who is destroying the world? You are.

“You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why it’s crumbling around you, while you’re damning its life-blood–money. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout men’s history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves–slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody’s mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers–as industrialists.

“To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a *country of money*–and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, man’s mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human being–the self-made man–the American industrialist.

“If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose–because it contains all the others–the fact that they were the people who created the phrase ‘to *make* money.’ No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity–to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words ‘to make money’ hold the essence of human morality.

“Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters’ continents. Now the looters’ credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide– as, I think, he will.

“Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns–or dollars.

Money Instrument to Short Sell Bitcoin?,"I cashed into BTC and ETH late January of this year.  I underestimated the bottom, and needless to say, my portfolio hasn't shown any return yet.

It dropped 10 points by the time I finished this paragraph.  I figured I can take advantage of the bear market.

Does anyone know an institution/exchange where I can short sell BTC?  Ideally I want a list of some good ones to look into and consider other factors.  If so, what are the prerequisites to short sell and how soon would I expect a margin call?

Wouldn't it be great to earn a little bit of Bitcoin every day from as little as $500?,"Right now people are rushing to get their hands on as much Bitcoin as possible and there are only a few ways you can do this...

https://i.redd.it/a8j60j5t2re11.gif

1. You can buy it from an exchange and hold it

2. You can trade it for goods or services

3. You can mine it!

Option 1 and 2 are both good ideas... In fact, if you have a business that currently accepts credit cards you should really look into setting up a Bitcoin merchant account like Bitpay so you can start accepting Bitcoin.

**But Option 3 is the most lucrative... Mining Bitcoin!**

[BitClub Network](https://bitclubnetwork.com/wesleybtc/aboutus.html) has set up a strategic platform that allows you to use your existing Bitcoin and purchase mining hardware that is used to mine for Bitcoin. When you purchase a share in our mining pool you will earn Bitcoin for 1,000 days while continually re-purchasing more hardware to get a bigger piece of our global mining operation.

The idea is to multiply your Bitcoin so at the end of 1,000 days you have a lot more Bitcoin than you started with.

Just about everyone expects Bitcoin to go up significantly over the next few years based on simple supply and demand, many are even predicting the price as high as $250 000 USD for 1 Bitcoin.

Let's say this statement ends up being true and in 3 years Bitcoin is $250 000k, which would you rather have...

1. A. You buy $500 worth of Bitcoin (lets call it 2 Bitcoin), in 3 years it would be worth $500 000 USD
2. B. You buy a mining share for $500 worth of Bitcoin and after 3 years you might have 5, 7 or even 10 Bitcoin. This would be worth A LOT more than if you just bought Bitcoin and held it.

But that's not all... During this 3 years you have been taking your mining earnings and re-purchasing additional mining shares and you may have earned multiple shares that each have their own 1,000 day contracts.

It's a no brainer decision and that's why we have some many people jumping into our mining pool right now from all over the world.

And the very best part... The faster and bigger we get, the larger our mine becomes and the more Bitcoin we can mine.

So don't go another day without earning your Bitcoin!

There was one thing she didn't understand...,"I   just like everyone else was excited by the fact that Bitcoin had just   broken above the $8000 mark and saw this as a golden opportunity at the   early stages of a raging bull market so I did what any ""rational""  person  would do and logged into my BitMEX account; this is where the  disaster  started.

At $8132, I was 50x  leveraged  and minutes after that, news about the Winkelvos ETF came out  and I  panic Tweeted ""Bitcoin is about to tank"" but at that very  moment, I also  became the best HODLer every and very miserable at the  same time. My  girlfriend tried to cheer me up but to no avail and it  led to this:

I know there are a lot of liberals on here but face the facts, Alex Jones has helped bitcoin reach a lot of folks along with Max Keiser.

It's stupid to write off Alex Jones as ""omgzzzzz conspiracie theories tin foil hatzz durrrrr im so funny and kewl cuz i say deez tings""

The guy spouts  A LOT OF FACTS if you actually listen to him.

He's not perfect, but he's 1,000,000x better than fake news CNN and the lies from corrupt govts/corporations (facebook/google/youtube/etc).

These nazis want to censor you, tell you what to think, how to think, not to question, to only FOLLOW their narrative.

Spotlight: SolidX Mission Statement,"It seems like many in the community are familiar with SolidX as a part of a sentence reading ""SEC Delays VanEck-SolidX Bitcoin ETF Decision to September"". Here is something I found interesting from their ""Company IPO Overview""

TLDR: 

&gt;Shares are issued by the Trust only in blocks of 100,000 Shares called “Baskets”
principally in exchange for cash from certain registered broker-dealers or other
securities market participants (“Authorized Participants”).

Quick Math
Current Price: $6647.63 (time of posting) x 100,000 =  $664,763,000 per ""Basket"".

Full Text Via [Nasdaq  Link](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/solidx-bitcoin-trust-998826-81288):

&gt;**Company Description**

&gt;A bitcoin is an asset that can be transferred among parties via the Internet,
but without the use of a central administrator or clearing agency. Bitcoin with
an upper case “B” describes the system as a whole (i.e., the network of
computers running the software protocol underlying bitcoin involved in
maintaining the database of bitcoin ownership and facilitating the transfer of
bitcoin among parties). When written with a lower case “b”, the word bitcoin
refers to the unit of account within the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network
and the asset, bitcoin, are intrinsically linked and inseparable.

&gt;The Bitcoin network, which has existed since 2009, can be used both as a value
transfer system (i.e. the transfer of bitcoin from one party to another) and for
non-financial applications. Development of the Bitcoin network’s usage for
non-financial applications has become increasingly prominent, including
applications such as: asset title transfer, secure timestamping, counterfeit and
fraud detection systems, secure document and contract signing, distributed cloud
storage and identity management. As a mechanism purely for the transfer of
value, the Bitcoin network has processed more than 190 million transactions
since its inception. More than 100,000 merchants accept bitcoin for goods and
services. To date, venture capitalists have invested more than $1 billion in
businesses related to Bitcoin and the blockchain, the technology underlying the
Bitcoin network.

&gt;SolidX Bitcoin Trust (the “Trust”) was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on
September 15, 2016. The Trust is governed by the Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (“Trust Agreement”) dated February 1,
2017 between SolidX Management LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Delaware Trust Company
(the “Trustee”). The Trust will issue common units of beneficial interest, or
“Shares,” which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in
the Trust’s net assets. The Trust’s assets will consist of bitcoin, the unit of
account within the Bitcoin network as described in the preceding paragraphs. The
Trust will occasionally hold cash for short periods in connection with the
Basket creation and redemption process, and to pay the Sponsor’s Management Fee,
the bitcoin Insurance Fee and any other Trust expenses and liabilities not
assumed by the Sponsor.

&gt;The Shares provide shareholders with the opportunity to access the bitcoin
market though a traditional brokerage account. The Sponsor believes that
shareholders will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical
asset allocation strategies that use bitcoin by investing in the Shares than by
purchasing, holding and trading bitcoin directly. The value of bitcoin will be
reported on the Trust’s website daily as measured by the TradeBlock Bitcoin
Index (“XBX”).

&gt;Shares are issued by the Trust only in blocks of 100,000 Shares called “Baskets”
principally in exchange for cash from certain registered broker-dealers or other
securities market participants (“Authorized Participants”). Baskets will be
redeemed by the Trust principally in exchange for the amount of cash 
corresponding to their redemption value. Baskets may also be created or redeemed
partially or wholly in exchange for bitcoin at the discretion of the Sponsor if
the Authorized Participant can convey bitcoin directly to the Trust. The Trust
issues and redeems Baskets on an ongoing basis at net asset value (“NAV”) to
Authorized Participants who have entered into a contract with the Sponsor and
the Transfer Agent.

&gt;Individual Shares will not be redeemed by the Trust, but are expected to be
listed for trading. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and is not required to
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. The Trust is
not a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as
amended, and the Sponsor is not subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor.

&gt;Shareholders may purchase and sell Shares through traditional brokerage
accounts. Secondary market purchases and sales of Shares are subject to
customary brokerage commissions and charges. Shareholders are encouraged to
review the terms of their brokerage accounts for applicable charges.

&gt;The market price of the Shares may not be identical to the NAV per Share. The
intra-day indicative value per Share is based on the prior day’s final NAV per
Share, adjusted every 15 seconds throughout the day to reflect the continuous
price changes of the Trust’s bitcoin holdings, to provide a continuously updated
indicative intra-day value per Share. The Trust is not involved in or
responsible for the calculation or dissemination of the indicative intra-day
value per Share and makes no warranty as to the accuracy of the indicative
intra-day value per Share.

___

&gt;The offices of the Trust and the Sponsor are located at 200 Park Avenue, New
York, New York 10166 and the Trust’s telephone number is (212) 273-9585. The
office of the Trustee is located at 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, Delaware
19808. The offices of the Administrator, Transfer Agent and Cash Custodian are
located at 2 Hanson Place, Brooklyn, New York 11217. The offices of the Order
Examiner are located at Three Canal Plaza, Suite 100, Portland, Maine 04101.

4. ICE/Starbucks/Microsoft plans will likely increase demand
5. One way or another, the SEC is more likely than ever to approve an ETF within the next 9 months. This will vastly increase demand

Isn’t Lightning inherently flawed in several ways?,"LN seems to be flawed in at least 2 ways:

1. You can’t receive payment if you are offline.

Unlike Bitcoin, where I can send money to anyone anywhere, any time, and the amount will be added to the recipient’s balance, LN requires that the recipient will be online to receive it, which requires coordination.

Of course you can hire the services of a 3rd party to be online for you, but how is that different than a bank? What if he refuses? What if he’s legally forced not to accept payments on your behalf? What prevents him charging a lot of money?

Isn’t Bitcoin all about removing the middleman and allow P2P payments?

2. You need to be *always* online, even when you are not receiving payment, or pay a 3rd party watchtower.

This is needed, so if I open a channel with someone, and he pays me through the channel, he can still submit the original state to the blockchain, undoing his payment.

This can be prevented by submitting the latest state to the blockchain, but it requires either being always online, or hiring a 3rd party watchtower to do it for you (which goes back to all the problems I mentioned with trusting 3rd parties).

I honestly don’t understand why people believe this is a viable solution. It can be useful in some scenarios, but it changes the entire premise, and doesn’t seem to be Bitcoin any more.

I have a few other remarks about attacking and influencing the routing, but they are not as significant as these two.",1533700590,08/08/2018 03:56:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95ip70/isnt_lightning_inherently_flawed_in_several_ways/,1

Please help,"My dog Max has a tumor that is making him lose his eye and eventually kill him if i don't treat him. Such tumors usually have good chance of being treated and the vet thinks that he has a good chance if we start with the treatment soon. However as a recent graduate i have a problem affording the budget for the treatment, just an MRI test would cost about 1500$ along with another 2000$-3000$ for the treatment.  I could afford to pay about half of the treatment costs and I am trying to fund-raise the rest.  Max is a great dog and he has been my best friend since 2013 and a source of emotional support for me and any help would be greatly appreciated. I am accepting donations via bitcoin (19SdqR5Dzv3b6LTyThoSKytfQthNXrxdem) or through the attached gofundme page where i will be posting  updates about the situation.

Mining vs Trading," I’d like to challenge one common crypto reddit theme: the idea that “trading” is a path to riches through crypto.  It isn’t. Trading is very difficult and to do it well is a full time job. Be an investor not a trader. Be patient, diversify, be selective, research &amp; HOLD. If you cannot mine alone, mine in pools. There's companies that allows that. Top one is Bitclub

 My advice:  step back &amp; get a big picture view of crypto: where you think it will go &amp; what the landscape will be in 5 years - what projects you think will survive and have value - then make long term investments based on that view / theory / philosophy- and adjust on new info.",1533717267,08/08/2018 08:34:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95k931/mining_vs_trading/,1

Chance to Earn Money in the Bear Market that You should not Miss out,"Cryptocurrency is said to be in the bear market from the beginning of 2018, and more than two-thirds of bitcoin value have been lost in this tough period. Can you hold on? Now, it’s time to not struggle against the bitcoin winter as I will share you a new way to earn money even if the bear market is still on.

自2018年初，数字货币就开始进入熊市，比特币失去了超过三分之二的价值。在这种情况下，你还挺得住么？现在，无需再在比特币寒冬中垂死挣扎了，我将分享你在熊市中盈利的方法。

Future trading, extremely different from all the traditional trading forms, is a kind of short-selling without fee that bets on the trend of market. That’s said, you can buy either increasing or declining price of bitcoin with certain ratio of your coins, and betting on the declining price in the bear market can also bring you profit. 

合约交易，一种完全不同于所有其他传统比特币交易的形式，是一种根据市场行情来下注的做空的方式。也就是说，你可以买涨也可以买跌，而即使在熊市中你可以通过买跌来赚钱。

Put it simple, given you have 10 BTC, and bet on the declining price with 10x leverage using 2 BTC, and sell all when the price falls at $6000 from the current $6600, you will get $6000\*10 plus the declined $600\*2\*10,totally, $72000, and you earn $72000 minus the original $66000, namely, $6000.

简单说来，假如你有10个比特币，用其中的2个比特币做20倍的杠杆来买跌。当比特币从当前的6600跌至6000的时候，抛出。最终你账户里将有6000\*10，加上20倍买跌的600，总共72000. 你赚了72000-66000，共6000元。

Notice that future trading is a high-profit &amp; high-risk investment, the beginning ratio to get profit should be over 10%, however, you will suffer great loss if you bet on too much. So, just be cautious and rational. Nowadays, few exchanges offers future trading, and among which, OKEx exchange, one of the most-well known platforms that provides two options in future trading, namely, 10x and 20x, is the most ideal choice for investor who want to embrace the hope surviving in the bear market.

Main Reasons Why BTC Doesn't Go Up,"One of The Main Reasons Why BTC Doesn't Go Up Like Before and Keeps on Dumping is Margin Trading Platforms and One of The Big One is BitMEX

Yes...!! BitMEX

Bcoz These Guys Liquidates Our Small Positions Like Crazy......!!

Let's Say 80% People Know That BTC Will Pump Up from 6000 Support and Mostly What People and Us Will Do 

Yes, We Will Open LONG Positions

and Whats Gonna Happen Next
BitMEX Will Liquidate Our Positions By SHORTING BTC....!!

That's Why You Will See Large Large Wicks on 1Hr. or 30 Min Candles

How Does This Work? 

Let's Say, Price Will See a Pump from 6000 But The Candle will Go Below 6000 And after Liquidating Your Position Price Will Bump Up and Will Close The Candle Above 6000 by Making a Wick on Candles

That's Why We Strongly Recommend You to Put Stop-Loss on Every Trade

The SEC Will Not Approve ETF if These Kinda Manipulations keep on Happening Time to Time, Bcoz They Don't Want People to Lose Money During This Manipulations/ Pump and Dumps on BTC

ETF Proposals will Keep on Coming and SEC Will Keep on Rejecting Them Up

"Hi, questions regarding 'Bitcointalk.org'","This is a bit more of a technical area rather than a general one. 

So I might be asking in the wrong forum, but have no idea where to post these types of questions... here it goes.

At '[bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org)', there is a thing called 'signature campaigns'. Basically, having a sigil, a badge, a namecard... of some project stuck to your profile so that you can indirectly promote their said project. This is followed by a compensation of sorts, in accordance with how many quality content posts/replies that you have made.. well this is how far I have understood the concept, tell me if I'm wrong. 

Anyhoo, in order to make the said compensation (mostly in forms of financial methods), the team of the said project must be able to track how the users with their signature are doing - they need to count the posts, replies, decide which is legit for payment and whatnot. This is mostly done by campaign managers I believe? So, if, hypothetically, there is no campaign manger involved and the task is up to the project's team, how would one conduct such research? Like, how do you determine how many posts/replies a person has made on a specific topic? 

Is there a advanced search option somewhere that I am not seeing?

Also, if the said project is not planning to utilize an escrow account, well maybe cause they have trust issues for the market, would that be detrimental? give off the wrong image to the potential legendary/hero signature-bearers?

Thank you for your time in advance. ",1533726753,08/08/2018 11:12:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95l30m/hi_questions_regarding_bitcointalkorg/,1

Thoughts for encouragement,"Dear community,

This has been a tough year so far. It will likely end as much. The eye-widening bull run we had in 2017 was destined to end this way in hindsight, seeing all the newcomers, including our friends and family, join the hype. Bitcoin had always seen bull runs, but this time the magnitude was so high it drew serious international intrigue.

This was good for Bitcoin. It began to draw quiet investment from big businesses looking to make it mainstream. They are thinking long term with confidence, and so should we. Financial institutions and media continue to deride it. Every time I see an article from Bloomberg I groan by natural reaction. However these same institutions know they can quickly find themselves left behind. ICE's announcement of Bakkt came as a surprise with how quickly things are moving. Goldman Sachs, which has been ""looking into"" bitcoin with zero progress since the start of the year, had to remind us shortly after ICE's announcement that they too are continuing to ""look into it."" I'm sure many other institutions realize they need to start making real progress now.

Time is on Bitcoin's side. It's not going away. It's grown from worthless to hundreds of billions. This does not happen by random probability. The need for sound money is becoming ever more important in an environment of high debts, low growth, trade wars, and instability from low oil prices. 

We continue to see nauseating volatility in Bitcoin because it is still very new and largely seen as speculative. This is natural. For bitcoin to reach maturity, we *need* speculation to *propel* it to the next evolutionary phase: a legitimate form of value. It's a necessary evil. The fact we're dealing with such volatility reminds us how early we still are, and just how far Bitcoin has to go.

In my mind, Bitcoin *has* to win out due to natural economic forces. The first purely *digital* asset that is immune to arbitration, seizure, or supply inflation will 100% certain be a major global asset. 

Bitcoin also will win out handily versus similar altcoins. Bitcoin has no official leadership team, which makes it seem inferior to some, but actually solidifies trust that the core parameters will never change against non-consensus or quick changes. Over the long term this will become more apparent. The more scams that pop up the quicker people will realize this. If your altcoin has a dedicated team behind it, then you essentially have a digital form of fiat, with no legal assurances they cannot increase supply to raise funds, or change technical design without sufficient scrutiny.

From a 10,000 foot view, the bull run of 2017 was always going to lead to 2018's year of regulatory discussion and institutional pipe building. Retail investors were burned and demoralized and are not going to come back for a long time. For Bitcoin to again grow by magnitudes from $100B it will need institutional interest. This will be focus point for price growth over the next 3 years.

However, there is asymmetric upside. Bitcoin is a Hydra with many heads. If retailers look for alternatives around high-Visa fees (Kroger) or looking to better connect with Millenials (Starbucks), we can see leading retailers jump on the bandwagon very soon. Especially if they have the option to convert payment to USD (Bakkt). This is progress.

Subreddit bitcoin vs btc,"I've tried to make the most sense of it. It is my understanding that some people believe bitcoin cash is the truest to satoshis  vision. Those same people claim this subreddit is more censored and is corrupt.

It's odd because I just go about my business and once in a while post a link to a way to earn satoshis (against both subreddit rules). But funnily enough, I am banned from r/btc (the supposed free speech subreddit that is pro bitcoin cash because it is closest to satoshis vision) but I can post here.... me thinks there is more to all of this then what the pro bitcoin cash people think.

My original opinion on bitcoin cash was that roger ver found a way to essentially duplicate btc and turn it into bitcoin cash by simply making the excuse that the block size needed to be increased.

Can someone with knowledge on all of this share a non bias opinion?  I think my original perspective was more accurate and the fact I'm banned there and not here really flies in the face of what pro-bunch people claim is going on.",1533747519,08/08/2018 16:58:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95ntbp/subreddit_bitcoin_vs_btc/,1

Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Opportunity Calculator,"Dear investors,

I opened few days ago a thread about my project but I think now that a presentation is necessary.

I will present the project [crossd.io](https://crossd.io) and our first tool [RTCA (Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Opportunity Calculator)](https://rtca.crossd.io/)

**About us**

We initialized the project Crossd few months ago with a simple objective : developing financial algorithms for cryptocurrencies market.  

We are two on this project, my friend who is a French Ph.D student in Computer Science and myself a  Swiss student in master of Science in Finance. This project is done beside studies so it's not a firm but we are now pretty proud of the result and we hope you will appreciate it.

**RTCA**

Our first tool is RTCA for Real Time Cryptocurrencies Arbitrages which is a crypto arbitrage calculator platform. 

The platform allows you to overview, track and filter arbitrages opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. 

It also provides a step-by-step guide to exploit the arbitrage opportunity to make a profit as you can see just below:

*Processing img 0ucy4i31swe11...*

In terms of features, our arbitrage trading platform is able to retrieve in real time fees from exchanges (exchange,withdraw,deposit) and also withdrawal and deposit status. Arbitrages displayed are only arbitrages you execute right now. 

The platform is also capable to do triangular arbitrage so by unchecking exchanges (except one) you will see arbitrages on the same exchange. 

Our open pair mode allows you to make arbitrage with different initial / final cryptocurrency based on their USD/EUR value. (e.g. BTC-&gt;NANO-&gt;ETH with more ETH worth USD than your initial amount of BTC)

We have an advanced mode in which you can specify manually the amount you have on each exchange and our platform will calculate the arbitrage with your amount and only display crypto arbitrages you can afford.

After clicking on a cryptocurrency arbitrage, our platform will keep your position up-to-date and tells you in real time how much you will earn/loose even few days later.

Finally, we have numerous filters to improve cryptocurrency arbitrage trading and we support for the moment 7 exchanges and more than 350 currencies. We will add new exchanges in the next days and each added exchange increase the arbitrages opportunities exceptionally so our 1'500 arbitrages in average will be really small in a near future.

 (Note: we are planning to create a web socket to let you automatize what you want)

[Visual of RTCA \(https:\/\/rtca.crossd.io\)](https://i.redd.it/n1qcdkzzrwe11.png)

**Restricted access**

This project is made for only few experimented investors because arbitrages opportunities are not infinite. We do provide a subscription plan in order to support the development of the platform and restrict the use of it. The prices are really low because our goal is not to generate tons of revenues (it would not be possible with this project) but only to receive a support from users they can earn back by using our platform. (It is the case now)

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I am really grateful that you read this topic completely and very proud of this project .

I hope you will like it as much as I do.

We would love to hear your feedback or questions so don't hesitate really (really). 

We want to improve our tool and the only way is by getting your feedback.

Bitmain violatin GPLv3 license again this time for software in the Antminer Z9 firmware,"## 

I contacted Bitmain on August 4th 2018 via their support system to request the Complete Corresponding GPL source code to the cgminer 4.9.0 mining software that they use on the [Antminer Z9](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020180731170836994pJs2YSp106B1). They have so far failed to comply with the request and their support agent ""Barbara"" has only given excuses for why it hasn't been uploaded yet. Giving GitHub repository links from back in 2016!.

The GPL licenses for the cgminer require they make complete source code available at the same time as the binary:

&gt;For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.

What they have uploaded to their GitHub so far is outdated, incomplete and is missing components necessary to compile. The GPL also requires that they provide the source code for every firmware version they release, although I only requested they provide the source code for the latest version so far.",1533755469,08/08/2018 19:11:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95p157/bitmain_violatin_gplv3_license_again_this_time/,1

"Breakdown: ""financialization"" of Bitcoin through alt markets and USDT?","I'm seeing responses to  this selloff focus on the SEC's decision to postpone the ETF. People are saying things like ""how is it possible that postponement of a decision can lead to  a selloff like this? "" I can't be the only person unsatisfied with the lack of a clear answer to that.

Part of the answer I'm providing to myself is that **there is more than one reason we are selling off right now.** I'm entertaining the possibility that the SEC decision isn't even the most important factor in this selloff.

## If the selloff isn't caused by the ETF decision then why did they happen at the same time?

Shit happens. Sometimes events trigger moves in markets that have been set up for a long time. The result of something like that is a systemc breakdown. Sound familiar?

Also, the selloff started July 29th, well before the decision to delay. The selloff and the SEC's decision to delay seems to be irrationally linked by some; Sure, the selloff continued and picked up speed, but there's no reason to believe that the market wasn't primed to do that already.
 
## What else is important?

Volume is important. More specifically, where capital is flowing to and from.

https://coinlib.io/global-crypto-charts?theme=dark#global_money_flow

We're seeing alt hoarders sell everything (including their BTC) into tether and cashing out to fiat (look at the volume moving in and out of the Yen!!!). We're probably losing about 100 million tether a week from the system right now. 3 weeks ago there were 2.7 billion. Today there are 2.4. That's substantial because money that's leaving the system through tether may not come back.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/

If nobody is depositing cash to buy tether then all tether can (and will?) leave the CC ecosystem. That's 2.4 billion USD of bear pressure available... and I'm starting to believe that can sell out.

## What happens without economic incentive to create more tether?

2.7 billion less liquidity is a big hit to the total CC market cap. I'm not even sure how to estimate the impact, but it will be substantially more than a 2.4 billion USD drop in the net CC market cap. 

## Consider the CC space without tether. 

If alts aren't relevant to this selloff then why are they dropping in value faster than Bitcoin? Why have they been losing market cap for months?

You're watching the network effect of cryptos break down when tether leaves because without it you will observe deviations between exchanges that are 10% or more. We had tools to measure that kind of thing 2 years ago that don't even exist today. Today, exchange prices are so close that there's no reason to pay attention to it.

Arbitrage bots become more prominent in a world without tether... and a world with more arbitrage bots is a world that is much less efficient. Less efficiency means less profit and less upside potential on every trade.

## Financialization?

To understand what I'm getting at you should [listen to this podcast](http://www.bitcoin.kn/2018/08/caitlin-long-financialization/) or [read this article on forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2018/08/07/racing-to-fix-wall-street-ice-cryptocurrencies-and-enterprise-blockchain/#268ab665215e).

A sort of financialization has already occured in the CC space by way of alts and tether and the market is just starting to grasp the implications of that. If tether is gone, or so scarce that it might as well be, your options to cash out in most alt markets is probably limited to Bitcoin. 

**Think of the size of that squeeze.**

Similarly, if alts are less prominent in this space then there is less demand on available Bitcoin because there are fewer altcoins (which also have less value). As the alt market shrinks so does the demand for Bitcoin... but the Alt market also shrinks because everyone knows that there is more claim to bitcoin by way of altcoin market caps than there is Bitcoin to go around.

## Wow. Big claims there, Mr. Hates-All-Alts

First, I don't hate all alts. I'm categorically opposed to shitcoins. I'm not up for discussing what qualifies as a shitcoin to me, but I will admit that much bias.

Second, the amount of disgust some people show when I suggest this possibility that alts are somewhat culpable is telling. I'm happy to discuss details that I'm missing, but I don't think everyone is rationally engaging with the information that's available. 

When I read emotional responses, like the ones I've been getting in the daily discussion, I'm prone to asking questions. So, feel free to get emotional; but please be able to support your emotional response with observations, facts, and or quality arguments. Trying to discredit what I'm saying by slandering me isn't doing anybody any favors.

**Please be patient and help me think through this with you.**

I created an alias protocol for Bitcoin. So far only the Nano and Bitcoin Cash communities are interested... Take a look! I don't want the protocol to shift the market away from BTC in any way!,"OpenCAP is an alias protocol I created to compete with things like Namecoin and OpenAlias, which aren't really used or adopted well. OpenCAP is an easy to implement REST protocol that allows people to run their own servers so that they can use aliases instead of addresses when they want.

For example, I can tell you to pay me at [kvotheguy@ogdolo.com](mailto:kvotheguy@ogdolo.com) instead of b1i0ad78fspfiadfjdifsd8faud9fpsdufspfasdfui or whatever.

There are a couple advantages to using an alias:

1. An alias is easy to remember, and can be communicated verbally.
2. When an OpenCAP wallet does a lookup for an address, then routes a payment to that address, there is no room for a copy/paste hack or typo.
3. One alias can relate to many addresses (P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32, or even other coins) In other words, the sender can choose how to pay the receiver based on what kinds of coins/address types the receiver accepts.
4. Aliases don't need to change, but the addresses that are associated with it can update dynamically. For instance, in Bitcoin is is considered good practice to use a new address for each transaction, OpenCAP allows this to happen easily.
5. Aliases provide a natural way for apps to intercommunicate ""contact lists"". For instance, in the future I could see some sort of ""import"" feature where facebook allows you to associate your alias, and it can be imported into your friend's wallets.

Take a look at the protocol on github. I have a server ready to go that will be free to use for everyone, I just don't want to launch it until enough people have reviewed the protocol and we have tweaked it to be able to call it v1.0.0. If you like the idea reach out to your favorite wallet devs and let them know to take a look. We need wallets integrating in order for it to be a success.

I'm a researcher working on creating survey about cryptocurrency **and credit cards**. About the survey:

* It will be a statistically valid online survey by a highly reputable firm.

* We want to ask questions that will **generate discussion** and **raise awareness** among the general public about Bitcoin -- the target isn't the highly-educated people or /r/bitcoin (i.e. we're not going to ask which fork they support).

Some ideas we have so far include:

* What is your level of interest in a rewards credit card that paid you in Bitcoin?
* What is your level of interest in a credit card that allows you to pay for everyday expenses with Bitcoin?
* Should your bank be allowed to stop you from buying Bitcoin with your credit card?

Bitcoin ETF? Really?? Banksters are the problem. Bitcoin is the solution.,"**Trust**.  The banksters got that name for good reasons: they're know criminals.  There are now **two** classes of people in the US: banksters, and those who must obey all laws or face jail and/or penalties.  

Examples include, but are in no way limited to:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex\_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_scandal)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor\_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor_scandal)

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs)

Are you *willing to* ***trust*** *people like that* to hold your Bitcoins for you*?*  If so, what's the matter with you?

Banksters are the problem.  Bitcoin is the solution.

""*Your keys, your Bitcoin.  Not your keys, not your Bitcoin"" -- Andreas Antonopoulos*

Then, there's the possibility that the fund (ETF) you put your money into is being run by another Bernie Madoff kind of person who will send you quarterly statements, but hasn't actually invested a dime of your money.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard\_Madoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Madoff)

**Before you go spouting off about regulators and auditors, keep reading:**

It has been well known for some time that the government regulation agencies have a ""revolving door"" with the very entities they're supposed to be regulating.  People often leave government to go work for the places they were ***supposed to*** *be* regulating.  Sometimes people leave the banks to go regulate their ""buddies"".  Again, are you able and willing to **trust** them?  Not me.

Ask yourself, ""Where the hell were the auditors and regulators during Bernie Madoff's caper?"" 

**Trust** is just one of many reasons why a wise person should be **very cynical** about ETFs in general, and about Bitcoin ETFs specifically.",1533778025,09/08/2018 01:27:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95s3ts/bitcoin_etf_really_banksters_are_the_problem/,1

Here’s what makes the VanEck/SolidX ETF different... TL;DR,"If you don’t know what differentiates the VanEck and SolidX ETF and why it gives it a massive advantage over other ETFs that have been thus far rejected, here are the main points:

-Custody: Fund is physically backed and will hold BTC (Private Keys)

-Designed for institutions not retail: Minimum $200K investment. This gives the SEC more confidence in protecting retail investors.

-Backed by CBOE: to be traded on BZX Equities Exchange. CBOE has already pushed through Futures and has a long standing history with the SEC.

-Regulatory oversight: the CBOE is a trusted and regulated exchange in the eyes of the SEC

-Index will be traded on a OTC (over the counter) desk by Voice not Electronically: this reduces risk of manipulation and increases regulatory transparency.

-Insured: ETF is insured by a syndicate of A-rated insurers. Again, more assurance and protection for investors.

-Both VanEck and SolidX have filed for ETFs independently: together, they bring to the table more experience and lessons learned than any other applicant.

Well, there you have it. Other ETFs have had some of these components but nothing has come close to be as robust and comprehensive as this ETF.

The Delay is a sign of confidence, as. It demonstrates the SEC’s interest in continuing to do proper due diligence versus out right rejecting it.",1533779131,09/08/2018 01:45:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95s8l1/heres_what_makes_the_vanecksolidx_etf_different/,1

Extortion function?,"I don't really know anything about bitcoin.  But let's say somebody gave me a wallet? number, and they're literally extorting me.  What, if any, recourse is there?

But now, I have been asked to buy some bitcoin that I don't know how to buy to pay off some foreign national (they claim this, and I don't give a damn) to not release some porn related stuff that I also don't care about, not least of which it's largely impossible for these email phish cunts to have.

Economic question re: off-chain scaling,"Hello, this is my first post to this subreddit.

Basic economic/game theory question here.

For any off chain scaling techniques for BTC, would this not disincentivize miners from participating? Or, is the idea that regardless of off-chain activity, there will always be enough on-chain transactions to incentivize mining?

For example of an off chain solution other than Lightning: 

Bakkt retail solution appears to manage individual's balance via its own private ledger, which keeps track of your BTC present day value at time of transaction at a retail point of sale e.g. Starbucks, but no actual BTC transaction takes place unless absolutely necessary; bulk settlement transactions occur on chain only as needed, or deposits and withdrawals would happen on chain. 

In the end, if on-chain scale is simply too expensive to use, then the people who are incentivized to mine are those few companies who have large, concentrated volumes of off-chain transactions (Banks 2.0).

Is this the end game, to essentially concentrate mining only to a few entities? What's to stop this from happening as long as on-chain scaling is not a priority?

No FUD, this is a serious question and want to understand the economics at play for BTC. Thanks!",1533785456,09/08/2018 03:30:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95syj7/economic_question_re_offchain_scaling/,1

Bitcoin is in the best place it has ever been.,"1. The scaling issues &amp; debate, as well as the related damaging forks are now largely behind us. Even before it blew up last year, it was the elephant in the room that needed to be addressed.
2. It is pretty clear that most governments &amp; regulators are taking a not-too-aggressive position. This was probably the biggest fear of the early adopters.
3. The next halving is due in 2020. This will reduce supply.
4. Goldman Sachs' custody service when launched will increase demand.
5. ICE/Starbucks/Microsoft plans will increase demand when implemented.
6. The SEC is more likely than ever to approve an ETF within the next 9 months. This will vastly increase demand.",1533790675,09/08/2018 04:57:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95ti7o/bitcoin_is_in_the_best_place_it_has_ever_been/,1
From year 2100 to 2140 *ONE* bitcoin will be mined total,"In year 2136 the bounty will be 0.00000042 BTC per block.

So now think how expensive those 40 years of mining will be, including tx fees; how much $$$ would running the current hashrate for 40 years cost? That would get you 1 bitcoin.

Cutting out all the speculation and absurd pumping and dumping to smokescreen the core idea that the cost to mine 1 bitcoin is a fair indicator of what 1 bitcoin's minimum value is, it becomes clear that the absolute minimum value is capable of being a massive multiple of what it is now, even if nobody spent or sold one.

BTC, or any crypto, floors at the cost to mine one: a conversion from electricity and infrastructure into ""value tokens.""

If it costs me $1,000 to mine one, I would never sell it for less than $1,000. And then eventually it costs more than that, and so on.

It is then a store of that expense. A token of that value. ""Using it"" is simply having it... mined or purchased.


Adoption involves the fluidity of conversion and outlets of acceptance, sure, but essentially stating that the value will ""never go up"" is stating that cost of mining or hashrate will also ""never go up."" Both have gone up steadily.

If you'd like to see the bubbles happening, look no further than the cost of mining vs the cost of bitcoin. Notice how it has never dropped under mid-scale mining costs, ever, in the history of BTC.

Notice how 1/2 of all bitcoin was mined at or under a $50 valuation, when a couple hundred dollar ASIC could turn profit in a few months.

100% of strategies of diversifying or averaging were pointless since then, the most successful strategy was to convert as much fiat (via cash or mining resources, whichever is more efficient for you) to BTC.

Right now estimates sre that it is around $5-6k to mine one bitcoin, and since hearing that figure the hashrate has jumped up ~15%. 

So unless you think the hashrate will double with the cost of mining halving, that means the baseline will follow suit to a substantial degree.

So, yeah, some real advice? Don't pay more than a couple percent over the cost of mining for 1 btc unless you're prepared to wait.

I just finished reading The Bitcoin Standard. These are my thoughts.,"When I started investing in cryptocurrency I didn't understand anything about it as I am not extremely good with computers and I have zero knowledge about coding. 

I initially invested as I assume most do and that was to make a quick profit. However the more I studied blockchain technology the more I started to understand it, and it kept leading me back to Bitcoin. Once I had read the whitepaper a few times I was down the rabbit hole and was consumed with understanding it.

What followed were months of trying to understand all the ins and outs of Bitcoin without having a solid understanding of cryptography. I gained knowledge but everything was still above my head when it came to the intricate details. It was then that I heard about the book The Bitcoin Standard. 

The book is absolutely perfect for anyone who is mildly interested in Bitcoin, it begins with teaching you how to understand money, what was first used for money and why that certain form of money either succeeded or failed.

It then dives into economics, the two different kinds and why they are both fundamentally wrong, the amount of detail in these chapters is so easy to understand and leaves you with a solid understanding of why empires succeeded or were destroyed.

It then submerges into the history of Bitcoin, who created it, and how it was created. It simply explains to you how everything is linked together from the miners to the nodes, to the average user like you and me.  Every concept is easy to grasp and leaves you with a solid understanding about all of it.

In conclusion; this masterpiece will have you questioning economics to their very core, wondering how and why we have accepted our form of money up to this point. The book will blow your mind about what money is, and it will make you understand why more and more people everyday still want to hold and use Bitcoin. 

The Bitcoin Standard is a must read if you're a crypto enthusiast.

Crypto Price Prediction System Developed by Yale Economists,"Yale University financial experts have outlined a basic strategy for identifying the best buying opportunities for some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Yale economics professor Aleh Tsyvinski and economics Ph.D. candidate Yukun Liu, have studied the historical price trends of [Bitcoin](https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/btc-usd) (BTC), [Ripple](https://www.investing.com/crypto/ripple/xrp-usd) (XRP) and [Ethereum](https://www.investing.com/crypto/ethereum/eth-usd)(ETH). The BTC data was tracked between 2011 and 2018, while the XRP and ETH performance was analyzed since their inception in 2012 and 2015, respectively. The economists described their findings in a [report](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24877) titled “Risks and Returns of Cryptocurrency”, published on Monday.

Tsyvinski and Liu say in the paper that cryptocurrencies have “low exposure” to traditional asset classes, such as stock, currencies and commodities. The research also calls into question popular explanations that supply factors such as mining costs, price-to-dividend ratio, or realized volatility are useful for predicting the behavior of cryptocurrency ret...

No Electrum wallet for iOS?,"So I keep the majority of my bitcoin on an Electrum wallet that I created on an Tails installation.

How do you monitor state of your bitcoind node?,"Hello,

Recently I have installed bitcoind on my local machine, was running it in testnet for a while, and was interested how can I monitor it's state (last block, if the node in sync with blockchain, what load on server it creates, etc.) besides making calls via bitcoin-cli manually but using some web UI instead. I found some open source tools to do that, for example this one - [**https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi**](https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi), which uses grafana to display data in graphs.

Do you know other ways to monitor state of the node in more graceful manner (without all cli commands)?

Technical question - 1 vs 6 vs 4000 confirmations,"I'm a long time BTC enthusiast and user. I am technical, but not a developer or technical enough to truly understand the preferences that certain services or wallets have for a specific number of confirmations.

How exactly is it possible for a transaction to obtain 1 confirmation before being rejected by the network? What's fundamentally different about 1 confirmation vs 6?

My understanding is that nodes are constantly checking transactions in the mempool ro validate their authenticity, even between blocks. I am looking to better understand the network sequence of events to understand why 1 confirmation is meaningfully less reliable than 2 or 6 or 4000 confirmations.

To all those of you selling this it what it takes to get a lambo.,"Remember seeing charts of bitcoin crashing and so many people saying ""Oh man I wish I bought there.""  Well now is your chance see its not so easy is it. I understand that anything above 19k seems impossible most of us just wanna break even. And there's no guarantee bitcoin will recover anytime soon or at all. If It does it might take 3-4 years before that happens. Who knows but I'm willing to hold on. 

I don't know if I'm a genius or a retard for buying a few hundred dollars worth of crypto every month. But if bitcoin were to recover one day and smash through 19k with ease. We will have insane returns. And this is what it takes to get a lambo, this is where we buy.",1533837336,09/08/2018 17:55:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95yr1d/to_all_those_of_you_selling_this_it_what_it_takes/,1

Plausible deniability account issues with Ledger Live Nano S hardware wallet. Very concerning.,"Sorry guys, this is not another meme about price and speculation on where bitcoin's price is gonna be tomorrow. This is about a device, a hardware wallet, that we have trusted for years and potentially has a big flaw that everyone should be aware of. This is about Ledger Nano S.

So I just installed Ledger Live (I used to use Chome app) and saw that my balances with Plausible Deniability account (which has an additional passphrase associated with it and a different pin code to access it on device) synced with the Live account even though I entered the pin for my default account. This is a VERY CONCERNING issue if you think about a couple of things:

What's the freaking point of plausible deniability if someone can see all my balances by connecting my Ledger device to a computer and using a default pin code?
Also, now I'm concerned about how my plausible deniability account is protected since I didn't even have to enter my pin for that account or the extra passphrase that I was supposed to enter to access the funds. How is this secure? This blows all my confidence on Ledger out of water.
Does anyone know if Trezor has this issue as well? I am seriously considering Trezor after this fiasco by Ledger.
I have posted this on /r/ledgerwallet as well and hopefully someone will get back to me with a good explanation.",1533837797,09/08/2018 18:03:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95ytmx/plausible_deniability_account_issues_with_ledger/,1

Private key is 64 characters long. Base32 is 52, not including the equals sign on the end. The QR code contains the Base 32 key only.

The Base32 key is not a simple Base 32 encryption of the Private key as you'd find here: [https://simplycalc.com](https://simplycalc.com). That's where I am left confused.

A network attack happens at this moment, putting fees really high. 

Alice decides to cheat thanks to an older state (when she had 0.9BTC) and broadcast the transaction. Millions of channels do the same and broadcast an obsolete state.

Now the cheated users have to broadcast the last state to get their money. Millions of people try to do that but the network is congested and a big part of them won't be able to close the channel before the timeout.

Am I misunderstanding something or is this a possible issue ?",1533844071,09/08/2018 19:47:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/95zrkd/lightning_network_possible_attack_issue/,1

The most effective ways to earn money on crypto currency in 2018,"When comparing the reality of the present time with the realities of two years ago, we can conclude that earning a crypt became more difficult.

https://i.redd.it/0mh0tjfom4f11.jpg

What is the reason for this?

Of course, with the increase in the popularity of such earnings, and subsequently with increased competition in this market. Brokers have to invent more and more ways of earning money on the cryptocurrency, realizing that the crypto currency itself assumes a certain risk. And that's why we have specially selected for you **the most effective ways** of making profit using the crypto currency and divided them into two categories: **earnings with risk or earnings without risk.**

Earnings on crypt with risk

**Trading**

Sufficiently up-to-date way of earning, but very risky, especially for beginners. The coins of digital coins can change and therefore this feature attracts the attention of many traders. The task of traders is to predict the position of the curve, it is worth noting that the fall in the rate as well as take-off can bring profit.

https://i.redd.it/jua44vpbn4f11.jpg

The essence of the method

The work of a currency trader consists in the analysis of market information, the creation on its basis of forecasts and the choice of the optimal moment for the transaction.

In trading, the same market laws and principles apply: supply and demand. It is they who move the prices of trading tools. That gives us opportunities for purchases and sales.

 It should be very serious about the commission for the withdrawal of coins and carefully choose the stock exchanges themselves, because there are active scammers.

 The specificity and approach to trading lies in the following stages:

* Forecast

The trader starts with the fact that he is trying to forecast a realistic forecast about what kind of coin can grow or vice versa to fall in price in the foreseeable future.

* Entrance

It is necessary to carefully study the dynamics of fluctuations in the value of the crypto currency and determine the moment when the coin is bought at a bargain price on the threshold of its growth.

* Exit

At this stage, the trader's task is to correctly determine when the coin value will go down and hold a profitable deal.

**2. To become the director of the exchanger**

It’s important to understand that you should have some amount of bitcoins in the usual money and that you have to conduct serious preparatory work.

The essence of the method

https://i.redd.it/b09byvpbn4f11.gif

The market of exchange resources is really very competitive and you will have to collect your client base long and painfully, at the risk of failing. You will encounter the need to open accounts, rent a server and also have to spend on advertising and promotion of your exchanger. But if you succeed, you will be able to observe how your wallet becomes more and more every day.

Earnings of the exchanger consists of a commission, usually this figure looks like 1-5%. A lot depends on the competition, as already mentioned above. People will seek the most profitable course in order to exchange money for the crypt or vice versa. Your task will be to monitor the exchange rate that is currently on the market and to indicate your exchange rate is the most profitable than that of others.

Exchange offices are working with users 24/7, points out that if your exchanger makes an automatic exchange, you will most likely have more customers.

Also, you should pay attention to the stock of assets (your reserve) for the exchange. For many users, this is one of the priority factors, so the more assets you have, the more transactions you will make, and thus increase your profits.

There are two ways to open a private exchange office:

https://i.redd.it/0ilrinpbn4f11.jpg

* Writing an exchange office code

Obviously, you need a qualified programmer who understands how the cryptocurrency market functions.As for the cost, then this development will be expensive and most likely will take a long time. But you will get an original exchange with your designs, a system that meets all your needs.

* Purchase of a template exchange office
* It is worth noting that its cost will be much less about $ 5000, but you will get a typical design (which users will be sure to note). This exchanger will not have the flexibility, since you will not have to change the script yourself. At the crypto community forums, you can find and buy a ready-made script. We agree that the second way is much shorter, but the choice is only for you.

**3. Investing in ICO**

ICO is a platform for attracting initial investment of a crypt into a new project. Many companies, start-ups, enter the ICO. Your task from all this set to be able to recognize promising projects. It depends on this depends on whether your investment will pay off or not. Also in this industry there is a chance to run into scammers so you need to carefully analyze the project in which you are going to invest your money.

https://i.redd.it/13qjmaqbn4f11.jpg

The essence of the method

  You need to create a purse, you can use the MyEtherWallet service.

For investment, you need to have a cryptocurrency, usually all projects are Bitcoin, Ethereum.

After this, you can start investing. You need to find the right service and make a transaction, then a certain number of tokens will be listed on your wallet. The transfer time may take some time.

4. Purchase and storage of cryptocurrency

The easiest way to get it. But still you can meet some difficulties. Since you can buy it only in specialized exchangers, a crypto exchange or using a purse in WebMoney (WMX).

**The essence of the method**

As already mentioned above, you start an electronic wallet or you will need to register one of the many systems for storing cryptocurrency. Next, you buy a crypt and safely forget about it and hope that it will grow in price.

Earnings on the crypt without risks.

**1. Arbitration**

https://i.redd.it/kf55a2qbn4f11.jpg

So, it was the turn of the safest, in our opinion, way to quickly earn on the difference in the value of the crypto currency.

For arbitration, more and more often they start using bots, there are two types:

* automatic - looks for holes in the price difference of the crypts on the exchanges and commits all transactions automatically.
* manual - is looking for holes on the stock exchanges with various algorithms and notifies you about it, but the decision to complete the transaction is provided to you, this is a completely new and modern way of earning in arbitration, an example of such a bot is [Bibitbot](https://www.bibitbot.com/).

The essence of the method

https://i.redd.it/trhkhupbn4f11.jpg

There are many exchanges on the market that offer different prices for the digital currency. The task of the user is to use the fluctuations in the value of the coins in his favor, that is, to buy on one exchange and sell on another more expensive. Plus this method consists in an easy algorithm and minimization of risks.

**2 Mining Cryptocurrency**

https://i.redd.it/fl411wpbn4f11.jpg

The popularity of this type of earnings can be seen in Russia in 2017, and so many have heard of the mining.

The essence of the method

In essence, mining is the generation of new coins in various cryptocurrencies. That is, a search for a specific sequence of numbers that would correspond to the specified parameters. Also this method is called hashing.

What you finally get is new blocks that are connected to a chain. Each chain consists of a transaction.

Over time, mining only becomes more complex and, therefore, requires much more powerful hardware.

There are 2 ways

* using a PC

You need: a PC with a powerful video card, Internet 9 speed is small, but constant), a cryptocurrency purse (to create easily), certain programs (there is a software that is configured only for a certain coin, and there are universal ones like NiceHash Miner and to take care of the hardware status, in particular the temperature parameter, for example MSI Afretburner. The earnings are small.

* special farm

One farm consists of a motherboard with a lot of connectors, a high-power power unit, 5-6 video cards and a good cooling system. Many people purchase special ASIC equipment.

According to statistics, the average payback of equipment takes 10-12 months.

# 3 Airdrop

https://i.redd.it/yapi5upbn4f11.png

One of the most effective ways to get an instant FREE crypto currency.

The essence of the method

It is worth knowing that you will not be able to get tokens much, but Airdrop is spent very much, and to participate simultaneously in many of them nobody forbids. The main thing is to have a purse.

To earn, it is enough to register on the site or contact representatives of Bitcointalk Next, you specify your email address, purse address.

To keep up-to-date with the current Airdrop Crypto-currency, you can subscribe to the Vk group ""Free tokens"", also you can get this information in the Bitcointalk and Quora and Reddit branches, and pay attention to the Twitter accounts b Telegram.

Airdrop is really free crypto currency, which is given on the following terms:

1)  on the terms of advertising - the service developers give free coins to those who wish, but in return they are asked to register on their service. For example: the user only needs to register his account in a particular project, then retweeting on his Twitter.

2) informing about the token that - when developers charge bonuses in the amount of 10-15% of the amount or in order to convey information to potential investors.

# 4.Bounty

*Processing img lcfxzvpbn4f11...*

This term means the free receipt of a limited number of coins or tokens during the ICO period.

ICO is the period of the initial collection of investment funds in order to advertise its project to create a new cryptocurrency.

The essence of the method

You can get coins for activity or for some other merit before the developers. It is obvious that after the SUCCESS start of the service, these coins will become real money, and in time can rise in price.

Bounty earnings: You perform activities according to the rules of the bounty and get a reward.

For participation you can get on average $ 100-1000

You can find promising bails of cryptocurrency on the branches Bitcointalk

For what you can get long-awaited coins

* advertising in social. networks
* video reviews of the project
* troubleshooting, bugs
* development, design of the project site
* application development, etc.
* email newsletter

**5 Sell services and goods for cryptocurrency**

Quite an obvious way to sell the cryptocurrency for your products or services.

https://i.redd.it/q2nk2ypbn4f11.jpg

The essence of the method

There are many cases when the employer or the customer pays for your work. The difficulty lies in the fact that it is necessary to work out the conversion of the output to the crypto currency in Fiat. In the future, you can observe the growth of the crypt and compensate for the funds that you spent on the commission and eventually increase your wallet.",1533847207,09/08/2018 20:40:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9608g5/the_most_effective_ways_to_earn_money_on_crypto/,1

This is why a bitcoin ETF is important,"I am likely to get flamed for this, but here goes. A lot people around here oppose an ETF because they feel that bitcoin was created to compete with the legacy financial system, and resent the entry of institutions. However I think they are missing a few points;

1. Probably more than anything else, volatility is what is holding back adoption for retail and for personal transactions. The injection of institutional level funds is exactly what is required to reduce the volatility. Yes, it may well mean a much higher bitcoin price, but with that will come a reduction in volatility.
2. In practical terms, physical ETFs - ie those backed by bitcoin (like the Solid X proposal), are not much different than buying real bitcoin - yes I know ""not my keys keys = not my bitcoin"", but for many people who can't even manage to backup their photo album, an ETF is the only viable way to to take advantage of bitcoin's ability to protect from failures of the  legacy financial system.
3. An ETF traded on a significant US exchange can be traded EXACTLY like a US stock. This means that it can be bought and sold worldwide through standard brokers, and as a result put into tax sheltered retirement plans such as 401ks in the US, RRSPs or TFSAs in Canada, or SIPs in the UK to name but a few. 
4. Regulated entities - including new fintech startups will have much less difficulty working with a regulated ETF.
5. A regulated ETF will go a very long way in making bitcoin respectable, and thus pave the way for mass adoption.
6. ETFs exist for practically all other financial assets and commodities. Blocking an ETF is like trying to stop a rising tide, so it will happen. The only question is at what point is the market mature enough for the regulators to feel comfortable.",1533854221,09/08/2018 22:37:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9618d8/this_is_why_a_bitcoin_etf_is_important/,1

New Lightning project: lightningpixels.com,"Hi! I'm Malcolm Rose and I run [RoseCrypto](https://rosecrypto.com), an educational site about Bitcoin. I decided to teach myself about the Lightning network by creating a project that uses it. Thus, I've developed a Reddit ""Place"" clone by modifying the open source code from pxls space. Basically this is an online canvas where you can spend one satoshi via the lightning network to paint one pixel.

I found out that a project like this already exists, but I was halfway through coding this and figured I'd go ahead and finish. There are some differences, of course - check them out for yourself.

Some more notes:

1) This is currently running on testnet, not mainnet. That means you can use something like htlc.me to paint for free for now. Think of it as an incentive to learning a bit about LN. I will be switching over to mainnet in a little while - maybe a week - and writing some articles/tutorials on RoseCrypto with some more information on how to get started.

2) The lightning team's community resources were pretty useful for getting started with this. [This page](https://lightning.community/lnd/faucet/2017/01/19/lightning-network-faucet/) had almost everything I needed to get started, albeit with [some minor hiccups](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightninglabs.github.io/pull/6) that I'm hoping I can help get resolved.

3) This thing is basically held together with sticks and glue. Expect it to be buggy, barebones, and prone to crash for awhile as I work out the kinks. In particular I haven't been able to figure out why lnd just sort of stops accepting transactions after awhile. Maybe roasbeef or somebody more knowledgeable about LN can come to my rescue on this.

4) Invoices are currently set to 500 satoshis by default, but you can send less or more and the system will (should?) pick up on this and credit your account. I did this because htlc.me doesn't seem to be able to support setting your own payment amount yet, and it's the easiest (I think) way to use the LN testnet right now.

Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to contact me here or [elsewhere](https://rosecrypto.com/Contact) if you have any comments or concerns!",1533868284,10/08/2018 02:31:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9630er/new_lightning_project_lightningpixelscom/,1

Google Search Can Predict Bitcoin Price Increases - Coinness,"A recent study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) suggests that **cryptocurrency markets move depending on the type of attention they receive**. This study incorporates data from consumer activity on search forums such as Google and social media sites such as Twitter. It found that a standard deviation increase in searches for keywords such as ""bitcoin"" **forecasted a small increase in the token's price in the following weeks.**  

On average, a single standard deviation increase in the keyword search lead to a 2.75 percent price increase, according to the report. Similarly, a standard deviation increase in Twitter post counts resulted in a 2.5 percent increase in bitcoin's price. On the other hand, a standard deviation increase in the terms ""bitcoin hack"" forecasted a small decrease in bitcoin's price.

Hypothetical question regarding difficulty adjustment.,"The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (roughly 2 weeks).   What happens if the price of bitcoin plummets and a significant % of hashrate was lost due to miners not finding it profitable?  Could it take forever to mine the needed 2016 blocks for adjustment to fix the issue?   

So I guess my questions are:

What percentage of hashrate would bitcoin need to lose to become a major problem?   Could this even happen?

Thai police have detained 27-year old actor Jiratpisit ""Boom"" Jaravijit in an alleged $24 million cryptocurrency scam, Bangkok Post reported August 9.

Jiratpisit is reportedly one of the seven suspects in the alleged crime, including his older brother and sister. On July 26, the Criminal Court awarded a warrant for his arrest following a complaint from a Finnish man that he had fraudulently lured foreigners into investing 797 million baht (nearly $24 million) worth of cryptocurrencies. Jiratpisit has been detained on charges of money-laundering activity, which he denies.

What if there is a stock market crash?,"Disclaimer: I promise this post isn’t going to be about bitcoin or its exchange rate with any fiat currency.

Of late, I have been thinking about a potential recession. It isn’t a question of ‘if’. In my opinion, it is just a matter of ‘when’.

With student loans, personal debt, automobile debt being at an all time high, a massive correction or a bubble exploding is just bound to happen. 

However, these massive corrections are quite common. Several of them have happened in the past and we recovered from it in one way or the other. 

I think the next one is going to be very worrisome. Almost all the major economies of the world did implement quantitative easing of varying magnitudes. A lot of the global currencies are much weaker than what they are today. Unfortunately, I see QE as a one time trump card. You can play it once and the damage will be minimal. Play it multiple times, the results can be catastrophic. 

This makes me think that some point of time almost all the currencies will lose value at a much faster pace. Turkish Lira, Argentinian Peso are only a few early examples. Major currencies will start hurting is my hypothesis.

I don’t have a crystal ball  (🔮) to guess what is going to happen. The arrival of Bitcoin is just almost miraculous. 

The words that Taleb wrote as a foreword to Saifedean’s book still makes me wonder. Bitcoin can be a very powerful way to keep central banks under a tight leash.

I’ve been in this space for quite some time now. Every time I think about the impact of this, I’m just amazed as to how impactful Bitcoin can be!

Wall Street has 2 years to mess with us...,"1 year is an eternity in crypto land. I’ve invested in the stock market for a decade and one year in crypto has been more exciting and excruciating than the past 10 years in traditional markets combined. 

Wall Street is old veteran money. These guys aren’t dummies. They got all the money in the world. They have political power. And time is on their side for now. You can see how much sway they have manipulating prices and releasing FUD in the media. They’re just getting started. 

Most millennials got into this game hoping for a get rich quick scheme. The truth is very few of us have a substantive understanding of what this is beyond a cover letter of knowledge, myself included. I work in tech, admittedly I’m not the genius in the room. But I’ve been voraciously consuming bitcoin content for a year and a half and I recognize I have so many blind spots in knowledge just to try and figure out all the ways this can play out for the best or worst. 

In my experience most of my fellow millennials don’t really have the stomach or the pocketbook to fend off a long siege if Wall Street decides to put it on us. I’d like to see us HODL it out but everyone has a breaking point. I know enough grown folk to know those in power are there because they are patient, organized, and have seen a whole lotta shit in their lives. 

You remember Occupy Wall Street? Quite a large movement. Powerful in the moment. Lots of genuine anger and passion from us fighting the dominant old guards reckless abuse of power. But guess what, didn’t really leave much of a mark in hindsight beyond making the cover of Newsweek. 

Here is what i see today, Wall Street is sowing fear and doubt throughout the media, rattling cages and scaring the crap out of us. Like lions circling the herd of water buffalos picking us off one at a time. And a lot of us don’t have it in us to hang in the pocket. Hopefully I’m proved wrong. 

But in my experience we millennials aren’t patient, we aren’t experienced, we very loosely organized and we aren’t disciplined. And i know a lot of people in crypto. Most of whom still leave their holdings in an exchange. 

In many ways it should fall a lot more in order for the tough lessons to sink in. That’s how life typically works. There’s a lot we all have to learn and most people are not putting on a jersey and getting in the game. We’re cheering or booing on the sidelines waiting for our team to score. 

Honestly, how many people know someone who is contributing code to any meaningful crypto project? 

I’m long because I see a bright future. How long that takes is anyone’s guess. But I can see things remaining turbulent for another agonizing year or two before any sun shines. Please convince me otherwise. ",1533880478,10/08/2018 05:54:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/964bu8/wall_street_has_2_years_to_mess_with_us/,1

We shouldn't wait for a perfect crypto currency,"People are too keen on visualizing some ideal future of the crypto world. This may be embedded into our history – the world was created by mathematicians. This is now the main obstacle on the way of cryptocurrencies substituting fiat money – mathematicians believe they can predict people’s actions. Here is an example.    
   
There was a comment at BitcoinTalk on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8v3agv/hodlers_will_not_change_the_world/). The post is about using cryptocurrencies as we use ordinary fiat money and make crypto a real payment method. The comment says that **crypto is not ready for it just yet**.   
   
I will give a long response to this objection. People, stop searching for flaws in the existing cryptocurrencies! They are all just a theory that has nothing to do with reality whatsoever. Here is a real story for you:   
There are turntables sold on our marketplace. So, a woman decides to buy her husband a turntable and remembers that at some point in her life she has bought a biocoin. Biocoin is not a common token and it has not become popular yet. Nevertheless, it is quite stable. The project is not a scam, it just quietly develops at its own pace.     
As the woman does not have much money, she decides to pay for the turntable in biocoins. The seller is more competent, so he knows everything: how to exchange boicoins for more common currencies and what possible reasons to hold biocoins exist. The woman does not see that biocoins are promising in the long term, while the seller does. Anyway, the deal is done, both parties are happy and no one thinks that cryptocurrencies are not ready to function as fiat money.   
   
You might say that was just a coincidence. Forgive me, but these coincidences add up to a sufficient number of transactions performed on our marketplace. Sure, eBay does more transactions than we do. But you know what? Even Amazon had only a dozen closed deals a day when it had first entered the market because online purchases were a rare thing, a novelty back then. There were people who bought goods online just for the fun of it.   
   
The thing is that even the relatively small number of deals on the platform gives our team energy and strength to move forward. All these stories inspire us to improve the marketplace. If our team was trying to create a perfect currency or a perfect marketplace, we would probably just stop as we would have no energy to keep going. Small stories of success can inspire us, while the ideal world can’t – it is just an illusion, a hallucination about ‘how it could be’. You don’t have to be perfect because ‘perfect’ is not the same for everyone. We all have different ideals. And the woman from our story is already happy with the way things turned out.   ",1533888064,10/08/2018 08:01:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96510u/we_shouldnt_wait_for_a_perfect_crypto_currency/,1
Trying to understand virtual mining,"Hi,

I'm taking this [course on Bitcoin](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency/lecture/UAFGS/proof-of-stake-virtual-mining) and just finished the video on virtual mining. What I don't understand is how this would work without doing the hard proof-of-work. Without POW wouldn't it be too easy for anyone to write to the blockchain? Or does virtual mining assume that the rest of the bitcoin network still operates on POW and virtual mining is more of an extension?

Enigma Protocol Enables Secure Whistleblowing Markets,"[Here is a link to the original article in HubPages](https://hubpages.com/politics/Enigma-Streamlines-Anonymous-Whistleblowing)

**Exhibit A**

On July 12, 2007, at 10:44 EST, a video, later released by Wikileaks, was recorded. ""[Collateral Murder](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Collateral_Murder,_5_Apr_2010)"", as it was called, was an exposé of indiscriminate airstrikes by two U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopters on eighteen civilians, in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad in Iraq, ten of which were standing and talking in a public square. Among those killed were Reuters journalist Namir Noor-Eldeen, and driver Saeed Chmagh. There were also some adults and children in a van, which stopped to help - who were shot as well. The two children in the van were seriously injured.

Later tanks arrived at the scene and soldiers joked over their radios that they were driving over dead bodies.

The soldier who had enough of a conscience to release the video, [Bradley Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning), was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment - including the torture of solitary confinement -, reduction in rank, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. Fortunately, Manning was eventually pardoned by President Obama at the end of his presidency, and released - after nearly ten years of captivity.

Incidentally, I had a trailer of [my book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1453712690/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) quietly removed from YouTube without explanation, likely because it included some segments from the video. After several inquiries, I have, as of yet, not been offered a single response or explanation of any kind.

While it is now almost universally accepted that the Iraq war was unjustified, its casualties greatly exceed the number of deaths from the twin towers incident, which was the war's *[casus belli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli)*. The real motives for the war remain shrouded in mystery, as do the details surrounding the American Airlines security breach, and the [similarity of the collapse of the towers to a controlled demolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_controlled_demolition_conspiracy_theories). [Operation Himmler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Himmler), a similar false flag operation in Nazi Germany, as well as a miriad of modern real-world conspiracies, await detailed investigation, but are hindered due to the likely unpleasant fate of contemporary whistleblowers.

**Exhibit B**

On May 20, 2013, another conscientious whistleblower, who had just quit his job with the NSA, [Edward Joseph Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), disclosed, according to the Pentagon, around 1.7 million NSA documents, which provided definitive proof of massive, covert snooping on innocent American - and foreign - citizens. His revelation included the PRISM electronic data mining program. He had hoped that this incriminating information would bring about a Constitutional challenge.

But a month later, the U. S. Department of Justice charged Snowden with two counts of violating the [Espionage Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917) and theft of ""government property"", and the Department of State revoked his passport. Snowden was stuck in an airport in Russia for over a month, until Russia granted him temporary asylum.

Snowden is now stuck in Moscow, and is unlikely to be pardoned by any politician.

Although his actions have opened debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, ""national security"" and information privacy, Snowden is being punished for his dedication to human dignity and basic human rights.

**Exhibit C**

[Julian Paul Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange) founded WikiLeaks in 2006, and came to international attention in 2010, with the publication of Collateral Murder, the Afghanistan war logs, the Iraq war logs, CableGate, and a quarter of a million diplomatic cables in 2010, as well as the Guantánamo files in 2011. Like clockwork, the U S. federal government launched a criminal investigation as the flow of information increased.

Wikileaks publishes incriminating secret information, news leaks, and classified media from anonymous sources. By 2015, WikiLeaks published more than 10 million documents, described by Assange as ""a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents"".

Now a citizen of Ecuador, Assange has remained in its Embassy in London since he was granted asylum there in August 2012. Like Manning and Snowden, Assange is a captive - the fate of the modern big-time whistleblower.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Building Bulletproof Whistleblowing Markets
Aside from the fact that a bulletproof platform for whistleblowing needs to better address anonymity - particularly for those on the front lines, Wikileaks has some additional vulnerabilities that can also be resolved via [Enigma's Secret Stores protocol](https://enigma.co/protocol/):

1) Wikileaks is a human organization with a small paid staff and a few thousand volunteers. It could be disrupted. The organization is centralized to the extent that could enable its administration to be shut down. Smart contracts, in contrast, are inherently decentralized, peer-to-peer, and permanent.

2) There is an encrypted “insurance” file, the key to which could fit into Twitter messages, that would be released in the event that Assange is killed or Wikileaks stops functioning. If the key is released, then those decrypted files will reportedly be available instantaneously. The insurance file has reportedly been downloaded more than 100,000 times. There are more than 1,000 sites mirroring Wikileaks and its content. Wikileaks has made available downloadable files containing its entire archive of released materials to date.

Nevertheless, such a release could be prevented if the keyholder(s) disappear. The information contained in the release is temporal, and we must trust that it exists, and that the information would have an impact regardless of when it is released, &amp;c. In short, it relies too much on a human chain and technology that will, at some point, become obsolete.

3) Websites require a domain name, which is obtained through the domain name system (“DNS”), which is hierarchical. Information travels from root servers down to zones containing lower-level servers. A domain can stop working for a variety of reasons. It could be overloaded with traffic intentionally or unintentionally, causing breakdown.

4) Wikileaks has had to switch hosts due to pressure by U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman. This could happen again. Smart contracts, however, are unstoppable.

5) The means of collecting money, already difficult, could be made even more difficult. Smart contracts allow any digitized currency to be used. The Enigma protocol adds the required layer of anonymity.



It should be immediately apparent that those who achieve power through corruption would like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, whistleblowers often do not come forward because, as we have seen, their lives can be in danger. If these three conscientious individuals came forward against such dangers, imagine how many more will speak openly once the dangers are removed.

As long as witnesses to malicious acts are prevented from coming forward, corruption will reign supreme. Once exposed, the corrupt, and their systems of corruption will retreat.

Whistleblowing should be a constant enterprise with markets for such information adding incentives for providing much needed information. The bigger the conspiracy, the greater the reward for exposing it. Valuable information attracts a premium.

In a bounty system empowered by the Secret Stores protocol, funding parties will be anonymous, whistleblowers will be anonymous, and documentation can be readily reviewed - including evidence.

While some progress has been made over the last few years regarding anonymity in corporate whistleblowing, the leaker still must deal with fallible politicians. There is currently no guarantee that the human to which the incriminating evidence is reported does not have a vested interest in keeping the information concealed, or that the reporter is safe from harm. Over time, the probability that a malicious individual has access to the person's identity increases - particularly when the leak involves high level politics.

By using an automated and fully anonoymous smart contract, no human can ever see the identity of the reporter.

Having Secret Contracts in whistleblowing will, at a minimum, result in less corruption.

If implemented on a large scale, the Secret Store protocol will have the potential to topple tyrannies from small to large.

Shower thought... bitcoin prices swinging up and down for a business is not as bad as advertised.,"Let's assume 2 things:      
1) the price will not rise up(no more bull runs) anymore but still fluctuates.       
2) your business deals with small amounts of individual sales, example a small restuarant.(not a lambo or yacht dealer)      
      
If you were to accept bitcoin in this thought experiment you would not lose money even though the prices can fluctuate $100s of dollars per day because if you were to average out the days,  you dont lose or gain anything. The good days make up for the bad, and the bad days brings down the good ones to average everything out. ( assuming we take into onsiderations 1 and 2 above)

Contacting Square's Cash App when problems verifying ID,"I, like many, had problems with withdrawing BTC from Square's Cash App due to being unable to verify identity. I tried sending messages through the contact support link on their site and replying to ""There was an issue enabling Bitcoin Withdrawals for your account"" emails but never even got an auto generated email indicating I'd submitted request for assistance (which I did receive when submitting request for help with non-bitcoin related issues).

Then today their options for contacting support added the option to select By Phone. It has been unavailable most of the day due to high call volumes but periodically checked the page until I was finally able to select the option. I entered my phone number, selected ""transaction not listed"" and explained that I was unable to complete the ID verification after numerous attempts and received message they would call me within 30 minutes. Not long after, I received a call from customer support who verified some account details and told me she would forward the issue to the appropriate dept who would email me so they could do manual ID verification. I received that email within 10 minutes and replied with photo of front and back of my driver's license and selfie. About 1 hour after I emailed the required photos, I am now able to withdraw BTC using the Cash App.

Was this a bit of a pain? Yes BUT using Square's Cash App to buy/use Bitcoin is GREAT! It is so simple, has various funding options, has really great exchange rates and no fees, lets you buy and withdraw as soon as you create account (withdrawal after verifying ID) with following limits: Purchase $10,00 per week, Sell unlimited, Withdraw $2,000 per day and $5,000 per Week.

Here is the link to contact support: [https://cash.me/support#contact-support/BITCOIN\_WITHDRAWALS](https://cash.me/support#contact-support/BITCOIN_WITHDRAWALS)

Probably the most unpopular post here,"Okay so I'm gonna try to keep it short.

I'm all pro bitcoin and about holding it and waiting for the price to go up. But can we please stop promoting that as if that's what the purpose of BTC is. Bitcoin was made to be a currency and to be used as a currency not some get rich quick scheme, not something you never use.

I get the logic of, ""Hey it dropped back to 6K I'd rather wait until 8K and then use it"" but the only logic seems to be,""Hey let's hodl until the world ends""

If bitcoin isn't used then it's not gonna go anywhere, it's not going to gain any value because what the value in it? It's not a collectors item. 

I get a lot of people missed out on it when it was under a penny, when it was a couple bucks, a couple hubdred, even a thousand. But even if you have $500 in btc right now and it jumps up to 60K in the next 10 years you will have 5K. Yeah it's money, a good return but YOU WON'T BE A MILLIONAIRE.

Please stop spreading this nonsense around and let's all start trying to get people to use BTC in everyday lives. Talk to a local shop or business about the ease of use, the low transaction fees, and the control. Talk to others about USING it, not hoarding it waiting to make a million.

That's why the banks and other corporations are stepping in, that's why it's being treated like a stock/bond whatever, because no one is using the thing to buy stuff.

Probably the most unpopular post here II," Reality is that 99.98% of the population will ALWAYS and FOREVER use a Visa/Mastercard/Amex credit card for their daily purchasing transactions. Credit cards offer many features and benefits such as ease of use, consumer protections(ability to charge back, and fraud protection), cash back, frequent flyer miles, and many other types of rewards. The MOST important feature of the credit card is the ability to buy TENS of thousands of dollars worth of items with absolutely NO money, just credit. Crypto cannot do that. Banks are not going away for the simple reason that they offer account protections against theft. Protections that crypto cannot currently offer. Since the majority of people are lazy,lazy,lazy, and lazy and simply cannot handle the responsibilities of safeguarding their own wealth, nor do most of them want to look after the safety of their own wealth, crypto will never be for the masses.

\------&gt; HOWEVER &lt;------

BTC will flourish and dominate as Gold 2.0 / Store Of Value, all other alt coins will eventually wither away. BTC is the Anti-Inflationary Hedge. As non-stop fiat printing accelerates in the coming months and years(except perhaps the Swiss Franc) BTC will become the only stable currency on the globe.

\*\*\*\* I DO NOT CARE WHAT BTC WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR, quite often inventions that were designed for one purpose end up being used for a completely other purpose, and VERY SUCCESSFULLY I might add.

Can Bitcoin be this trade war's trojan horse,"I don’t think our president said weighed in on Bitcoin directly, yet true to form he has a tendency to take actions which creates outcomes he never meant to in the first place. While these trade wars rage on Bitcoin may have something to takeaway in this moment of country to country strife. Since it transcends countries it actually is incredibly neutral in these wars - everyone who partakes across all countries wins.

If these trade wars accelerate the demise of fiats like dominos, a potential Trojan Horse in the fray might just be Bitcoin adoption. I was surprised not to see an uptick from Iran's rial devaluation. Maybe it will have a lagging affect. Today with Turkey's Lira taking a dive I can imagine the citizens taking a good long hard look at Bitcoin at this very moment. Especially if their situation continues to erode. 

It's horrific to witness countries crumble but lets hope the offer of Bitcoin is accepted to free these citizens from demise and offer safe harbor.

### For the people who don’t know you, what can you tell about yourself?

I was originally a hardware design engineer, creating electronic memory systems for computers and a few consumer products. Later, I started a company that designed and manufactured local area network devices for the smart building controls industry.

Back at college, I studied hardware engineering, of course. But I was always fascinated with encryption, compression and error correction. I studied under **Gilles Brassard** (inventor of Quantum Cryptography), and I met **Claude Shannon** (the father of information theory) and **David Chaum** (founder of DigiCash). In the early days of email, I latched onto PGP, RSA and the public key infrastructure that enables internet commerce. I realized that these concepts would enable transformative products and services, and that they would radically benefit consumers.

Nine years ago, **Satoshi** hit the scene with a solution to the Double-Spend problem. In a very brief whitepaper, he articulated the blockchain and even introduced a test platform which used a blockchain as a distributed consensus mechanism for digital cash that required no central nexus or authoritative bookkeeper. He called it “**Bitcoin**”.

I was fortunate to appreciate the tectonic importance of Satoshi’s gift to mankind. The **blockchain** and **Bitcoin** are easily misunderstood or dismissed today, but they are no less important than the internet or public key cryptography. They will radically change how we work, play, spend money and how we interact with each other. Ultimately, they will redefine the relationship between citizens and their governments, because these concept allow us to redefine trust and democracy in a way that more closely matches our goals and ideals.

I was involved in cryptocurrency early on, even in the pre-PayPal days of DigiCash and Digital Gold.

**So, what do I do today?**

I co-chair the Cryptocurrency Standards Association, a loose-knit collaborative of researchers, journalists, enthusiasts and vendors. I host the New York Bitcoin Event and more recently, I am keynote speaker at Cryptocurrency Conferences. I also sit on the New Money Systems board at Lifeboat Foundation. I am a top Bitcoin writer at Quora and editor of the Blog, AWildDuck.com

### What is blockchain and, how does it work?

We hear a lot about the blockchain. We also hear a lot of misconceptions about its purpose and benefits. Some have said that it represents a threat to banks or to governments. Nonsense! It is time for a simple, non-political, and non-economic definition…

#### What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed approach to bookkeeping. Because it opens and distributes the ledger among all participants, it offers an empowering, efficient and trusted way for disparate parties to reach consensus. It is “empowering”, because conclusions built on a blockchain can be constructed in a way that is inherently fair, transparent and resistant to manipulation. At scale, it is also massively redundant. This further leads to a hardened network which can resist loss whether caused by accident, faulty infrastructure or attack.

This is why blockchain-backed systems are generating excitement. Implemented as distributed and permissionless, they take uncertainty out of accounting, voting, legislation or research, and replace it with trust and security. Benefits are bestowed without the need for central authority or arbitration. The blockchain not only solves a fundamental transaction challenge, it addresses communication and arbitration problems that have bedeviled thinkers since the ancient Egyptians.

### What is a cryptocurrency and, how does it work?

Cryptocurrency is a blockchain-based token that has achieved a two-sided network and is used like money in payment for goods, services or debts. It is not simply traded by investors, hoarders and speculators (although these trades dominate the early adoption phase) — and it is not simply used as an asset-backed payment instrument like a gift card or debit card. (Those are instruments are tied to dollars or the solvency of banks and retailers). Rather, a cryptocurrency is traded with the potential to be the money itself. It’s value floats freely with supply and demand.

It is important to distinguish cryptocurrency from ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and other digital tokens. Cryptocurrency always refers to Bitcoin or other altcoins that are built on an open source, transparent and permissionless blockchain. They have no proprietary code or features, and every transaction from the very start of time is open to public scrutiny.

A cryptocurrency might have a functional purpose like some ICOs (That is, they might be used for something other than a payment instrument). But they are never associated with Airdrops, multi-level trading, or promotions that generate benefits to early adopters or those who refer. These gimmicks never apply to genuine cryptocurrencies. They are concepts from the marketers who hawk ICOs. Those are digital products for speculators and not a cryptocurrency.

#### How do they work?

Cryptocurrencies work by permitting trust without any central authority keeping the books. Instead of a bank or retailer tracking your ownership of coins, a network of miners act as a giant network of distributed accounts. Their activity maintains the transaction logs, attests to the validity of transactions and keeps track of who owns what.

#### Here are some really interesting facts about miners:

**(a)** Anyone can be a miner. There are no restrictions on joining the party

**(b)** Eventually, everyone will be a miner, whether they realize it or not. That is, it will become a part of every wallet. The reason that everyone will become a miner, is because the rewards will eventually run out. When they do, the spread of mining to all parties is the glue that will keep transactions fast, free and trusted.

**(c)** Miners don’t “see” that they are writing, validating, publishing and guaranteeing validity of the books. From their perspective, they are participating in a massive networked gaming community. They race other gamers, trying to solve a math puzzle, while seeking little rewards as they go along.

### Do you see future where we will adopt cryptocurrencies at international scale and, why?

It is inevitable! Someday, Cryptocurrencies will replace government issued currencies. I am certain of this. Why is this? Because **Bitcoin** is not only good for consumers, vendors, banks, lenders, creditors and NGOs — it is especially good for governments.

Today, some legislators and politicians fear that cryptocurrency will undermine a country’s control over its own monetary policy. This is true. Indeed, governments will lose that control. And this is good.

A government no more needs control over monetary policy as it does over telecommunications or the package delivery services. We are conditioned to believe that value comes from a trusted party, and this makes it hard to give up our assumption that governments must control the creation of wealth. But, in fact, nations are much healthier if they must balance their books like any individual, business, NGO, club, state or municipality. They can still borrow, of course. But they will no longer be able to print funny money and continuously hoist their debts onto unborn generations.

### Why did bitcoin reach such a high value??

**Bitcoin** had a significant rise in 2017. From $1000 to almost $20,000 per BTC unit. During that time, the subject spread like wildfire — and so, of course did investor interest. News stories flourished and these led to functional studies by banks, vendors, exchanges, and settlement houses. But, more than 95% of trades were made by investors, day traders, hoarders and speculators, and this leads to a volatile commodity. (Not a bubble, but a very rapidly changing value). This exchange value makes for great dinner-table discussion. It also makes some very rich and poor traders. But, in the end, it is quite meaningless.

In the end, **1 BTC will always be worth 1 BTC**. When the exchange rate fluctuates relative to the dollar or some other currency, you will wonder what good or bad news affected the value of the dollar. You will not wonder about Bitcoin, because goods and services will be quoted and exchanged in Bitcoin, and the value to your household will not fluctuate rapidly.

### What is the best cryptocurrency out there and, why?

**Bitcoin** is the only viable long-term cryptocurrency. Others, like **Ethereum**, may survive or even flourish, but this is because they serve other markets, and are not trying to be simply money.

#### The reason that Bitcoin will not be dethroned as the future of money, is:

* *It has already achieved a ubiquitous two sided network in every country*
* *You may recall that VHS video format overtook the momentum of Betamax. But this won’t happen with Bitcoin. That’s because VHS and Betamax had competing proprietary technologies and each came with a minefield of licensing fees and requirements. Eventually, the market chose the one with the lowest cost and fewest encumbrances. Bit Bitcoin is different. It is free to steal any clever innovations demonstrated by altcoins and then add the features into Bitcoin itself. In this field, there are no proprietary ideas, licensing requirements or secrets.*

Developers that I work with view every altcoin as a beta test platform for Bitcoin. Any improvement, new feature or clever innovation can be backed into Bitcoin. It’s a messy exercise in democracy, but ultimate, it only requires that the new code is accepted by a majority of miners — or championed by rising user awareness.

### Do you think ETFs will be possible?

Sure. This will happen. Some government bodies will be against it and some will be for it. But either way, it is fait accompli. Eventually, every country will be dragged into the party. In any democracy or capitalist country, there is no reasonable basis for government or regulators to forbid citizens from creating securities out of any commodity or asset. Cryptocurrencies do not present any unique issues for brokers and traditional exchanges. They can be easily securitized or partitioned into derivatives. Sure, some of these instruments will amplify risk, but in the end, the public will create and market whatever instruments they wish.

### Do you think decentralization will be inevitable and, why?

Yes. Decentralization is inevitable, because it addresses the goal of fairness, accountability and capitalism. It has always been a viable solution, but without a mechanism to enable applications.

Trust built on decentralized consensus (especially money) creates a fair, transparent, fluid network. It keeps governments honest.

Contrary to early pundits, decentralized cryptocurrency does not lessen a government’s ability to tax, spend or enforce tax collection. Additionally, it does not facilitate crime. These are early myths from analysts who did not fully understand or appreciate the blockchain.

But, cryptocurrency will certainly change the social contract between a government, its citizens and its creditors. Walls will come tumbling down, and this benefits everyone.

### Do you think we are making history and, why?

Yes indeed. Just like the steam hammer, the telephone, the internal combustion engine, the transistor and the internet, our grandchildren will look back on the 20-teens and 2020s, and ask what it was like to witness a revolution is real time. The advent of cryptocurrency is a bit harder to grasp at first. But it is just as transformative; just as beneficial; just as important to our future.

### Can you name some of the projects who will have huge impact in society and, why?

Voting, Real estate (deeds, transfers, liens), contracts, multisig consensus (related to anything), peer review (in any field), medicine, genetics, law (adjudication &amp; arbitration), sports (scoring and consensus) — and hundreds of fields that we cannot yet imagine.

### What advice can you give to the people who are starting their own project on the blockchain?

Keep your eye on the fundamental things that make the blockchain credible and beneficial. That is, Be very skeptical of any implementation that is not:

* *permissionless*
* *open source*
* *without any licensing or legal restrictions*
* *fully accountable genesis period*
* *based on a trusted, recognized, vetted blockchain code with a lineage that is directly traceable to Satoshi’s 2009 whitepaper*
* *without the slightest hint of airdrops, MLM or referral fees, or any marketing behavior that smacks of these things*

If you are involved in a project that uses a new coin or token, ask yourself if the problem could be addressed by Bitcoin or Ethereum. If so, why bother with the new coin? It certainly cannot be as fair, transparent, vetted and scalable.

### Where should people start when they want to begin to learn how blockchain works?

* *Any novice should begin by using Google. Search blockchain introduction OR blockchain for beginners OR how does a blockchain work?*
* *Here is a list of blockchain courses, including Blockchain Basics. Many are online:* [*https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=blockchain*](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=blockchain)
* *In this article, I mention terrific table of free blockchain courses:* [*http://awildduck.com/?p=4846*](http://awildduck.com/?p=4846)

### What resources can you share with us, besides the ones that you already share?

I write a lot of articles about the revolution under our feet. With irreverent modesty, I refer you to my own articles:

• **WildDuck** I write under the pen name, “Ellery” \[[View articles](http://awildduck.com/?cat=80)\]

**• LinkedIn** Blockchain columnist: Dozens of [published articles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philraymond/detail/recent-activity/posts/). Additionally,

**• Lifeboat** Board member, Columnist \[[View articles](http://lifeboat.com/blog/author/phil-raymond)\]

**• Quora** Most active author Bitcoin &amp; blockchain \[[1000 articles](http://awildduck.com/quora) as “Ellery”\]

• **Sophos** Bitcoin wallet security \[[View article](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/01/23/bitcoin-wallets-how-to-protect-your-digital-currency/)\]

### What is the next milestone to the blockchain?

In the past few months, we have seen the gradual roll out of Lightning Network. It successfully addressed critical infrastructure problems associated with of transaction speed, cost, and other issues affecting scalability.

There are several minor issues to be addressed, mostly related to security, malleability, and testability. But I am most interested in two long term issues that must eventually be addressed:

#### 1. Energy Consumption Caused by Proof of Work

The blockchain is the engine of Bitcoin and all other fair cryptocurrencies. Currently, Bitcoin’s blockchain is based on a distributed consensus mechanism called Proof of Work \[POW\]. It is fair, but it is very expensive. If solar power and other cheap energy sources spread across the world, the economics of POW guarantee that all the new, inexpensive energy will be diverted into mining and will not free humanity from fossil fuels and massive cash payments across borders.

We must replace the current Proof-of-Work mechanism with one that does not suck up every available kilowatt. Currently, POW is the scalability elephant in the room. Other cryptocurrencies have introduced alternate consensus mechanisms, but, in my opinion, they are either centralized or unfair.

**Fortunately, other fair, distributed consensus mechanisms are on the horizon. You can read more about it here:**

* [*Distributed Consensus: Beyond POW or POS*](http://awildduck.com/?p=4663)
* [*Blockchain Scalability; Proof of Work –vs- BFT Replication*](http://awildduck.com/?p=4645)

#### 2. Dwindling of Mining Rewards and the Alignment of Goals

Every user must eventually become a miner. This will align the interests of stakeholders, incentive validators (what is now called miners), and enhance Satoshi’s vision of a fair, decentralized system of accounting and consensus.

### What motivates you?

I am very fortunate to have discovered a calling and a career that fires my passion in every way. I recognized the importance of the blockchain and Bitcoin very early, and as an amateur writer, I realized that I could dispel myths that were bound to arise. The biggest myths about cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, are:

* *It is a bubble — just like 16th century Tulip mania*
* *Nothing tangible backs it*
* *It facilitates criminal activity*
* *Governments won’t allow it*
* *It enables tax cheating*
* *It is deflationary, and this stifles economic growth (or leads to war, unemployment, recession, or planter’s warts!)*

Absolutely none of this is true. But it makes for great press and it leads to a state of fear, which helps to mislead the public. I try hard to counter such misunderstanding and irrational fear in my articles, presentations and consulting.

### What’s your definition of success?

#### Cryptocurrency transactions fall into two classes:

**1.** Transactions driven by money exchange or investment (speculators, hoarders, day traders)

**2**. Transactions driven by commerce (purchases, sales, debt settlement, staff salaries, interbank transfers, bonding shipments).

Today, the first category accounts for **95%** or more of all **Bitcoin** transactions.

The first stage of “success” will be the time at which the fraction of Bitcoin transactions in Category 2 exceeds those in Category one. This will be the day that Bitcoin stops fluctuating and becomes a serious economic instrument.

Later a 2nd success will arrive when citizens of the world begin to shift their accumulated wealth and credit from legacy, national currencies to Bitcoin.

### What you think of work/life balance?

With any career or project, there is always a risk of abandoning family responsibilities or the need to relax. I find my work to be both rewarding and relaxing (my career in cryptocurrencies and blockchain). But, I still spend more than half of my time with family and friends. For me, the balance is crucial to leading a fulfilling life.

Many of these friends are interested in the same things as me, and i always try to learn from those with different interests and skills.

### What is the best advice you can give to the people who are reading this?

Don’t get sucked into ICOs. They are scams

More about this:

**(a)** [Is every ICOs a scam?](http://awildduck.com/?p=5249)

**(b)** [ICOs &amp; altcoins rise and fall, but Bitcoin endures](http://awildduck.com/?p=5192)

* Don’t think of Bitcoin as just an investment. Accept it in business and avoid converting all revenues into fiat.
* Retain some cryptocurrency so that you can use it to purchase materials, pay staff and settle debts. Look for vendors that make it easy to pay with Bitcoin. Keep it circulating! If it does not achieve significantly more adoption (at least as a payment instrument — but more critically as a currency), then your nest egg will never provide you with security. Use it! Keep it circulating.

Bitcoin as a Long Term Investment,"I occasionally see posts that end with ""Buy bitcoin, your children and grandchildren will thank you!""

Please explain to me why Bitcoin is better than something like an aggressive mutual fund with low admin fees for this purpose?

To me, that mutual fund has a greater than 95% of growing into millions when you are aiming for long term investing.

Bitcoin has potential to outperform that mutual fund, but even if I give it a 50% of becoming big (which is generous imo), it is still not worth picking over the mutual fund.

Question about transaction broadcasting privacy.,"I have a question about how transactions are broadcasted and how that compromises privacy.

I don't know what it is called but it is when some node, or an ISP, is monitoring a full node you are running and you broadcast a transaction on your full node. For the snooping node/ISP, that can given them a clear indication that the transaction broadcasted from your full node is yours as they are not seeing it broadcasted from any other node on the network (yet)?

How can this be if nodes are always picked randomly to broadcast the transaction? Shouldn't the chance that a transaction appearing first from my node is actually my own transaction be the same as a random person's transaction appearing first on my own node?

"Bitmain and its IPO valued at respectively 50 and 18 billion $, compared to a bitcoin current market cap of 105 billion $","Does it make sense that the main mining hardware company is valued at about half of the total market capitalization of bitcoin? or about a quarter of the market capitalization of all cryptocoins?

Does it imply that Bitmain, through the mining reward process, has actually captured about 50% of the value of bitcoins in circulation ? or holds up to 50% of all bitcoins?

Or does it mean that future investors see a large upside potential in bitcoin value, necessary to support Bitmain business value ?

Or is it just a wild overestimation of Bitmain based on their latest profit figures, but not indicative of future performance ?

Just got scammed on xcoins/paypal and need help,"So bear with me, I'm at my wit's end over this and have no idea what to do.

I used xcoins to sell off a recently acquired amount of bitcoin. One buyer purchased a hefty some of it, and sent the money to my paypal. A couple of weeks later, I get notice from paypal that the buyer is disputing the purchase and saying he never authorized it. 

I go through the proper channels following Xcoins' support system and send paypal the .pdf file showing proof of purchase and transaction. I talk to paypal support and they tell me I should be fine but its' up to the buy's financial institution to make the decision. 

Shockingly, this morning I receive an email saying his financial institution has found in his favor. Paypal basically washes their hands of this and says all I can do is contact him for a resolution.

My paypal balance has already been deducted for the amount ""owed"" to him, and is now negative. I have received 0 of the bitcoin back. 

What the fuck is going on here? How can they so easily side with a scammer? If he didn't authorize the payment, shouldn't it be as simple as returning my bitcoin to me? Then I would have no problem sending him his money back. 

Is there anything else I can do? I'm really at a loss and very upset by this. I'm not a wealthy person and I need this money to pay my bills.

Is it possible to purchase Crypto with Bank of America bank transfer?,"Hi guys,

I'm relatively new here but I've been attempting to keep up with fast changing Crypto information by watching Andreas Antonopoulos and reading as much as I could.

I'm now ready to purchase some litecoin and etherium to start experimenting but I can't seem to find a way to do so without getting charged high fees.

I looked over the beginners sections and noticed that coinbase happens to be the best bet to purchase from my country (Belize) but coinbase then labels my country based on my IP address I assume then I can't purchase any crypto after that. 

Do you guys have any suggestions or can maybe offer a bit of direction. I'm so sorry if this is an ignorant question but I really do want to join the cryptoscene especially given the prices now. 

Thanks :)",1533996109,11/08/2018 14:01:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96gqz6/is_it_possible_to_purchase_crypto_with_bank_of/,1

"Question/Discussion about the future income for miners. Ie, Will the transactions fees be enough and affordable to have a functional blockchain?","Hi,

I was crunching some numbers and am curious what you guys think about this subject matter. 

At current time a bitcoin transaction fee is ~10cents. Each block can fit 2mb worth of transactions, which amounts to ~2200 transactions. And of course, the block reward is 12.5 bitcoin.

So, today miners are making $75000 from block reward + $220 in transactions fees. Today, it seems like the bitcoin blockchain will continue to be economical because there's enough financial incentive to keep miners all over the world to continue their work.

But, in the year 2140 (yes I am thinking that far ahead), we all know the last bitcoin will be mined and the network will hopefully be able to live off transaction fees. This is where I see an issue, if there can only be ~2200 transactions per block, each transaction would have to cost ~$34 (75220/2200=~34) to make it so the network is making the same amount of money as it is today. (

$34 per transaction seems pretty costly. Thoughts?

When somebody posts any kind of Technical Analysis here...,"Stop and think.

What is the purpose of TA?  To show us where the price has been lately?  No.  We can just look at a chart and see it - no analysis needed.  Is the purpose to tell us the current price?  No.  We can look at various ""tickers"" and see the current price - no analysis needed.  The purpose is to **predict near-term price changes.**  In other words, ""predict the future"".

What is the point of trying to predict the future?  To make money.

Can TA predict the future well enough to allow people to use it to make money?  Suppose it could, if you knew the right technique to employ.  Suppose you figure out such a technique, and it works reliably.  What are you going to do?  I can tell you, my heart would be pounding with excitement and the **last thing I would do about it** is tell anybody.  Certainly, I'm not going to go blab it onto the Internet!  Seriously!

The reality is this.  There is no such thing as TA which can reliably predict the future.  Nobody beats the overall market average over the long run.  ""*Extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor.""*

Here's a **second thing worth considering**.  Speaking of long run average... the value of Bitcoin has more than doubled per year, on average, long term.  I see no reason for this overall trend to end.  I do see reasons for it to continue, but that's a different topic for a different post.  

With returns like what we've been seeing, long term, who needs to predict tomorrow's price, or next week's price?  Idiots, that's who.  For Bitcoin investing, TA is useless, even IF it works.  If doubling your money every year isn't good enough for you, you're fucked up, and earning at an even higher rate isn't going to satisfy you -- your problems lie elsewhere.

If, on the other hand, doubling your net worth every year (on average) is good enough for you, then just **buy and hold Bitcoin** \- no analysis needed.  No risky trading.  No trading fees.

"Needing web apps, static websites or other type of software?","Hey guys, i used to be very, very active here, i even founded a project as a suggestion from a lot of you guys here, the project of which i'm talking about and from which you may remember me is http://helpvenezuelans.com that is now closed, though.

I come to post this as a web developer, sadly during those days a lot of people from here asked for my web development help but i was busy with the project i just mentioned so i had to pause all work related activities for a while, through that pause i lost contact with most of my past clients, so i'm looking to meet new clients whose life i can make easier =)

I've been freelancing through reddit for a couple of years now, i have had a great time, I have met so many amazing people which i have both worked with and worked for.

My number one priority is for my client to be as happy as possible and to do so i always make the complete scope of the project very clear, so the client knows exactly what she/he will get before she/he hires me/pays me. If my client is happy with my work, so am i! Anyway, here's my profile for anyone interested or in need of web development assistance:

**Skills:**

* Static websites: I can develop/create anything that you have in mind by using tools such as Javascript/Vue.js/React for interactions and Bootstrap/Foundation/ or pure HTML/CSS for markup and presentation.

* Web apps from scratch: I can also create full web apps from scratch, the difference between a static website and a web app is the level of functionality, for example, if you need to show information about your business, or collect data through a few forms but you don't need user registration, what you are looking to have is a static website, if you however want to have user registration and other functions for that it will be a web app, reddit, facebook and all websites like that are web applications, not static websites. For web apps my main tools are Ruby on rails and Django for the back end.

* Web apps on platforms such as wordpress: I can also work on your theme/website, develop a theme or develop a wordpress based website from the start.

* Scripts/bots/automation tools: If you need scrappers, programs to record and keep track of different types of data, or any desktop app that will automate any task at all i can do it with Python.

* Linux based server management: I can also manage your linux based server/vps, if something broke and you do not know how to fix it, i can look into what happened and fix it.

**Contact:**

You can contact me through here on a private message, i'll send you my portfolio, after reading all the details i need from you and asking you any questions i have i'll make you a proposal, and from there you decide if you'd like to hire me.

Guide to BitCoin Wallet Data Recovery/AMA,"After seeing a lot of dangerous advice on this sub about DIY ways of recovering Bitcoin, I wanted to write a guide to help other HODLers recover their wallets when their hard drives crash. This guide is mostly oriented towards conventional spinning disks but I have some tips for phones, SSDs, etc. I have been doing data recovery professionally for over 10 years at a firm that shall remain nameless, so I have a great amount of expertise in diagnosing and recovering from various media, operating systems, etc.


**BEFORE CONTINUING TO READ THIS GUIDE OR ATTEMPTING ANY DATA RECOVERY TURN OFF AND DISCONNECT THE DEVICE YOU WISH TO RECOVER DATA FROM. ANY FURTHER USE OF THE DEVICE GREATLY LESSENS THE CHANCE YOUR DATA WILL BE RECOVERABLE!**


**As a general disclaimer**: If you suspect or know your device is failing and you have Bitcoin or other valuable data on it, the safest route is to send your device to a data recovery lab that has the appropriate training and equipment to recover it. **Stop and think about how much your data is worth, or in the case of Bitcoin, how much you hope it will be worth one day. If it's worth paying a $300-$1500 to recover (or will be worth this in the future when you have more money), DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RECOVER IT YOURSELF.** I understand you are freaked out right now that your BTC may be lost forever, but you will make the best decision with a calm mind that takes its time to think through things. You may only get one chance at a successful recovery. Every time you do any attempts at DIY recovery, you lessen the chances that your data will be recoverable. This is especially true if you have a drive that failed directly after being dropped, is making clicking or grinding noises, or had liquid damage of any kind. Even spinning up a drive once for a few seconds that has a damaged head due to a drop can permanently destroy your data by literally scraping it off the platters. All that being said, if it's worth taking the risk, hopefully this guide can help you. I am providing this information without any warranty, if you lose all your data following my instructions, that's your own fault for not taking it to a professional. For many of the links referenced in here, I may have not tested the instructions fully. I have my own way of doing things in the shop which isn't written down and used much more advanced tools, so for any step which uses external instructions, try to read a few other guides as well to make sure you know what you're doing before you try doing it.


**Step 1: Diagnose your device**


The first step in recovering your data is determining the health of the device. 
* If you accidentally deleted your wallet or formatted your device but your device is in otherwise good health, you have a good chance of being able to recover your data. A professional recovery like this can run as low as $300.
* If your device stopped working (or got significantly less functional) directly after a fall and it is a conventional spinning disk drive, there is a good chance there is damage to the heads, platters, or both. A professional could recover data from this scenario for $600 to over $1,000 depending on the situation. Head swaps are complex enough that they're beyond the scope of this guide. I would suggest [this guide](http://hddsurgery.com/pdfs/samtshbfinal.pdf) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIPZtJyrVPw) which show how head swaps work in general and [this guide](https://www.donordrives.com/blog/matching-guide) for finding appropriate donor drives. Some drives you can find donors for by simply matching some information from the drive label on eBay, others require advanced equipment like a PC-3000. This is because some drives have specific information about them (microjogs etc) which you can't know unless you can access the drive's terminal and firmware. I implore you to send cases like this to a professional. I should add that while many places say you need a clean room if you open a drive, this is not the case. Clean rooms are great if your data is worth thousands of dollars and you can afford the clean room rate, but you can successfully run a drive after opening it without a clean room, some drives will even operate just fine, for hours, with the cover off. If a piece of dust or pollen gets in-between the drive heads and the drive platters (often this space is mere nanometers), it can rip the data off the platters. However, as drives spin they create an air pocket which can prevent such dust from landing on it. There is an element of risk in non-cleanroom recovery, and that risk is real, but it is not nearly as dire as some data recovery companies present it to be. If you don't believe me, take a hard drive you don't care about, open it, re-assemble it, and see if it works. It probably will, though some drives like WD may not because a screw in their case is needed to properly operate the actuator arm. And I wouldn't suggest continuing to use that drive for obvious reasons.
* If your device was damaged by water, you should dry out the device first as much as you can. Tricks like rice are dumb, all they do is prevent air from getting to your device and drying it out. Simply leaving your device out in the open air and time is all you need, though you can speed the process with some gentle heat. If you got your laptop, phone, or other enclosure wet, remove the data storage device from the enclosure itself. By gently cleaning the device with rubbing alcohol (99% or higher suggested) and a q-tip, you can arrest much of the corrosion and speed the drying process. The cost of having a device damaged by water recovered varies greatly depending on the device type, what was damaged, etc. But don't expect to get this recovered for less than $600.
* Do not put your device in the freezer. Doing so creates condensation on the platters which will destroy your data and it leaves you with less room to store leftovers. This technique can work in an extremely limited set of scenarios, but you'd be better off simply placing the drive in front of an air conditioner than subjecting it to a freezer if you happened to be in one of those scenarios. Which I would bet good money you are not.
* Conventional hard drives make all sorts of interesting noises when they fail. If you hear a noise that sounds like grinding or scraping, stop attempting the recovery immediately and inspect the platters and heads, it's likely that you have a crashed head. If you hear clicking, this can be caused by PCB/firmware issues or platter/head damage. Clicking can also be caused by damage to/corruption of the service area of the drive which can be bypassed or repaired with advanced equipment.
* Inspect the PCB board on the outside of the drive by removing it and using a magnifying glass if necessary. If you see any areas that are burned or smell smoky, the PCB likely needs to be replaced. You cannot simply swap a PCB board, you need to transfer the ROM and adaptive information using a tool like a PC-3000 or by de-soldering the ROM chip and re-soldering it to a new board. Many sellers on eBay can do this for you for around $60-$80, Outsource data recovery also [offers this for $60]( https://outsourcedatarecovery.com/repair-services/), I have used them in the past and they are great. If you have contacts that are corroded or dirty, gently clean them with an eraser. Data recovery for drives with damaged PCBs typically runs $400-$800.


**Step 2: Attempt to image the device**


If the device turns on and spins up (even if there is some clicking) but doesn't show up as a drive on your computer, there's a decent chance you can still recover the data using a Linux live CD/USB and ddrescue. Here's [a guide for that](https://www.data-medics.com/forum/how-to-clone-a-hard-drive-with-bad-sectors-using-ddrescue-t133.html). Ddrescue makes an image of the entire drive sector-by-sector and is agnostic to filesystems (meaning it will work on drives from any operating system, SD cards, DVDs, etc). The image will take up the same amount of space as the device your imaging. So if you are imaging a 500GB drive, the ddrescue image will be 500GB. It's important to make an image FIRST before attempting recovery with any software. Once you make the image, you can work on copies of the image and throw as much software at is as you want as opposed to running the software on the drive and risking losing the data permanently. If you more than a couple dozen bad sectors, ddrescue can shred your disk in the process of trying to image it. This would likely be due to platter damage or a bad head. If the drive doesn't register in a Linux live CD/ddrescue doesn't work on it (and you've ruled out a PCB swap), you won't be able to recover the data without investing in expensive data recovery hardware or sending it to a pro. Sorry.


If the device you're imaging is an android phone, a [guide like this](https://dfir.science/2017/04/Imaging-Android-with-root-netcat-and-dd.html) can help you make a dd image of the internal memory. 


Side note: There are some cases where imaging may not be the way to go. For example, if you know the file's location (and it wasn't deleted or is still in the MFT), some tools will be able to recover it by only touching the sectors they need to. A drive with platter damage or crashed heads (where the data isn't affected by the crashed head) or failing but sometimes working heads is an example of where such a technique might be valuable. By doing this, you lessen the chance that you'll accidentally destroy your wallet in attempts to image less important parts of the drive.


**Step 3: Run recovery tools on the image to recover your wallet**


Once you have an image of your device, you can now try various software tools to recover data from the image. The easiest thing to do is mount a read-only image in [Windows](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html) or [Linux](https://major.io/2010/12/14/mounting-a-raw-partition-file-made-with-dd-or-dd_rescue-in-linux/) and see if you can use the drive as normal and see your files. If you deleted your wallet or formatted your drive, this will not work.


If you deleted your wallet, you will need to use a file undeletion tool or a file carving tool. When files are deleted, they are not actually deleted, merely the pointers to those files are deleted. It's akin to taking down all the highway signs to New York but leaving the city there. Depending on the filesystem, the pointer may still exist and simply have a ""deleted"" flag next to it. File carving is used when this isn't the case and your data is somewhere in the ""un-used"" portion of the drive. DMDE, R-Studio, and GetDataBack are all great tools to undelete files. 

If you formatted the device your wallet was stored on, you'll need to recover the original formatting or use a file carving tool. Testdisk is a great free tool for search for partitions and filesystems. R-studio, DMDE, and other tools can also do this.

For file carving, you need to know which type of wallet you want to recover as different tools support different wallet formats. Many recovery softwares simply call file carving RAW recovery/deep search. If file carving doesn't find your wallet, but you know some keys, addresses, or notes you kept in your wallet, you can manually search the entire drive with a hex editor that supports large files. [Photorec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec)  is a free file carving tool which can recover wallets. There are also [specialized tools](https://Bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25091.0) for this purpose.


**Step 4: You recovered your wallet but don't know the password**
The guy behind [walletrecoveryservices.com](http://www.walletrecoveryservices.com) can crack your password in some instances. He has done some amazing work for people on this sub and is one of the few people who offers this service.


**Step 5: Importing your wallet and setting up a backup system**


Backup your existing wallet(s) and try importing the one you recovered. If it fails to import, you may need to extract the private keys from it and import those manually as the wallet could be corrupted. File carving is likely to produce corrupted wallets.


Once you have imported your wallet successfully, setup a backup system so this never happens to you again!


If you have any questions, please respond in this thread and I will do my best to answer them. I intent to update this guide once I know more about what parts people find confusing or useful.

"I had a dream of Satoshi last night, he has a message for all of you. Listen and listen carefully.","In my dream, I was walking through this corridor, the hounds of hell were hiding in the shadows. Far behind me a demon had been sleeping but slowly waking up, he lay there for almost a year. At the end of the corridor was a red brick wall that was taunting the demon. The wall was pulsing with inflamed anxiety. 

The demon, with it's long horns and blood thirsty eyes resembled that of a beastly bull. It was hungry and behind the red wall lay green pastures. 

The demon had a mark on it's forehead, it was a number which was the number of Satoshi himself. 

A voice came out from the wall and shouted to the demon. RISE! 

The beast awoke, it arched it's back and raised it's head. Everyone bowed down as it charged and pierced it's horns through the bleeding wall. The wall enraged grew larger as blood flowed down. The beast showed no mercy and continued to gouge out the bowels of the wall. 

The wall began to collapse and a flicker light appeared. It was Satoshi standing there, he had been waiting for the demon to awaken. He welcomed the beast and embraced it. He wore a long jacket and had just finished his cigarette, he flicked it down the corridor, it landed in the cold dampness glowing bright, where many have been waiting with heavy hearts. 

Satoshi turned to all those who bowed down to the beast and he commanded them...

"For those who bought bitcoin to get rich, my advise is to sell right now. This is the last time it will be $6k.","You know who you are. You've never read the white paper. You invested in bitcoin so you could get some big fiat payoff in the future.

I will say, as someone who has been here since 2010, you should sell now. Don't look back. The bottom is about to drop out so you should sell quickly. We tried but it looks like Bitcoin just can't get the regulations and ETF support that it needs to be successful. You may want to check out some solid municipal bonds as an alternative place for your money.

Sorry to have put you through all of the volatility. Your government issued currency is backed by the word of politicians. Much better backing than the unknown cryptography (likely to be hacked any day now) behind Bitcoin.

But don't take my advise as I am not certified by my government to give financial advice. Speak to your financial adviser and he will explain to you a great portfolio prospectus. 

Or hell, wouldn't you prefer to just spend your money? Buy the latest thing that is hot right now. Do you have the latest smart phone? No? That is something you need to survive.

We here at Bitcoin will just go back to our fantasy money of unicorns and rainbows that makes absolutely no sense to you. Nothing to see here. Just a bunch of nerds and geeks doing what we do between games of DnD in our parents basements.

I wanted to do this but finally I decided to wait some more time and see what happens. That was a mistake, I should buy them and hold until a price reach a sky high amounts! I was so angry, I just missed an opportunity of my life! Then I decided to do anything to fix my mistakes and be rich,being a white-hat security expat ,  I used my hacking experience to ""take"" ( I don't like a ""steal"" word ) Bitcoins and later other cryptocurriencies from cheaters of exchange markers  and online gambling site.

I've stared in 2010 when a cryptocurrency markets and online casinos didn't have a that good protection as today. Cryptocurriencies was a new thing in those years, so a websites that using them was a quite buggy, that was my opportunity! I will not put there a name of markets and casinos from where I have this money, for my safety reasons. My first target was a online casino in 2010,a casino know for making their unsuspecting player lose a great deal during their bets, from where I tooked a huge amount of Bitcoins, even for that times. I become a rich man so easy, but I was scared too, that was my first ""Black-hat"" hacking success but I don't know that it was done safe enough to keep me anonymous. I decided to split those Bitcoins into many irregular amounts to many Bitcoin wallets and keep those wallet files on my pen-drives which I hide in place where nobody will find them. I was not spend those money right after this, I was wait until everybody forgot about this. Meanwhile, I hacked other cheating markets and online gambling sites.

I was doing that until 2015, security level of markets and casinos in those 5 years was raised amazingly fast, so in 2015 I decided to stop doing what I was doing and focus on providing for my family as i am now a very rich man. I was thinking that will be the most easy part, but it was difficult just as hacking websites.

How can I spend this money without being suspicious? I was a rich man and a poor man at the same time! and to make things worst i lost the love of my life to cancer. I can't buy expensive cars, because a Tax Office will get me, I can't buy a house, because Tax Office will get me too...and i would go to prison and leave my children without a father and mother.... However I decided to do something with that. I created my own company, hired a peoples, and I start a ""wash"" process of my ""tooked"" money.

We are  in 2018  right now, so it's 3 years past when I hacked anyone, and I realized that I can't wash all of that money! That's why I'm here. I'm looking for a serious person that want to earn a BIG amount of cash in the most easy way. When you Buy one of my wallets I receive from you a clean money, and in return you receive a **10X** more ILLEGAL money! which can be useful to you....maybe to get you child that Christmas gift she has always wanted,or buy your dream house or car, or even start that business you have been thinking about.

How it's possible?

This wallets was created by me a long time ago (from 2010 to 2015) and Bitcoins inside of them, comes from hacked cheating cryptocurrency markets, and mostly from cryptocurrency illegal gambling sites. I have created a huge amount of wallets, where I splited between them a cryptocurriencies. ALL MY WALLET ADDRESSES CAN BE CHECKED BY YOU ON [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1KDUcZh5Z6H1of4Pwoy5ojJtkQxcQBHhnH](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1KDUcZh5Z6H1of4Pwoy5ojJtkQxcQBHhnH) On Blockchain.com website, you can paste wallet address and check amount of wallet, transaction list for this wallet, and date of receiving a coins! All wallets will have only one incoming transaction.

-------------

1 MB blocks are not enough for the Lightning Network.
2 MILLION YEARS years are needed just to open the channels.

-------------

The size of a transaction opening a Lightning channel is :

weight = 500 + 172 * num-outputs + 224

The smallest possible size is ~900 B.

A single 1MB block can handle ~1165 of these transactions.

At the moment there are 7.6 BLN people in the world. How many days are needed for each one of them to open a channel?

(7'600'000'000/1163)*6*24

The needed days are

Converted to years:
2'576'358 years are needed for every person on earth to open 1 lightning channel once.

2 MILLION YEARS !!!!!!

(And that is only if Bitcoin is Not used for Anything else other than opening channels.
Only Openings !
For these 2 MLN years closing channels, sending bitcoin or doing anything else whatsoever is halted.)

///////

I don't see any error with my calculation, but even if there is an error, how big is the difference?
10 times?
100 times?
Even if I made an error of 1000 times, it would still take more than Your Entire Lifetime for every person to open a lightning channel.

Bip148 questions,"I’m trying to get my head around the usaf.

When bip148 is deployed, at that point, roughly 80% of fullnodes are ready for SegWit. And from what I understand, full nodes that upgrade to bip148 will start rejecting blocks that doesn’t signal SegWit.


So what would happen if less than 50% of the fullnodes updated to bip148? Does full nodes that upgrades to bip148 still reject none SegWit ready blocks?

Doesn’t this easily create a chain split? Even just among the full nodes?? Since I would assume only a fraction of fullnodes will update to bip148? So we basically relying on miners to assume that most fullnode will actually update to bip148?

The first time I wrote this post, I made a pretty big calculation mistake.  
Big thanks to [u/pwuille](https://www.reddit.com/user/pwuille) who noticed it and explained it to me.  
I deleted my previous post by myself, because the error was simply too big.  
Now I have calculated the duration properly and... it is still an enormous number.   
The post is once again here.

The size of a transaction opening a Lightning channel is :

&gt;weight = 500 + 172 \* num-outputs + 224

The smallest possible size is \~900 B.

A single 1MB block can handle \~1165 of these transactions.

In a single day, the channels that can be opened are:

&gt;TX-Per-Day = 1165 \* 6 \* 24  
 TX-Per-Day = 167760

167760 looks like a big number, but…

 For these 124 years, closing channels, sending bitcoin or doing anything else whatsoever is halted.

What if people want to close these channels too?  
 What if people want to add more BTC to their Lightning Nodes?

 124 years for opening.  
 124 years for putting more BTC on the Lightning Nodes.  
 124 years for closing.

///////

Even if you say that Bitcoin is a luxury good and only the richest 1%  of the world should use it, people would still need over 1 year to open  their channels.  
Why would rich people of the west choose to wait 1 year, when there are alts that can be used right now?

When price action is poor I often find myself doubting the real world value of BTC and cryptocurrencies,"
Then I remind myself of the real issues I personally see with the current system:

- When I spend money from my current account it can take days to show the correct balance on my account due to ‘pending payments’. It makes no sense in a digital age

- When I get paid for my work in the UK from a US employee it takes 2-3 days to receive the money and costs my employer ~3% to make the payment. (It takes &lt;1 second for an HTTP request to get across the Atlantic

I’m not saying crypto has all the answers in its current form but the fact remains, the above is broken and needs fixing.

IELTS introduction

The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) measures the language proficiency of people who want to study or work where English is used as a language of communication. It uses a nine-band scale to clearly identify levels of proficiency, from non-user (band score 1) through to expert (band score 9).

IELTS Academic or IELTS General Training

IELTS is available in two test versions: Academic - for people applying for higher education or professional registration, and General Training for those migrating to Australia, Canada and the UK, or applying for secondary education, training programmes and work experience in an English-speaking environment. Both versions provide a valid and accurate assessment of the four language skills: listening, reading, writing and speaking. 

IELTS treats all test takers with the utmost fairness and respect by actively avoiding cultural bias, and  accepting all standard varieties of native-speaker English, including North American, British, Australian and New Zealand English.

IELTS is available at more than 1,200 locations worldwide, including more than 50 locations in the USA, and there are 48 test dates a year.

"WB21 Is A Verified Scam: Do not trust their ""Bitcoin Friendliness""","I bring this up in /r/Bitcoin because many users and services have trouble with banks. WB21 appeared as a solution to this but they are just a scam.

They will accept incoming funds and credit your account but you will never be able to get it out. They will lie about outgoing payments until you give up.

They appear to offer Bitcoin services, this is a lie. Bitcoin can be sent to them and credited to your account; but you cannot withdraw. You can ""transfer"" bitcoin but only to another WB21 member. They do not offer BTC withdrawals, I have thoroughly inquired about this many times.

I hope this gets visibility and stops others from being scammed by this company.",1534071509,12/08/2018 10:58:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96oexk/wb21_is_a_verified_scam_do_not_trust_their/,1

Is this true?,"\&gt; 1 MB blocks are not enough for the Lightning Network.  


125 years are needed just to open the channels.  


The size of a transaction opening a Lightning channel is :  


weight = 500 + 172 \* num-outputs + 224  


The smallest possible size is \~900 B.  


A single 1MB block can handle \~1165 of these transactions.  


In a single day, the channels that can be opened are:  


TX-Per-Day = 1165 \* 6 \* 24  
TX-Per-Day = 167760  


167760 looks like a big number, but…  


At the moment there are 7.6 BLN people in the world. How many days are needed for each one of them to open a channel?  


people / channels-per-day  
7600000000 / 167760  


The needed days are  


45302 days  


Converted to years:  
124 years are needed for every person on earth to open 1 lightning channel once.

The future of block chain and how NULS will change it!,"An average block chain team size is roughly 10 people and less including devs, now imagine a cryptocurrency with 100 devs working on it and what it could achieve... now imagine 1000, or 100,000 devs all working together on one project to make it user friendly and viable for mass adoption of every need and want to every enterprise, this is nuls vision and this is how they will change the future of block chain.

How will they achieve this?

NULS tech is modular by design, where each module can be removed and “upgraded” then replaced or stored for specific uses WITHOUT the need for forking! No more dividing the people who want different things like bitcoin, the modular approach allows anyone and everyone to contribute anything they see fit just by adding or editing their own modules for everyone to use. It means that new block chain technology developed in the future can be easily implemented into nuls through upgrading and adding modules by devs making it very cost effective and the most efficeintly designed cryptocurrency. Meaning nuls will never be outdated! This new technology is already highly coveted by many organisations and seen as the best method proving this with over 7 big partnernships waiting to build on nuls including MC payments, a gigantic payment system almost as big as Visa in SIngapore! Old generation platforms such as neo is also trying to replicate nuls modular design so they do not fall behind. Now with main net just launched the real development of nuls begins with everyone able to contribute!

Nuls is now calling for all developers and has already found many exceptionally talented community developers, for instance the nuls explorer run on [nuls.world](https://nuls.world) was created by a community member Moshe, now an offical communtiy developer employed by nuls and a team of many more talented devs are being assembled at this very moment with a list of tasks to make nuls the biggest and mass adopted block chain platform via ease of use and every module for every enterprise need. Think about a place where every module you could need is stored, you need a POW consensus? No problem install that module, just configure what you need and run it making it adoptable for all enterprises with no knowledge of blockchain. Eventually all businesses will be run through block chain as all the overheads and paperwork etc will be easily managed through blockchain which can't be tampered with.

NULS vision is what sets it apart from all other crypto and with its modular infrastructure and its giant supportive community of currently 12k members in telegram which they call “family” all willing to help with their each unique skills. NULS is already one of the highest tps and main net was launched flawlessly with a core team who already created inchain, they are so exceptional yet most humble with the ability to draw the best out of the community. Many community devs are now lining up to help! NULS will accelerate progress and adoption from this approach and I predict it will be the biggest and most widely used block chain platform by 2019!

Tool for faster trades on social media news with push notifications,"Hello,

I made and have been using a little python program for myself for years now, where i can manage my social media push notifications on mobile. On request i now implemented a website version for everyone..

Basically you paste a subreddit or twitter url and set filters (f.e. contains phrases or min karma) to your needs. Then you will receive fitting posts to your connected devices.

Now simply put all niche-relevant finance/news channels in there and filter it so you get notified whenever something is posted about bitcoin/altcoin/stock/whatever that you hold or watch -&gt; instant buy/sell. It was often really helpful/lucrative to get a certain info a few hours or even minutes sooner. I hope it helps you too!

You can find the beta version under [pushm.io](https://pushm.io)

Tool for faster trades on social media news about coins that you hold,"Hello,

I made and have been using a little python program for myself for years now, where i can manage my social media push notifications on mobile. On request i now implemented a website version for everyone..

Basically you paste a subreddit or twitter url and set filters (f.e. contains phrases or min karma) to your needs. Then you will receive fitting posts to your connected devices.

Now simply put all niche-relevant finance/news channels in there and filter it so you get notified whenever something is posted about bitcoin/altcoin/stock/whatever that you hold or watch -&gt; instant buy/sell. It was often really helpful/lucrative to get a certain info a few hours or even minutes sooner. I hope it helps you too!

You can find the beta version under [pushm.io](https://pushm.io)

Crypto IRA: Save $$$'s in SDIRA Fees and IRS Taxes,"# Bitcoin IRA and Checkbook IRA-LLC Investing

Many people are surprised to learn that they can use an IRA or 401k for Bitcoin HODLing or trading. Even those that are familiar with Self-Directed IRAs (SDIRAs) are unaware of the Checkbook IRA-LLC, which enables you (a) to invest IRA money on the Bitcoin exchange of your choice and (b) to purchase any cryptocurrency. Using a Checkbook IRA-LLC, from the right service provider can save you thousands of dollars (or millions - it's proportionate to the value of your cryptocurrency assets).

With a Custodial Self-Directed IRA (without a Checkbook IRA-LLC), the custodian holds and controls your cash and assets. The custodian makes money by charging asset-based fees and transaction fees. (I'm told they also earn interest on the cash they hold ""for you"".) These fees can add up very quickly and the lack of control holds up your investments. Most importantly, with a custodian holding your assets you're unable to invest in cryptocurrencies (unless you use overpriced Bitcoin IRA providers that charge a percentage of assets and limit the coins that you can buy).

In contrat, with a Checkbook IRA-LLC you’re in control. Through a special purpose IRA-LLC, you can move your IRA money to a bank account - giving you direct control of your money and marginalizing the custodian. Unfortunately, the custodian can't be completely eliminated, as the IRS requires that every IRA have a custodian.

# Bitcoin IRA with ReSure Financial: My Experience

My CPA recommended that I use a Checkbook IRA to buy-and-sell Bitcoin and introduced me to ReSure Financial. He explained that the IRS has harsh treatment of crypto trades, expecting to be paid even if I never exchange my crypto for fiat - this could result in large tax liability without having the cash to pay it (unless the IRS starts accepting crypto).

The process of setting up my Self-Directed Roth IRA-LLC took me about a 2 weeks, around $1,000 in fees, and less paperwork than expected. I used a Roth IRA (as opposed to a Traditional IRA) for maximum tax benefit, as with a Traditional IRA I would have to pay taxes on the distributions from the account upon retirement.

(For those with self-employment income, a Self-Directed Solo 401K - with even lower fees - is the best option. The best structure is a Solo 401k-LLC, which provides the greatest current and future flexibility. However, it requires Solo 401k eligibility.)

The process is was more straightforward than I would have imagined and a ReSure Financial representative ""held my hand"" from start to finish. Following are the steps that I took to get my Roth IRA invested crypto:

1. Navigate to ReSure Financial's Checkbook IRA/401k website (URL: [https://www.401kcheckbook.com](https://www.401kcheckbook.com/)) and complete a web-based Checkbook IRA application (URL: [https://www.401kcheckbook.com/checkbook-control-retirement-get-started/](https://www.401kcheckbook.com/checkbook-control-retirement-get-started/))
2. ReSure Financial will use your online Checkbook IRA application to create your Self-Directed IRA-LLC, of which you will be the manager. If your web application indicated that you want assistance with completing the form, a ReSure Financial representative will reach out to you and address any questions.
3. ReSure Financial will assist you with opening a low-cost self-directed IRA account with one of their IRA custodian partners. They will assist you with the forms for funding this new IRA, either by transferring money from a pre-existing      IRA or by making a new IRA contribution.
4. ReSure Financial will help you open a bank account with the bank of your choice or with bankers with whom they work to open bank accounts for IRA-LLCs, Solo 401(k)s, and Solo 401(k)-LLCs. This is an invaluable service, as most bankers are not familiar with these accounts.
5. Once your new SDIRA is funded, ReSure Financial will help you complete an Investment Direction form for the SDIRA custodian directing them to transfer IRA funds to your IRA-LLC.
6. Once the IRA-LLC bank checking account is funded, it can be used to fund crypto exchange accounts through which to purchase crypto assets.
7. Congrats!  You now own tax-free crypto.

Prior to investing with your Checkbook IRA-LLC, you should be aware of the following:

**Your Checkbook IRA’s money should not be mingled with your personal funds. Likewise, crypto that you personally own must be kept separate from Bitcoin owned by your SDIRA-LLC.** The reason for this is to prevent committing a ""[crypto IRA-LLC prohibited transaction](https://www.401kcheckbook.com/checkbook-control-retirement-alternative-investments/self-directed-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/)"" that could disqualify your IRA.

With this plan you can buy-and-sell your LLC’s cryptocurrency holdings at any point in time in exchange for any other cryptos or fiat currencies. (Just remember that those assets belong to the IRA-LLC and all IRA rules apply to them. Don't use them to pay your personal expenses.)  

If you're not familiar with the Crypto IRA-LLC structure, it might be costing you a fortune. Using a Bitcoin Checkbook IRA has saved me $10,000s - so far - in SDIRA fees and IRS tax liability.",1534093079,12/08/2018 16:57:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96qgyn/crypto_ira_save_s_in_sdira_fees_and_irs_taxes/,1

I want to hold these coins for long term. Need a safe wallet where I will be able to store all my coins. As I have heard that servers where users' private keys are kept by wallets can be hacked, I want to hold my coins in a wallet which stores private keys locally or gives exclusive access of private key to the user (the one which doesn't store private key anywhere). I am not willing to spend money on hardware wallets. I am planning to store these coins on a desktop or a mobile wallet (or a wallet like metamask &amp; myetherwallet). Planning to buy a new desktop or mobile which I will use only for the purpose of storing cryptos &amp; will keep the device disconnected from internet until I want to sell my coins.

Learning to Generate Bitcoin Addresses with Math: What Am I Doing Wrong?,"For a few days I've spent some time trying to learn how to generate usable bitcoin addresses from random numbers. I've been trying to follow the explanation [here](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#generating-a-private-key-from-a-random-number) but I'm clearly doing something wrong.

I started with this premise: Public Key = a Private Key multiplied by the Generator Point. I get this from this sentence from the above chapter: ""K = k * G, where k is the private key, G is a constant point called the generator point, and K is the resulting public key."" I found out what bitcoin's generator point was, and multiplied it by 1 in order to get a public key for the simplest possible bitcoin address -- a bitcoin address with private key 1.

Now, I'm not the first person to try this -- other people have discovered that 1 is indeed a valid private key, and the resulting bitcoin address, once you've properly generated it from that private key (i.e. from the number 1), is [1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm](https://blockchain.info/address/1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm).

However, I'm having trouble because, to my own eyes, I seem to be following the steps accurately, but I'm not getting that address as the result. Ergo, I think my eyes are deceiving me.

I started by multiplying 1 times the hexadecimal representation of the generator point. That got me 479BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798483ADA7726A3C4655DA4FBFC0E1108A8FD17B448A68554199C47D08FFB10D4B8 as a result, because that lengthy string I just posted is the generator point, and when you multiply the generator point by 1, you get the generator point. On the assumption that is indeed the K I am looking for, I figured the next step is to run it through the SHA256 algorithm and then take that result and run it through the RIPEMD160 algorthithm. I.e. I decided to use the following instruction, with the above hex code as K: (RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))) I got this from the article I linked to: ""Starting with the public key K, we compute the SHA256 hash and then compute the RIPEMD160 hash of the result, producing a 160-bit (20-byte) number: ... RIPEMD160(SHA256(K)).""

What I ended up with was 7C61B8748A8E86A9D690B0435B5D5C78682686AB. The next step is to prefix two 00s to the front so that the first number is a 1 -- or so I infer from these sentences: ""Bitcoin addresses are almost always encoded as 'Base58Check'... To convert data (a number) into a Base58Check format, we first add a prefix to the data, called the 'version byte,' which serves to easily identify the type of data that is encoded. For example, in the case of a bitcoin address the prefix is zero (0x00 in hex)""

So I turned 7C61B8748A8E86A9D690B0435B5D5C78682686AB into 007C61B8748A8E86A9D690B0435B5D5C78682686AB. The next step is to append a checksum, which consists of the first four bytes of a double-sha256 hash of the previous number -- so says this sentence: ""Next, we compute the ""double-SHA"" checksum, meaning we apply the SHA256 hash-algorithm twice on the previous result (prefix and data)...[and] take only the first four bytes...[which get] concatenated (appended) to the end.""

I got the SHA256 double-hash and appended the first four bytes, which turned out to be 91EFCDCC. The resulting string, with both prefix and suffix, was 007C61B8748A8E86A9D690B0435B5D5C78682686AB91EFCDCC. That should be all I had to do other than put it in base58 format, so I did that, and got this as the resulting address: 1CLfrXeERGDusnyV6i4ph9DBeVrFXBbWv7 -- but that's not a valid bitcoin address, nor does it match the address I thought I was supposed to get. So what did I do wrong? Any help?",1534097503,12/08/2018 18:11:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96r0tw/learning_to_generate_bitcoin_addresses_with_math/,1

Why bitcoin over Tether or other stable coins?,"First of all, I am not in favor of any coins and this is a genuine question out of curiosity.

I support the push for blockchain tech and cashless cryptocurrency society. However if we wanted a certain coin as a commodity, why would people or government prefer Bitcoin over Tether or other upcoming stable coins?

Bitcoin as of now to me is an asset flip with the active volume being 99% from trading. Surely the volatility and the ROI is attractive; but for actual usage of what cryptocurrency is intended for, why would the price fluctuation matter in transactions? Regardless of whether if it's at $1 or $1,000,000 per Bitcoin, point A transferring $500 to point B would still be $500 given that it is exchanged upon receiving.

Wouldn't it be more ideal to just use Tether, instead of using Bitcoin where if your fund gets locked in an exchange for whatever reason or a sudden dump occurs and lose money? If the blockchain technology's sole purpose and the tech itself stays the same, then isn't the exchange price just a bubble?",1534101332,12/08/2018 19:15:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96rigy/why_bitcoin_over_tether_or_other_stable_coins/,1

Bitcoin's legitimate cause,"I've been somewhat trolling on here for a long time, and have been banned a few times for getting into nasty discussions. Here's the deal, bitcoin will never replace currency. It's not a practical currency and never will be. But, as a store of value, like gold, it could be huge for these countries whose fiat currencies are collapsing. Venezuela, Turkey, and a few others as they come. Just like anything, this just needs better value stability then the currency to work well. It's a great option. Fair due to those that believe USD will collapse as well. I get it, but it's just not going to happen. Better to make your money grow in time- tested investments. Balance it out. Don't throw everything you have into this belief.

Dollar cost averaging Plus,"I just wanted to share my technique for investing in Bitcoin. It is based on the so-called dollar cost averaging: you accumulate spread over time so in the end you got your BTC at around the average price of that full time period. 

The addition I’m doing is that with lower prices I will buy more. Actually it’s pretty simple but the end result is that your average is actually pulled down a lot. 

Plan:
- estimate the amount of Fiat you want to invest
- create an excel where you put the current BTC price, the second line is eg 100$ bellow current price and drag that down to eg BTC rate of 1000$. 
- in the second column you put the amount in btc you’ll buy now: eg 0.01. This column you let increase every row. Eg with 10% every row. 
- configure the initial amount and increase rate so that your total budget fits the plan. 
- put these orders in on your favourite exchange.  
It will be sth like 
0.01 btc @ 6000$
0.011 btc @ 5900 $
0.012 btc @ 5800 $

Only disadvantage here is: in case btc rate doesn’t drop too far you have not invested all you wanted to (less even than dollar cost averaging)

I’ve been doing this for a while now. The advantage is you’ll never be sad when BTC drops because it means you accumulated more ;)",1534107930,12/08/2018 21:05:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96sceu/dollar_cost_averaging_plus/,1

"If you want to feel confident in your investment despite this price action, it is very easy.","Use this time to learn. Watch some Andreas Antonopoulos first to learn about Bitcoin. If you don’t have time grab his audiobook from Amazon. Next, familiarize yourself with the economics of Bitcoin. I found the podcast Bitcoin Knowledge to be a great starting point.  Trace makes it easy to understand.  The next part is up to you whether you want to dive deeper down the technical rabbit hole and grab a copy of Mastering Bitcoin, or start learning more about money and debt and different schools of Economics.  Once you realize the potential of the technology, and the economic value of having the best form of money ever created that is also a great store of value, the panic just completely disappears. You realize that the volatility we are experiencing is unavoidable when you combine the psychology of the market with the break neck pace Bitcoin is going on it’s road to becoming the world reserve currency.

Check here,"What is 'Bitcoin Mining'?

*Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoin are released. Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining. The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle.  The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards.  The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin.* 

***These are an industry leading Bitcoin mining pool. All of the mining power is backed up by physical miners. Mining with the latest algorithms allows to make as much Bitcoin as possible. They aim to provide you with the easiest possible way to make money without having to do any of the hard stuff.***  
 

***With data centers around the globe, we aim to keep bills down and mining power high, meaning you can make more in a shorter amount of time than what it would take to mine from your home for instance. Their data centers are located in Europe, USA and China with dedicated Up-Links and 99% uptime!***",1534129243,13/08/2018 03:00:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96usng/check_here/,1

How Did I Survive and even Earn Money in the Bear Market of Bitcoin?,"A vast range of people have experienced the roller coaster in the up and down of bitcoin market from 2017 to 2018. And many of them have suffered great loss in the winter of bitcoin as two-thirds of value disappeared in this dark period. I used to, while end up fetching a small fortune in the bear market.
 
The changeover of my fate in the bear market comes from my insight of the bitcoin market, and open mind that is bold enough to accept all new trading forms. Future trading, a high-risk and also high-profit investment I occasionally know from OKEx, changed my conservative prospective on how I used to perform trading. 
 
Future trading is a kind of short-selling that enables users to bet on the market trend, namely, users can buy either future increasing or declining price. When the bitcoin fell at $6800, I bet on the declining price with 20x profit of 20% off my bitcoins as I predicate that it will keep falling. I’m patient enough to wait and finally sold all when the price reached $6050. So far, my original 50 bitcoins bring me $6050*50+$750*20*10, equal to: $452,500. Compared to the revenue when the price is $6800, I earned $602,500-$6800*50=$112, 500. 

Tips:
1.      the reason why I choose to do future trading at $6800 is that the price has gone through ups and downs from $6800 and finally reaches $6800, showing that it’s the best point to bet on. And so does why I sold all at $6050.
2.      Be cautious about the ratio to do future trading, as it can bring you high profit, heavy loss neither. I chose OKEx to try future trading because it offers 10x and 20x, and I think both of them are the most reasonable and secure points to bet on.",1534131068,13/08/2018 03:31:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96uzw9/how_did_i_survive_and_even_earn_money_in_the_bear/,1

"Crypto Millionaire Lost 5,500 Bitcoins in Alleged Investment Scam","According to a media report from Bangkok Post on Monday, a group approached and solicited Finnish businessman Aarni Otava Saarimaa in June 2017 over investment in several Thai stocks, a casino in Macau and a new cryptocurrency called Dragon Coin. The group claimed that upon issuance, Dragon Coin could be used at the casino. They brought Saarimaa to the Macau casino in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of the project. Saarimaa, who bought into the scheme, transferred a total of 5,564 bitcoins to the group. 

Having seen no returns months after the investment, Saarimaa filed a complaint to Thailand's Crime Suppression Division (CSD) in January. The CSD launched an investigation and found out that the group did not make any investments for Saarimaa, but instead liquidated all the bitcoins into Thai baht and deposited the funds into seven bank accounts. They also suspected that the Thai film actor Jiratpisit ""Boom"" Jaravijit was involved in the plan and arrested him last Wednesday.

He paid with paypal. It went in to my account, I was happy, sent the item and all was well. UNTIL it was backcharged and despite me having copious amount of evidence, paypal sided with the scammer saying because it was a ""fraudulent payment"" they have to reverse it. 

So I lost my money and my account.

Daily Market Recap - 08/13 -,"The Bitcoin (BTC) is back in an uptrend as rises 2.90% over the day. Its dominance is through the roof at 51.2%. The bearish trend has pushed the investors back to Bitcoin to reach 50% of the total market capitalization for the first time since December 2017. This past week, the Bitcoin was dragging below $6500 and holding tight at $6100. There were fears of dropping further below the $6k level. At one time, it did break the $6k support but the bulls have successfully defended the level and prevented further losses by bringing up the price above $6200.

Currently, it is trading at $6457 after a breakout this morning. If the volume cannot support the push for $6500, the Bitcoin might remain around $6400 which is our current support. This is the third day that Bitcoin has been moving forward. A continuing uptrend is expected towards $6500 and $6600. While the technical chart still shows BTC as decidedly bearish. The bulls are beginning to recover. On the downside, there is still a possibility of a drop back to $6k and the Bitcoin must stay above $6,280 to maintain its current momentum.

Certain analysts predict that it's dominance over the market is a major bullish signal and will spell another bull run as this level of dominance was only last seen before its bull run in 2017. However, most of them agree that the test will come when it breaks $6800 as it had difficulties in the past recovering beyond this level. At the moment, it is still hard to see which way it will go in the short term.

Help Australia raise money for our farmers in need through the power of Bitcoin!," Hey guys,

Across  Australia, our farmers are in crisis as they struggle with severe  drought conditions, that have been on going for some years now. Families  are having to forgo putting food on their own tables, in order to have  enough money to feed their animals, or water their crops, in order to  salvage their own living.

While our  government has been quite lazy in helping out our own, many businesses  across Australia have been putting up their hands to help, whether it be  running fundraisers, or donating profits. This week, I'd like to  contribute on behalf of our bitcoin community, by hosting “Bitcoin for a  Bale” this Friday, the 17th of August.

On  this day, I will be collecting Bitcoin donations, as well as donating  100% of my profits from the days trade to “Buy a Bale” – a charity  organization here in Australia that helps support Aussie farmers by  purchasing much needed supplies such as food and water for stock and  crops, as well as sending emergency relief to farmers such as food and  funds to help manage the bills.

Not only  will this help many in need, but I also  hope that by having people from  across the globe donate to such a cause, it may help in relieving the  stigma that Crypto is “just a currency to be used on the dark net to do  bad things” and help promote the perspective that it can be used for  good as well – such as helping a charitable cause raise funds for people  in need.

For all the info on how to donate, as well as what you can do to help, please go to: 📷[www.bitcoin-babe.com/…/-funds-for-a-farmer-in-need](https://www.bitcoin-babe.com/single-post/2018/08/11/Bitcoin-for-a-Bale-Help-raise-funds-for-a-farmer-in-need)

I hope you guys can help! Much love!

BTC growth: the eternal question,"I keep hearing the same question over and over again: what will happen to bitcoin? Will it grow? Will it drop? I mostly get this from people far from the crypto world.   
   
At the same time, people familiar with the matter collect ‘mathematical signs’. Here is a diagram – they point at some diagram – and this means either growth or decline. Those people are disconnected from reality and do not learn from history.    
   
There were guys who founded a company called Long-Term Capital Management back in the 90s. Two Nobel laureates were among the founders. They honestly believed in the predictive power of statistics, mathematics and probability theory. Then, a number of events those guys considered unlikely or even impossible occurred in 1998. The company went bankrupt. Predictive power of mathematical models proved ineffective on the exchange. Now everybody forgot this story: people still like hiring physicists and developing AI to gamble on stock exchanges.      
   
Personally, I do not believe in such things. Nobody can predict the future. Neither Warren Buffett, nor physicists, let alone economists. And astrologists can’t help because they are not good with predictions either. Thus, my conclusion is relatively simple: nobody knows what the future will bring.    
   
We can try to build the future we want, though. Do I want crypto and bitcoin to grow? I do. I’m not going to lie. I will get profits from this. But what keeps BTC from growing? Bad marketing.    
   
Many ordinary people know there is such thing as bitcoin and some even know what cryptocurrencies are. The thing is, an ordinary person does not have any reasons to get into this game. Many members of the crypto community do not think much of newcomers, taking them for fools because they did not see the potential in cryptocurrencies. However, the whole crypto world now is not bigger than an Esperanto lovers club. So if we want the crypto community to expand, we need new blood; in fact, we need more people than we already have.    
   
I believe that our task is to attract ordinary people in the crypto world, not to treat them as fools. The long-awaited growth of crypto will happen only if we adopt this policy.    
   
The next fair question is: what should we do? How can we attract people?    
There always are unemployed people, people with lots of free time and those who work from home. Me and my team are currently putting a great deal of energy and time into attracting freelancers, people who want to offer their services, to our marketplace where they can find clients and receive payments in crypto. We have to explain (over and over again) how to receive and store crypto, and what they can do with it afterwards. And you know what? Almost all of them agree to publish their ads on our website. This is additional income and advertising – so, why not?   
   
I’m not saying we are doing everything right. I just think that our actions have more impact on the community than endless attempts to predict the future of bitcoin. ",1534166731,13/08/2018 13:25:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96y9tt/btc_growth_the_eternal_question/,1
Required reading: The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous,"In these seemingly bearish times, this book should help you to remember why you got involved with this incredible piece of tech. 

Never has their been such potential to transform the world of hard money, and there may likely never be one again in our lifetimes. 

The author gives an in-depth history of money as well as the different economic schools of thought, with a particular distaste for keynesian economics.

It then gives good reason for why bitcoin has the potential to be the reserve currency of the world. It  closes with good reasoning for why blockchain technology may only ever have use with bitcoin, and not much else. 

Anyone looking for a deeper dive into the history of money and the need for something like bitcoin should definitely give this book a go. It's truly insightful. ",1534167275,13/08/2018 13:34:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96ycae/required_reading_the_bitcoin_standard_by/,1

Weird Email - Maybe a Passphrase,"Hi Bitcoin Community

I got this weird email today. It is titled ""jzjagp"" and the content consists of 36 words that don't make sense to me. There is no link or picture in the message, only these 36 words. I've never heard of the sender. I thought that the 36 words might be a passphrase to a Bitcoin Wallet, but as far as I know you only need 12 or 24 words. Nevertheless I tried to put the words into a brainwallet, but nothing clever came out.

Most likely it's not a password to a wallet, how would someone just want to give money to someone else? Nevertheless, I would be interested to know what these 36 words mean. If anyone has any idea, I'd be very interested. And if this is actually a key to a little treasure and someone helps me dig it up, I will reward that person with half the treasure. I have attached a screenshot of the email to the post.

Detailed Fundamental Valuation of Bitcoin,"Hi Bitcoin community, I just released a longer research piece on the value of Bitcoin. I thought it would be great to share the report here on reddit and hopefully get some feedback from you. 

**Intro:** 

Various crypto valuation approaches have been pioneered over the last year by exponents such as Chris Burniske, Alex Evans, Dmitry Kalichkin, and others. Since I'm highly interested in evaluating cryptos (i.e. finding a ""fair"" price based on fundamentals / utility value) I started studying these different valuation methods to refine and professionalize them. My goal is to advance the practices how we value this new asset class and offer a more grounded view on cryptoasset prices.
Below you find a summary of my research that highlights the key results of my analysis. The full research can be downloaded here, if you want to dive in the details:  [Bitcoin Research Report](https://blocknovum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BlockNovum_Investment-Research_Bitcoin-August2018.pdf) 

**Key Results:** 

* The fundamental analysis based on Bitcoin's current &amp; future utility values yields a present value of $8,000 for August 2018 (Discount rate 30%).
* Hence, I see BTC still as a Buy with a target price of $8,000. Investors should aim to buy Bitcoin below this target price and account for their preferred margin of safety. 
* Bitcoin serves several promising use cases, which gives it fundamental value. In particular, the store of value use case, where Bitcoin serves as digital gold, offers enormous market potential with an estimated market size of $2.6 trillion served by BTC in 2028.
* A qualitative assessment framework and ratio analysis (NVT, P/M, NVM) confirms Bitcoin’s strong and continuously growing fundamentals and further supports the price target. However, another short-term price correction is a possibility if fundamental on-chain activity does not develop as expected. 
* **[Key Results](https://i.imgur.com/WhfG5YP.jpg)**



**Research Method:** 

The research is based on an extensive **fundamental valuation model** of Bitcoin. The value per BTC is based on the expected utility values that Bitcoin receives through enabling certain use cases. Simply speaking, these utility values are calculated by modeling supply and demand of Bitcoin and calculating the size of Bitcoin's monetary base through the ""equation of exchange"". Hence, Bitcoin is modeled as its own economy where BTC is used as its native currency to spend for receiving the utility/services of various use cases (e.g. digital store of value, enabling fast payments worldwide, or the ability to convert Fiat to another altcoin via BTC). I see mainly the ""store of value"" and ""gateway to other cryptoassets"" as the leading use cases for Bitcoin. 
My financial model then calculates the present value of a Bitcoin token, by discounting these future utility value inherent to one BTC at a discount rate of 30%. Consequently, the identified present value then helps decide if Bitcoin is under- or overvalued at today’s price level.
In addition, alternative valuation approaches are illustrated, such as cost-based valuation or ratio-analysis, to achieve a holistic valuation perspective and to verify the $8,000 valuation result. Finally, I also analyzed Bitcoin according to a set of key qualitative assessment factors. The complete analysis is then synthesized into a recommendation and investment profile.


**Summary of Bitcoin Investment Report:** 

According to my valuation I expect the price of Bitcoin to have a **current value of $8,000 per BTC**. This price is justified by the present values of the underlying future utility values of modeled Bitcoin use cases. The store of value (“digital gold”) use case, along with the usage as a gateway to other cryptoassets, promises a substantial addressable market size for Bitcoin. The size of the market served by BTC, for these two use cases alone, is estimated to be over $2.8 trillion in 2028. Further markets where Bitcoin acts as a transfer facilitator (though at a smaller scale) are digital payments, remittances, and banking of the unbanked.

Bitcoin’s characteristics as a fully digital, safe, decentralized, scarce and autonomous currency free from any government control makes it a perfect fit as a digital store of value asset with appreciation potential. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s ability to reduce transaction costs and simultaneously increase speed through technological improvements (e.g. Lightning Network) makes its usage highly attractive in the other aforementioned industries.

It is also estimated that **66%** of today’s present value of $8,000 is based on current utility value and **34%** accounts for speculation on future utility value.

**[Valuation model](https://i.imgur.com/2tLEunA.jpg)**

An alternative approach, **cost-based valuation**, predicts a price range of $7,440 and $8,670 per BTC, validating the fundamental valuation result. The ratio analysis — consisting of Network Value to Transactions Ratio (NVT), Price to Metcalfe Ratio (P/M), and Network Value to Metcalfe Ratio (NVM) indicates that BTC is currently largely supported by fundamentals. However, short-term corrections are a possibility if fundamentals don’t develop as expected or market sentiment stays bearish. For example, NVM shows signs of a temporary overvaluation of BTC, which might lead cautious investors to delay investing for a few months. 

Nevertheless, the **qualitative assessment** confirms BTC’s strong positioning in six assessment categories, which supports its leading role as a “blue chip” token in the cryptoasset space. Recent developments such as the announcement of Bakkt, a jointly launched company by Starbucks, NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange, and Microsoft to create an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets, highlight Bitcoin’s perceived potential among leading corporations.

I am posting this research as part of a small startup (BlockNovum) that I launched a few months ago to value cryptoasset tokens and blockchain startups. I am planning to launch more public research like this in the upcoming months, where I value cryptoassets. I'm also open to suggestions, which token to value next.

Interview it Phil Raymond,"**Today, I interviewed Phil Raymond. He** ***co-chairs CRYPSA, hosts the New York Bitcoin Event and is keynote speaker at Cryptocurrency Conferences. He sits on the New Money Systems board of Lifeboat Foundation and is a top Bitcoin writer at Quora.***

### For the people who don’t know you, what can you tell about yourself?

I was originally a hardware design engineer, creating electronic memory systems for computers and a few consumer products. Later, I started a company that designed and manufactured local area network devices for the smart building controls industry.

Back at college, I studied hardware engineering, of course. But I was always fascinated with encryption, compression and error correction. I studied under **Gilles Brassard** (inventor of Quantum Cryptography), and I met **Claude Shannon** (the father of information theory) and **David Chaum** (founder of DigiCash). In the early days of email, I latched onto PGP, RSA and the public key infrastructure that enables internet commerce. I realized that these concepts would enable transformative products and services, and that they would radically benefit consumers.

Nine years ago, **Satoshi** hit the scene with a solution to the Double-Spend problem. In a very brief whitepaper, he articulated the blockchain and even introduced a test platform which used a blockchain as a distributed consensus mechanism for digital cash that required no central nexus or authoritative bookkeeper. He called it “**Bitcoin**”.

I was fortunate to appreciate the tectonic importance of Satoshi’s gift to mankind. The **blockchain** and **Bitcoin** are easily misunderstood or dismissed today, but they are no less important than the internet or public key cryptography. They will radically change how we work, play, spend money and how we interact with each other. Ultimately, they will redefine the relationship between citizens and their governments, because these concept allow us to redefine trust and democracy in a way that more closely matches our goals and ideals.

I was involved in cryptocurrency early on, even in the pre-PayPal days of DigiCash and Digital Gold.

**So, what do I do today?**

I co-chair the Cryptocurrency Standards Association, a loose-knit collaborative of researchers, journalists, enthusiasts and vendors. I host the New York Bitcoin Event and more recently, I am keynote speaker at Cryptocurrency Conferences. I also sit on the New Money Systems board at Lifeboat Foundation. I am a top Bitcoin writer at Quora and editor of the Blog, AWildDuck.com

### What is blockchain and, how does it work?

We hear a lot about the blockchain. We also hear a lot of misconceptions about its purpose and benefits. Some have said that it represents a threat to banks or to governments. Nonsense! It is time for a simple, non-political, and non-economic definition…

#### What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed approach to bookkeeping. Because it opens and distributes the ledger among all participants, it offers an empowering, efficient and trusted way for disparate parties to reach consensus. It is “empowering”, because conclusions built on a blockchain can be constructed in a way that is inherently fair, transparent and resistant to manipulation. At scale, it is also massively redundant. This further leads to a hardened network which can resist loss whether caused by accident, faulty infrastructure or attack.

This is why blockchain-backed systems are generating excitement. Implemented as distributed and permissionless, they take uncertainty out of accounting, voting, legislation or research, and replace it with trust and security. Benefits are bestowed without the need for central authority or arbitration. The blockchain not only solves a fundamental transaction challenge, it addresses communication and arbitration problems that have bedeviled thinkers since the ancient Egyptians.

### What is a cryptocurrency and, how does it work?

Cryptocurrency is a blockchain-based token that has achieved a two-sided network and is used like money in payment for goods, services or debts. It is not simply traded by investors, hoarders and speculators (although these trades dominate the early adoption phase) — and it is not simply used as an asset-backed payment instrument like a gift card or debit card. (Those are instruments are tied to dollars or the solvency of banks and retailers). Rather, a cryptocurrency is traded with the potential to be the money itself. It’s value floats freely with supply and demand.

It is important to distinguish cryptocurrency from ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and other digital tokens. Cryptocurrency always refers to Bitcoin or other altcoins that are built on an open source, transparent and permissionless blockchain. They have no proprietary code or features, and every transaction from the very start of time is open to public scrutiny.

A cryptocurrency might have a functional purpose like some ICOs (That is, they might be used for something other than a payment instrument). But they are never associated with Airdrops, multi-level trading, or promotions that generate benefits to early adopters or those who refer. These gimmicks never apply to genuine cryptocurrencies. They are concepts from the marketers who hawk ICOs. Those are digital products for speculators and not a cryptocurrency.

#### How do they work?

Cryptocurrencies work by permitting trust without any central authority keeping the books. Instead of a bank or retailer tracking your ownership of coins, a network of miners act as a giant network of distributed accounts. Their activity maintains the transaction logs, attests to the validity of transactions and keeps track of who owns what.

#### Here are some really interesting facts about miners:

**(a)** Anyone can be a miner. There are no restrictions on joining the party

**(b)** Eventually, everyone will be a miner, whether they realize it or not. That is, it will become a part of every wallet. The reason that everyone will become a miner, is because the rewards will eventually run out. When they do, the spread of mining to all parties is the glue that will keep transactions fast, free and trusted.

**(c)** Miners don’t “see” that they are writing, validating, publishing and guaranteeing validity of the books. From their perspective, they are participating in a massive networked gaming community. They race other gamers, trying to solve a math puzzle, while seeking little rewards as they go along.

### Do you see future where we will adopt cryptocurrencies at international scale and, why?

It is inevitable! Someday, Cryptocurrencies will replace government issued currencies. I am certain of this. Why is this? Because **Bitcoin** is not only good for consumers, vendors, banks, lenders, creditors and NGOs — it is especially good for governments.

Today, some legislators and politicians fear that cryptocurrency will undermine a country’s control over its own monetary policy. This is true. Indeed, governments will lose that control. And this is good.

A government no more needs control over monetary policy as it does over telecommunications or the package delivery services. We are conditioned to believe that value comes from a trusted party, and this makes it hard to give up our assumption that governments must control the creation of wealth. But, in fact, nations are much healthier if they must balance their books like any individual, business, NGO, club, state or municipality. They can still borrow, of course. But they will no longer be able to print funny money and continuously hoist their debts onto unborn generations.

### Why did bitcoin reach such a high value??

**Bitcoin** had a significant rise in 2017. From $1000 to almost $20,000 per BTC unit. During that time, the subject spread like wildfire — and so, of course did investor interest. News stories flourished and these led to functional studies by banks, vendors, exchanges, and settlement houses. But, more than 95% of trades were made by investors, day traders, hoarders and speculators, and this leads to a volatile commodity. (Not a bubble, but a very rapidly changing value). This exchange value makes for great dinner-table discussion. It also makes some very rich and poor traders. But, in the end, it is quite meaningless.

In the end, **1 BTC will always be worth 1 BTC**. When the exchange rate fluctuates relative to the dollar or some other currency, you will wonder what good or bad news affected the value of the dollar. You will not wonder about Bitcoin, because goods and services will be quoted and exchanged in Bitcoin, and the value to your household will not fluctuate rapidly.

### What is the best cryptocurrency out there and, why?

**Bitcoin** is the only viable long-term cryptocurrency. Others, like **Ethereum**, may survive or even flourish, but this is because they serve other markets, and are not trying to be simply money.

#### The reason that Bitcoin will not be dethroned as the future of money, is:

* *It has already achieved a ubiquitous two sided network in every country*
* *You may recall that VHS video format overtook the momentum of Betamax. But this won’t happen with Bitcoin. That’s because VHS and Betamax had competing proprietary technologies and each came with a minefield of licensing fees and requirements. Eventually, the market chose the one with the lowest cost and fewest encumbrances. Bit Bitcoin is different. It is free to steal any clever innovations demonstrated by altcoins and then add the features into Bitcoin itself. In this field, there are no proprietary ideas, licensing requirements or secrets.*

Developers that I work with view every altcoin as a beta test platform for Bitcoin. Any improvement, new feature or clever innovation can be backed into Bitcoin. It’s a messy exercise in democracy, but ultimate, it only requires that the new code is accepted by a majority of miners — or championed by rising user awareness.

### Do you think ETFs will be possible?

Sure. This will happen. Some government bodies will be against it and some will be for it. But either way, it is fait accompli. Eventually, every country will be dragged into the party. In any democracy or capitalist country, there is no reasonable basis for government or regulators to forbid citizens from creating securities out of any commodity or asset. Cryptocurrencies do not present any unique issues for brokers and traditional exchanges. They can be easily securitized or partitioned into derivatives. Sure, some of these instruments will amplify risk, but in the end, the public will create and market whatever instruments they wish.

### Do you think decentralization will be inevitable and, why?

Yes. Decentralization is inevitable, because it addresses the goal of fairness, accountability and capitalism. It has always been a viable solution, but without a mechanism to enable applications.

Trust built on decentralized consensus (especially money) creates a fair, transparent, fluid network. It keeps governments honest.

Contrary to early pundits, decentralized cryptocurrency does not lessen a government’s ability to tax, spend or enforce tax collection. Additionally, it does not facilitate crime. These are early myths from analysts who did not fully understand or appreciate the blockchain.

But, cryptocurrency will certainly change the social contract between a government, its citizens and its creditors. Walls will come tumbling down, and this benefits everyone.

### Do you think we are making history and, why?

Yes indeed. Just like the steam hammer, the telephone, the internal combustion engine, the transistor and the internet, our grandchildren will look back on the 20-teens and 2020s, and ask what it was like to witness a revolution is real time. The advent of cryptocurrency is a bit harder to grasp at first. But it is just as transformative; just as beneficial; just as important to our future.

### Can you name some of the projects who will have huge impact in society and, why?

Voting, Real estate (deeds, transfers, liens), contracts, multisig consensus (related to anything), peer review (in any field), medicine, genetics, law (adjudication &amp; arbitration), sports (scoring and consensus) — and hundreds of fields that we cannot yet imagine.

### What advice can you give to the people who are starting their own project on the blockchain?

Keep your eye on the fundamental things that make the blockchain credible and beneficial. That is, Be very skeptical of any implementation that is not:

* *permissionless*
* *open source*
* *without any licensing or legal restrictions*
* *fully accountable genesis period*
* *based on a trusted, recognized, vetted blockchain code with a lineage that is directly traceable to Satoshi’s 2009 whitepaper*
* *without the slightest hint of airdrops, MLM or referral fees, or any marketing behavior that smacks of these things*

If you are involved in a project that uses a new coin or token, ask yourself if the problem could be addressed by Bitcoin or Ethereum. If so, why bother with the new coin? It certainly cannot be as fair, transparent, vetted and scalable.

### Where should people start when they want to begin to learn how blockchain works?

* *Any novice should begin by using Google. Search blockchain introduction OR blockchain for beginners OR how does a blockchain work?*
* *Here is a list of blockchain courses, including Blockchain Basics. Many are online:* [*https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=blockchain*](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=blockchain)
* *In this article, I mention terrific table of free blockchain courses:* [*http://awildduck.com/?p=4846*](http://awildduck.com/?p=4846)

### What resources can you share with us, besides the ones that you already share?

I write a lot of articles about the revolution under our feet. With irreverent modesty, I refer you to my own articles:

• **WildDuck** I write under the pen name, “Ellery” \[[View articles](http://awildduck.com/?cat=80)\]

**• LinkedIn** Blockchain columnist: Dozens of [published articles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philraymond/detail/recent-activity/posts/). Additionally,

**• Lifeboat** Board member, Columnist \[[View articles](http://lifeboat.com/blog/author/phil-raymond)\]

**• Quora** Most active author Bitcoin &amp; blockchain \[[1000 articles](http://awildduck.com/quora) as “Ellery”\]

• **Sophos** Bitcoin wallet security \[[View article](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/01/23/bitcoin-wallets-how-to-protect-your-digital-currency/)\]

### What is the next milestone to the blockchain?

In the past few months, we have seen the gradual roll out of Lightning Network. It successfully addressed critical infrastructure problems associated with of transaction speed, cost, and other issues affecting scalability.

There are several minor issues to be addressed, mostly related to security, malleability, and testability. But I am most interested in two long term issues that must eventually be addressed:

#### 1. Energy Consumption Caused by Proof of Work

The blockchain is the engine of Bitcoin and all other fair cryptocurrencies. Currently, Bitcoin’s blockchain is based on a distributed consensus mechanism called Proof of Work \[POW\]. It is fair, but it is very expensive. If solar power and other cheap energy sources spread across the world, the economics of POW guarantee that all the new, inexpensive energy will be diverted into mining and will not free humanity from fossil fuels and massive cash payments across borders.

We must replace the current Proof-of-Work mechanism with one that does not suck up every available kilowatt. Currently, POW is the scalability elephant in the room. Other cryptocurrencies have introduced alternate consensus mechanisms, but, in my opinion, they are either centralized or unfair.

**Fortunately, other fair, distributed consensus mechanisms are on the horizon. You can read more about it here:**

* [*Distributed Consensus: Beyond POW or POS*](http://awildduck.com/?p=4663)
* [*Blockchain Scalability; Proof of Work –vs- BFT Replication*](http://awildduck.com/?p=4645)

#### 2. Dwindling of Mining Rewards and the Alignment of Goals

Every user must eventually become a miner. This will align the interests of stakeholders, incentive validators (what is now called miners), and enhance Satoshi’s vision of a fair, decentralized system of accounting and consensus.

### What motivates you?

I am very fortunate to have discovered a calling and a career that fires my passion in every way. I recognized the importance of the blockchain and Bitcoin very early, and as an amateur writer, I realized that I could dispel myths that were bound to arise. The biggest myths about cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, are:

* *It is a bubble — just like 16th century Tulip mania*
* *Nothing tangible backs it*
* *It facilitates criminal activity*
* *Governments won’t allow it*
* *It enables tax cheating*
* *It is deflationary, and this stifles economic growth (or leads to war, unemployment, recession, or planter’s warts!)*

Absolutely none of this is true. But it makes for great press and it leads to a state of fear, which helps to mislead the public. I try hard to counter such misunderstanding and irrational fear in my articles, presentations and consulting.

### What’s your definition of success?

#### Cryptocurrency transactions fall into two classes:

**1.** Transactions driven by money exchange or investment (speculators, hoarders, day traders)

**2**. Transactions driven by commerce (purchases, sales, debt settlement, staff salaries, interbank transfers, bonding shipments).

Today, the first category accounts for **95%** or more of all **Bitcoin** transactions.

The first stage of “success” will be the time at which the fraction of Bitcoin transactions in Category 2 exceeds those in Category one. This will be the day that Bitcoin stops fluctuating and becomes a serious economic instrument.

Later a 2nd success will arrive when citizens of the world begin to shift their accumulated wealth and credit from legacy, national currencies to Bitcoin.

### What you think of work/life balance?

With any career or project, there is always a risk of abandoning family responsibilities or the need to relax. I find my work to be both rewarding and relaxing (my career in cryptocurrencies and blockchain). But, I still spend more than half of my time with family and friends. For me, the balance is crucial to leading a fulfilling life.

Many of these friends are interested in the same things as me, and i always try to learn from those with different interests and skills.

### What is the best advice you can give to the people who are reading this?

Don’t get sucked into ICOs. They are scams

More about this:

**(a)** [Is every ICOs a scam?](http://awildduck.com/?p=5249)

**(b)** [ICOs &amp; altcoins rise and fall, but Bitcoin endures](http://awildduck.com/?p=5192)

* Don’t think of Bitcoin as just an investment. Accept it in business and avoid converting all revenues into fiat.
* Retain some cryptocurrency so that you can use it to purchase materials, pay staff and settle debts. Look for vendors that make it easy to pay with Bitcoin. Keep it circulating! If it does not achieve significantly more adoption (at least as a payment instrument — but more critically as a currency), then your nest egg will never provide you with security. Use it! Keep it circulating.

My bitcoin trip so far. Starting from dec 2017 discussion,"I heard about bitcoin about 5 years ago thanks to reddit. I unfortunately was not interested in it so i did not really look into what it was, nor did i have any extra money at the time due to being in my last years of college. So then for some reason in December of last year 2017 i started to wonder what is this bitcoin thing i keep seeing on reddit? I started to read about it, i started to follow the price, and it really sparked my interest for several reasons. First off i believe with the internet, technology advancement, and travel advances the world is becoming smaller and people are becoming more connected. Ive always thought that some sort of global/internet currency would eventually come along, however before december 2017 i did not know that's kind of what bitcoin is. Another reason i was interested is becuase ive always felt like my home computer could be working/doing something while i am not using it and ideally it would pay you. And finally something that is decentralized and not controled by a company or government is an amazing idea. I trust a computer system more then i trust human greed.
     So in November/December 2017 i spent about 3 weeks learning about bitcoin and watching the price sky rocket. Ive never invested in a stock or anything like this. I knew bitcoin was in a bubble. But who knew how long before that bubble pops. All the price charts showed nothing but growth over the last few year to months to weeks. After finding out what bitcoin was and how it appealed to me on a personal level i was very antsy to get some skin in the game. So i waited... i waited untill the all time high hit of 19500ish and then i waited until it crashed to 16000. I thought this was the bubble bursting. I bought in at 16000 excited about what the future could bring. 
    Well as we all know, that was not the crash. The crash happend immediately after that. After investing my money i got to watch as the price of bitcoin went all the way down to 6000 within 2 weeks of me buying in.. It sucked but at no point did that make me want to sell my bitcoin. I still believed in the system and what it has to offer. I continue to watch the bitcoin news and price. Even tho i have no intention of selling i still check the price daily. Ive watched the price slide down for 8 months. A few months ago i started to reconize patterns and ive been able to very accurate predict the market for the last 3 months. Now is an exciting time becuase for the first time in 3 months i dont know what to expect from bitcoin. I believe we are close to the floor and its exciting to be in unfamiliar territory. Price goes up, price goes down, doesnt really matter to me but its exciting to me because it feels new and unfamiliar.
       A few months after i bought in on december i was researching bitcoin and started to become intersted in mining and helping secure the system for another way to obtain a piece of the pie. I understand bitcoin is getting more rare as time goes on and i want to accumulate more. I also really like the idea of my computer helping and contributing to the system i so very much believe in and it was also going to provide me with a small payout. So i started mining using my old desktop. It was old and obviously couldnt help the bitcoin system because it was old and week. So i mined anything i could to see if it actually worked. And it did. I was making a whole 15 cent a day. Hell yea! Thats like 1$ a week! So after a 2 or 3 weeks of doing this and actually getting a payout that was then transfered to my bitcoin account and then i had more bitcoin. I was sold. I loved it. I then invested a bit more money and built a new top end desktop. I Got 2 high end video cards to help me mine and game. My 15 cent a day was now about 5$ a day. A few months after making about 5$ a day (rough estimate) i started to think about my old desktop. I still had my old desktop which was now sitting and doing nothing. I went ahead and spent a bit more money to upgrade my old desktop and put 2 more video cards in it. So now i have 2 rather high end desktops mining bitcoin for me. 
     Over the course of the next 5 months ive been mining when i am not using my computers. Ive been able to bring down my buy in price from the initial 16000 to about 12000 now. I am still down about 50% of my money but i do not plan on selling. I understand how the bitcoin system is designed. I understand supply and demand fundamentals and i believe the bitcoin price will be higher in the future then it is right now. But price a side i truely believe in the bitcoin system and what it has to offer.
      Since ive learned about bitcoin i have explained and helped 6 people to invest in bitcoin. I have tried to help clarify what bitcoin is to many more. I am excited to say i recently met someone who thought bitcoin was a ponzi scheme or made up and worth nothing. I understand this might be a thought from someone who doesnt know or understand bitcoin. It was a blast talking to a denier and clearing up a lot of there misconception of bitcoin.
       I get a lot of questions about bitcoin. The biggest one being, what is bitcoin? A lot of people have heard the name bitcoin but they have no idea what it is. This can be a difficult question to answer depending on the person your speaking to and how technically savy they are. 

       How i explain bitcoin to an average joe who only has a minute or two to grasp the idea is exacly like this:

What is bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a piece of software that is a form of banking. The bitcoin system instead of using money it uses bitcoin. The system allows you to send and receive bitcoin in a very secure system that can not be altered. This system is also decentralized, meaning no one owns it. Its not ran by a company or a government and there for has less reliance on outside systems or governments. Its simply a piece of computer software. It was programmed/designed to do something and thats exacly what it does, and it doesnt matter if your in US, china, or anywhere else, bitcoin system is going to do exacly what it was programmed to do. Now bitcoin themself are the components inside of the system that get sent from place to place, instead of using local fiat like your bank does the bitcoin system uses bitcoin. These bitcoin can be bought and sold on an exchange which in turn makes them act similarly to a stock. So in a wierd way bitcoin is a banking system which also acts similarly to a stock market. I personally believe in the bitcoin system because its a computer code thats going to act exacly how it was programmed to act. It does a similar thing to our banking system except its not subject to the high costs and overhead of our current banking system such as payibg for bank buildings, employee salaries, or human greed. Therefore to me its a banking system without as much overhead which means the system can be much cheaper to use and interact with then our current system. So even if you don't buy into the idea of Bitcoin, Isn't it nice knowing that if you don't agree with what your government is doing with its currency that there is atleast an alternative choice in a banking/currency system?

Anyways i wrote this because i was hoping to spark some bitcoin conversation. Please comment. Tell me how much you can relate to my story, or tell me how you describe bitcoin to people who ask, or just chime in to tell me how stupid i am for buying when i did. I love bitcoin and just want to talk bitcoin with fellow enthusiasts. Feel free to ask me any questions your interested in aswell.",1534173133,13/08/2018 15:12:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/96z3qs/my_bitcoin_trip_so_far_starting_from_dec_2017/,1

PSA: Buy Something Using Bitcoin this Month,"If you plan on cashing out your BTC, don’t exchange it, buy something! First and foremost Bitcoin is a currency. Part of the reason the price is so fluid is because Bitcoin is predominantly speculation. That’s bad for the market! Even if you’re holding and nothing will convince you otherwise, buy a little something, anything, using Bitcoin once a moth. We need to take Bitcoin back from the speculators and keep it moving as a global currency! We are much more powerful when we use Bitcoin than when we speculate how useful it could be!

Proof that bitcoin is worthless,"1. If you had a New Method of doing something, which leaves out the crucial element X, that would be a worthless method. (For example, a new way to boil an egg, which doesn't mention boiling eggs at all.)
2. If you asked people on the street why the dollar has value, most wouldn't know. So, not understanding money is the norm with human beings.

When you put these 2 facts together, it is very likely that bitcoiners have misunderstood money, and thus created a New Money in which they forgot to include a crucial element X. Thus their supposed new money is actually worth $00.00.",1534185983,13/08/2018 18:46:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/970yw3/proof_that_bitcoin_is_worthless/,1

stolen bitcoins recovery now possible," An uptick in digital heists of virtual currencies has left many crypto investors wondering if they have any options for tracing illicit Bitcoin transactions and recovering their stolen funds. The short answer is that ‘it’s possible, but difficult.’ The long answer is that ongoing developments in the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency may offer victims more recourse going forward.

Those who have fallen victim to crypto-currency heists either through mismanaged exchanges or hacks have the option of filing a complaint with the FBI’s Cyber Criminal Unit or other law enforcement agencies. An obstacle in going this route is the lack of emphasis placed on recovering stolen Bitcoin; to date, no one has received jail time for hacking an exchange or electronically syphoning digital currency. Broadly speaking, law enforcement agencies remain undecided as to whether or not stealing digital currency constitutes a crime but the good news is that their are individuals and agencies out there that do a good job with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency recovery, infact i did not believe this to be true till michael veksler recovered some bitcoins stolen from my PC, and the whole process was simple and fast.",1534190921,13/08/2018 20:08:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/971otf/stolen_bitcoins_recovery_now_possible/,1

Biblical study: Revelations on Bitcoin,"Hello all, I have just begun to study Revelations in search of Bitcoin signs. Admittedly, I don't know much about the book, and I'm just using Bitcoin as an excuse to read it. I will be working on my knowledge and posting more information as I come across it. I'm keeping it simple for this post. Revelations is a Biblical book of prophecy.

I have read **Revelations 3:18**: 
&gt;""I [the Holy Spirit] counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint you eyes with eye salves, that you may see.""

To me that means we should:
*own bitcoin outright (buy gold refined in the fire)
*exchange it for goods (clothes)
*understand it (anoint you eyes with eye salves)

Own it, trade it, understand it. This is the counsel of the Holy Spirit.

Why bitcoin cannot beat the banks. And will only result in greater wealth disparity.,"Central Banks around the world create all of the money. All of it. Some will say that in places like the US, they give all their profits (which totaled roughly $100 billion on paper) to the treasury. Which isn’t true considering the Fed pays out 6% dividends every year to its shareholders, which happen to be commercial banks. And not as if the treasury is any better considering the government places people like the ex ceo of Goldman Sachs in charge of the treasury (sounds crazy right? Well, it happened right after the financial collapse of 2008..which the banks caused. Yet, treasury turns around and bails out banks for hundreds of billions). If you were to go and read the last independent audit of the us treasury...it specifically states that all “investments in commercial entities are not published or recorded as assets or liabilities because they cannot be accurately measured”. Anyway, i digress. The fact of the matter is that central banks have all the power, they can create money at will, and they are quite literally above the law. 

If one goes further up the chain to the Bank of International Settlements, they have been given status above the law in clear writing, signed by over 60 nations. They act as the clearinghouse for every central bank in the world, and possess the largest amount of private currency reserves and gold in the world. They aren’t part of any nation, they pay no taxes, they aren’t regulated, their members and the bank have civil and criminal immunity worldwide, their assets can’t be seized or audited, nor is any government official even allowed to step foot on their land. Yes, this is all factual. Signed off by every country except North Korea and Iran and a few small ones. Last month they moved around 487 tons of gold in the currency markets. For who or why is anyone’s guess. However, they were content to stay in the shadows since 1930, and only came out making public statements when crypto got popular. They have essentially declared open war on crypto. I suppose i should also note that the BIS is owned by the central banks. Giving them a place to conduct international money movements free from any oversight or regulation. 

So given all that, what is to stop them from essentially buying the entire crypto market just to crash it and destroy it? 200 billion is nothing to them. A drop in the bucket. Especially when you are made up of 60 banks that all have exclusive rights to create money. There was nothing but good news a week and a half ago. And a few days before the expected ETF approval, all of a sudden there is aggressive, unstoppable and relentless selling into every major crypto market. This wasn’t investors. Not retail. Not institutional. Someone repeatedly market selling orders of 1000 eth, 800 eth into a market that is buying them up, is only one thing. An entity that has the ability to keep selling until it has exhausted and worn out every last buyer. 

Crypto started crashing again for one reason. The group that has a total monopoly on the creation of currency wants to keep it that way. 

For a crypto to ever succeed in freeing the people from banks, it is going to have to be created and distributed without fiat being required for adoption. How that would be done; is a matter that would require great care in its development and coordination in deployment. And discretion up until that point. Is it possible? I don’t know. But it’s worth beginning to think about. ",1534196402,13/08/2018 21:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/972gf8/why_bitcoin_cannot_beat_the_banks_and_will_only/,1

How do you know if you’re right?,"[ ](https://i.redd.it/3cjz2hfkoxf11.jpg)

Over the last couple of years I became more and more fascinated with the blockchain/cryptocurrencies.  
 

While talking to enthousiasts, sceptics and people that knew nothing about the technology, I realised that the learning curve towards understanding what’s going on was pretty high.   


So I challenged myself. My goal was to be able to have a 2 hour conversation with somebody that has never heard of the blockchain and make them at least have a basic understanding of it. Family, friends, colleagues, random people…everybody got a piece of my mind about the blockchain.   
 

I often got stuck when trying to simplify it or when they’d ask me follow up after follow up questions. However, the only thing it did was fuel my brain to research and simplify it even more.  
 

As time moved on I’d like to believe I got better and better at explaining it. That’s why I decided to write it all down and have the internet drag it down the dirt.   
 

So how do you know if you’re right?  
The way I know to be right is to have as many people challenge your thoughts through feedback and constructive arguments. Hopefully we can all learn from each other and come out smarter on the other side!   
  

Here is the intro post about why learning about the blockchain is useful:

Bitcoin Price/NVT Ratio Comparison,"Here is an up-to-date look at Bitcoin's NVT ratio for all of Samsa's traders. By comparing each month's average market cap to its transaction volumes (in $USD), we can see that we are over the average NVT by a wide margin currently.

https://i.redd.it/o82opnk0sxf11.png

We ideally want to see the NVT ratio fall below its average, which we haven't seen since early January. This is when we typically see the large upswing bursts in Bitcoin's price.

There are obviously exceptions, but this chart generally indicates fairly accurately whether Bitcoin is currently overvalued or undervalued from a transactional perspective.

https://i.redd.it/41vmcs82sxf11.png

https://i.redd.it/mho7v092sxf11.png

How to read these NVT charts:   
\-Blue transparent bars show the average price of BTC for the given month  
\-Solid yellow line shows the average NVT over time  
\-Multicolored area chart shows the actual average NVT of each month.

We want to see NVT fall under the yellow line and be in the yellow-green/green range.

How MtGox could start WWIII,"It is widely thought that Alexander Vinnick holds the keys to some of the stolen 600,000 MtGox bitcoins. Vinnick is awaiting extradition to one of three nations-- France Russia and the US. There is tremendous pressure from Russia to extradite him for a flimsy old $9400 fraud charge. The Russians, of course, are drooling over the possibility of extracting from Vinnick the keys  to the stolen $3.5 billion MtGox coins in exchange for leniency.

How could this spiral into war? 

1. Russian oligarchs gain possession of the 600,000 bitcoins belonging to MtGox creditors.

2. US and other western nations file claims under international law for return of recovered stolen assets.

3. Russians refuse claim.

4. US Federal court orders $3.5 billion in Russian held US Treasuries seized for distribution to MtGox creditors.

5. Russia seizes $3 billion in US assets held in Russia.

6. US threatens isolation of Russia from the banking system.

6. In the past Russia has threatened to use nuclear weapons if its Visa/Mastercard payment network was disconnected from the world banking system. They reiterate the threat.

7. President Trump threatens a pre-emptive nuclear strike if any nation uses threats of nuclear war  to gain economic or financial leverage in deplomacy.

8. US orders Visa/Mastercard out of Russia.

9. All 11 Russian ballistic missile submarines, mistakenly thought to be invisible to the US Navy, are simultaneously destroyed.

.com era vs Bitcoin vs alts,"Everyone has been comparing the .com era to the cryptocurrency era the past 8 months. I think everyone was right.

Bitcoin dominance has been steadily climbing the past month while every single alt has been tanking. During the .com era everything that advertised with a .com rose in price exactly like any project with a blockchain did the same the past 10 months.

I think the market is finally correcting itself, investors are finally understanding that just because something has a blockchain doesn't mean that it's going to be revolutionary. They're acting accordingly. 

The entire purpose Blockchain was created was for a new global currency aka Bitcoin. All the alts are solutions that are looking for problems. There aren't many problems to solve with blockchain besides money. Simply look at dAPPs, compare Google play and the Apple app store to any ""decentralized"" blockchain and you'll see that there isn't any reason for people to switch to dAPPs.

It's only my opinion but I think people trying to predict the next alt run are in for a world of hurt. It's not going to come and you're going to be caught with your pants down.

It's Bitcoin not blockchain. The market is finally realizing this. The final nail in the coffin may be when Bitcoin goes on a run without anything following it. Buy Bitcoin.

Anonymizing bitcoins,"Hi I am planning to buy some bitcoins with credit card. After that I need to detach my identity from those bitcoins because I will expose my identity while using a payment card. I know that there are mixer. Is it the best option to do that? 

What is the most secure services where I can buy bitcoins using credit card?

Also I am planning to use bitcoin core client for all operations running through TOR with random MAC address on my PC which will be connected to public WiFi hot spot. 

My plan is:

1. buy bitcoin with card
2. send bitcoins to my own address created in bitcoin core client
3. send bitcoins to mixer and receive to my another address
4. Now I have bitcoins detached from my identity and I can send them somewhere using bitcoin core running through tor on public network and with random MAC address on PC so I won't expose my IP, real MAC address etc.

Is it enough to totally anonymize bitcoins?

Support it,"Bitcoin (BTC) now accounts for 50% of the market value of the entire cryptocurrency. At around 03:00 on August 11, CoinMarketCap's bitcoin market share, which tracks the percentage of the leading cryptocurrency in the total cryptocurrency market, reached 50% for the first time since December 19, 2017. As of now, the market value of Bitcoin is currently $105,785,552,545, which is about $901 million higher than the total market value of all other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s market share has steadily increased over the past few months and is currently up 14% from May 1. During the same period, the market dominance of all other cryptocurrencies was basically declining. When the market share of Bitcoin last exceeded 50%, the situation was very different. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, on December 19th, the average price of the exchange's BTC was $17,605.81 - 65% higher than today's cryptocurrency price.

Am I selling now? No way. Why not?,"Because Bitcoin is not broken.  Nothing bad happened to Bitcoin.  It still works.  It's still the same Bitcoin it was a few months ago, in fact, it's even better now.  It is still ""going to the moon"" same as it ever was.

Did the central banks get together and fix fiat currencies?  Did governments around the world suddenly decide to stop spending more than they collect?  No way.  So, Bitcoin is still ""going to the moon"".

Will there be bumps along the way?  What do you think we're experiencing now? At this time, some of get to decide: are you going to be a coward, or not?  Nothing wrong with being a coward, if that's what you want to be, if you want to get old, look back and say, ""Yeah, I was a big, fucking chicken, and I shit my pants...and missed out..."". On the other hand, if you choose to stick it out, to be patient, to know that you've invested in the best thing that will ever be invented in your entire life, then your entire perspective will change -- the way you see money, investments, life...  You'll grow in certain ways and you will have that for the rest of your life.

The way things are looking, the scam known as Tether might surpass Bitcoin. It’s hard for you to fathom this concept being that Bitcoin continues to eat up the market during these bearish times. But when the crypto market resurfaces, Bitcoin will learn that you can’t be God forever.

A domino has fallen,"A domino has fallen - the Turkish lira. The next victim of fiat decline. Central banks have run out of tools. More government currencies will continue to collapse. US dollar will grow stronger for a while, but ultimately will fall as well. What will people in the countries of fallen currencies do with their hyper-inflating paper money? Gold? Silver? Bitcoin?

Fellow hodlers, global Bitcoin adoption seems inevitable to me - its only a matter of time before these governments lose control of their currencies. The outstanding national debts are way too high, and the only way to pay this off is to print more and more money. Eventually, we will need a new global standard.

I honestly hope the Bitcoin price falls in the short term so I can collect me some Satoshis on the cheap. If you want some hopium in these down times, consider how much Bitcoin has grown compared to the “market cap” of national currencies. It’s long slow growth thats been going on for a decade. I actually think that, as government currencies continue to fail, most people will flee to gold/silver before moving to Bitcoin. I’m personally preparing for this lull in price to continue all the way until 2020 - similar to the depression length after the late 2013 Bitcoin boom and bust (check out this chart: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)).

BTC DOMINANCE much bigger than the stat.,"Prices for alt coins are considered by their last trade value and do not consider liquidity  at all.  So if the bottom 2000 coins which will not hold up against selling pressure are thrown into the mix it's really not a fair comparison.

BTC dominance should be measured against the top 50 coins only and not all 5000 or whatever shitcoins are out there.

My idea to speed up crypto adoption.,"What if they create a terminal where the customer doesn't even need a cryptocurrency. The merchant asks the customer if he or she wants to pay in cash, visa, or Bitcoin or the merchant accepts crypto becasue of lower fees. The customer swipes there card imediately the terminal buys Bitcoin say and then uses the bitcoin to make the purchase. The customer gets two receipts, one for the crypto which was entirely used for the purchase and another receipt for the purchased product they bought. Of course this would be done to avoid cryptocurrencies wild swings and also have people using crypto who never would.

LEOOY - let everything be simple,"The existing traditional OTA platform is a trading platform that consumers mainly rely on. Since the blockchain is applied to the tourism industry, blockchain technology is the first blockchain technology platform in China, LEOOY, which is expected to exist in the traditional OTA platform. On the basis of this, the business process of tourist hotels, travel agencies, scenic spots and other tickets will be simplified.

https://i.redd.it/iae6vntmy0g11.png

**Identity verification - simplify the certification process**

We now need to fill in the ID card information when making a hotel reservation on the OTA website. After going to the hotel, we will also get an ID card. When the travel agency chooses the service, we also need to show the ID card, but LEOOY can carry out the information of the participants in the identity authentication. After encryption, the LEOOY pass is used for verification. In order to prevent the service provider from revealing the identity information of the consumer, in the process of booking the hotel or other services, it is not necessary to present the ID card over and over again to simplify the authentication process.

*Processing img eea3541ly0g11...*

**Remove the middleman - simplify the transaction process**

Among the blockchain tourism technology platforms, the most commendable is its “decentralization” feature. The tourism industry is hiring commissions from third-party intermediary platforms, whether it is hotels, scenic spots or travel agencies, because of the pressure to reduce agency costs. A series of inappropriate marketing methods, various hidden terms in the transaction process, led to many contradictions with consumers. In LEOOY, there is no middleman, the service provider and the consumer are peer-to-peer transactions, and the consumers pay directly to the service provider, minus the cost pressure of the service provider, and avoid the docking with the third sub-intermediary platform. All the cumbersome processes that lead to it.

*Processing img oy2t82ijy0g11...*

**Smart contracts - streamline the contract process**

Travel agencies currently rely on paper contracts or online terms to determine the content of services with consumers. After entering the blockchain tourism era, smart contracts store the terms of service in blocks in the form of computer code. The platform relies on intelligence. The contract is automatically executed, eliminating the formalities for service providers and consumers to sign contract terms and service

*Processing img fczd7nogy0g11...*

**Information disclosure, community autonomy - simplify dispute handling process.**

Now that we are buying high-priced tickets, we are not satisfied with the hotel or travel agency services, but we can only seek the help of the government regulatory authorities when we are not able to deal with them, or we must go directly to the legal proceedings, which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. In the event of a transaction dispute, LEOOY can appeal to the community, and then directly have high-quality members of the Arbitration Committee to vote to resolve the dispute, which can ensure the fairness and justice of the processing results, and can greatly simplify the processing.

*Processing img f9tmpgooy0g11...*

Based on the above advantages, if we choose blockchain tourism, choose LEOOY. As a participant, if you want to make a hotel reservation, choose a travel agency or a scenic spot service on the platform, you only need to verify the identity information of the platform, hold the LEOOY pass, directly Connect with the service provider and enjoy the joy of the journey, because we believe that we can do everything simple.

Stopping my business to accept Crypto,"I am running an online business and decided to accept btc a while ago. I wasnt going to hold just cash them out as soon I get them to keep the business running. I thought it would be easy no fees not getting scammed charges back payments cc stolen full control etc. I decided to stop since I am literally paying double or even triples fees on btc not only to cash them out but the price goes down so quickly that by the time I get them and put them on the exchange I lose 5/10% on the value. I am reporting losses on all crypto payments and trust me I am usually quick on cash them out.. max 48hrs. Crypto no more. Now I am so happy when I get payments with PayPal and normal cc. I pay a standard fee and I know for sure how much I'll get. Crypto too much headache I am literally gambling on the sale. Mass adoption my ass.

[UK] How to buy less than £1000 of Bitcoin via Debit card without KYC/AML,"First things first.. 

Stopping terrorists and criminals from buying Bitcoin is essential for society and for Bitcoin itself. So this post is NOT about providing a service for these scumbags.

However if you read the UK law on KYC/AML it clearly states this only has to be done on purchases over £1000, so all the exchanges such as Coinbase etc who make you do ID verification on amounts less than this, saying it is a KYC/AML requirements, are talking nonsense.

So if you are from the UK (and possibly Europe) then you should be aware that you can buy less than £1000 worth of Bitcoin from the following sites without having to upload any ID verification documents. All you need to do is provide a valid UK mobile number and use debit/card card.

Please note that most have daily limits, and that the £1000 (or less) limit is a yearly limit, which resets after 12 months.

It’s over boys. Pack it up!," *I’ve been supporting bitcoin since 2014 and haven’t been scared off by the dips in the past. I’m not trying to scare anyone to sell, just trying to inform people that bitcoin isn’t what it used to be. 


I really want a discussion about this; not people shouting at me in the comment because they don’t agree.

It isn’t going anywhere. The price could change ± $1,500 but that’s it.  
Here’s my reasons: 



The prices was blown up by the media after $13,000 that lead people to believe they’re missing out on getting rich.

Bitcoin needed business to adopt bitcoin but they haven’t. 

People aren’t being paid in it. 

Bitcoin was originally made to be a secure and anonymous currency however it’s being used as an investment tool. 

Nearly everyone who wants to buy anything with bitcoin has to exchange it to $£€.


It relies on intermediaries which leads to higher fees.


The media frenzy and adoption was the perfect storm for bitcoin to flourish and be accepted by business physical and online but it hasn’t happened but this didn’t happen.
Yes. You have the few large company that allows their customers to pay with it but it’s either a marketing tactic or temporary (because it’s not suitable for companies as the price is too sensitive) that’s why I believe it’s not going anywhere. 

At the end of the day the same people that pushed the price up don’t care anymore.

Work Product of InvestInBlockchain," InvestInBlockchain is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency news and alt-coin analysis sites

Considering that blockchain projects are open-source, building a basic blockchain and launching it isn’t a very high bar to set. 

When researching this article, we evaluated each project’s status, looked at its roadmap, checked its release history, and compared completed features to what the team promises to deliver in the future.

A working product is active and available to the public. Its mainnet has likely been released for some time, bumping the version numbers well above 1.0. Businesses and individuals use it on a daily basis for dapps, smart contracts, or digital currency transactions.

In other words, the mere existence of a product does not necessarily mean that the product is working. After all, is a foundation really doing any work when there is no weight on top of it? Likewise, a dapp platform that has a mainnet but that doesn’t have any noteworthy dapps on top of it isn’t considered “working” by this criteria.

Unpopular opinion: I hope the bear market continues for some time.,"No, I'm not crazy... and yes, I do hodl and actually bought more not long ago, so higher than today. But I still hope the bear market continues for a while. 

Two reasons stand out. There are still too many shitcoins that are valued at $1bn+ market cap. All that is nothing but hype, and should be further shaken off. 

But the most important reason is high market prices made attacking Bitcoin MUCH easier. If 1 SHC (SCH = SHitCoin) buys you 1 month of shilling and propaganda, and you have 10,000+ SHC, that's a fuckton of shilling a propaganda. But if 1 SHC only buys you one day of shilling and propaganda, you'll run out of shitcoins VERy fast. And if you want to continue with shilling and propaganda, you'll need to do an ISO (Initial Shitcoin Offering) or an IPO. Basically, you need to find someone to sell your fucking bags to. And selling heavy bags is **MUCH** more difficult in a bear market, when the bulls are out in force it's easy to convince yourself that the bags are full of gold when they are really full of shit.

&amp;nbsp;

Bitcoin is fine. Long live the bear market.

Do you use cryptocurrencies frequently? Are they useful?,"Hi everyone,

This and other questions are part of a questionnaire that we, a research team from the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) are doing. It seeks to understand the drivers' usage of cryptocurrencies by the end user such as you and me. Considering 10 different dimensions, from perceived usefulness to privacy to profitability, among others. 

It takes on average 3 minutes to answer.

Here is the link for the questionnaire: r/https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies_usage 

More details:

For this, it was created a questionnaire with Likert type scale questions. These dimensions will then be used to construct a model, based on the traditional Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed in 1989, and some others developed afterwards, but with more adapted to the cryptocurrencies ecosystem. Then it will be done some data analysis and compilation of results.

This questionnaire has some focus on the financial area, but this does not mean it is the most important. We know there are some other dimensions not being addresses in this questionnaire, such as decentralisation/government influence, that may be addressed in the future. 

After analysing and publishing the thesis and papers I will post on this forum with infographics and the most important conclusions of the study.

We believe that after knowing in detail what drives the population to cryptocurrencies adoption a door will be open to help knowing how this ecosystem should develop in the future.

We already published this questionnaire before but still need more answers to validade. 

There are no open questions, but you can post here or message me about this.

Thank you for your time! Best Regards,

The University Institute of Lisbon research team",1534258410,14/08/2018 14:53:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9790qe/do_you_use_cryptocurrencies_frequently_are_they/,1

To everyone rushing back into BTC from altcoins: What matters is that you learn why Bitcoin needs to be conservative in its development.,"Over the past year, the prevailing thought among many in the cryptocurrency communities is that bitcoin is not keeping up with other coins.  That somehow bitcoin was being intentionally crippled, or that the developers did not know what they were doing.  As we are seeing with the bitcoin dominance going up, that prevailing thought was wrong.  The coins who were supposedly going to kill bitcoin have been all but abandoned in many cases.  Many others are in the process of dying a slow death (which may take years to fully play out).  

To everyone who went heavy on these coins and sold all of their bitcoin, but are now coming back: Welcome back. We are glad to have you.  But before you pretend like everything is great with bitcoin again, it's important to realize _why_ you were wrong.  

But first let's go back a few years.  In 2015, I was a staunch big blocker.  I want to share a post made during this time that I initially downvoted.  (The reason I know this is because after a certain number of months/years, reddit does not let you change whether you upvoted/downvoted something). I downvoted it because it went against my biases which had already been built up around the scaling decision, and later I came back to this post after being referred to it again.  The 2015 version of me had only been in Bitcoin for 2 years, and was disillusioned with what I thought bitcoin was.   And not what it actually was, or what its limitations were.   The 2018 me now realizes why I was wrong, but back then I spent far too much time thinking I had it all figured out.  The post that I downvoted, is as relevant today as it ever was:

**A trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages or otherwise the rocket equation will eat your lunch... packing everyone in clown-car style into a trebuchet and hoping for success is right out.** 

&gt; A lot of people on Reddit think of Bitcoin primarily as a competitor to card payment networks. I think this is more than a little odd-- Bitcoin is a digital currency. Visa and the US dollar are not usually considered competitors, Mastercard and gold coins are not usually considered competitors. Bitcoin isn't a front end for something that provides credit, etc.

&gt;Never the less, some are mostly interested in Bitcoin for payments (not a new phenomenon)-- and are not so concerned about what are, in my view, Bitcoin's primary distinguishing values-- monetary sovereignty, censorship resistance, trust cost minimization, international accessibility/borderless operation, etc. (Or other areas we need to improve, like personal and commercial privacy) Instead some are very concerned about Bitcoin's competitive properties compared to legacy payment networks. ... And although consumer payments are only one small part of whole global space of money, ... money gains value from network effects, and so I would want all the ""payments only"" fans to love Bitcoin too, even if I didn't care about payments.

&gt;But what does it mean to be seriously competitive in that space? The existing payments solutions have huge deployed infrastructure and merchant adoption-- lets ignore that. What about capacity? Combined the major card networks are now doing something on the other of 5000 transactions per second on a year round average; and likely something on the order of 120,000 transactions per second on peak days.

&gt;The decentralized Bitcoin blockchain is globally shared broadcast medium-- probably the most insanely inefficient mode of communication ever devised by man. Yet, considering that, it has some impressive capacity. But relative to highly efficient non-decentralized networks, not so much. The issue is that in the basic Bitcoin system every node takes on the whole load of the system, that is how it achieves its monetary sovereignty, censorship resistance, trust cost minimization, etc. Adding nodes increases costs, but not capacity. Even the most reckless hopeful blocksize growth numbers don't come anywhere close to matching those TPS figures. And even if they did, card processing rates are rapidly increasing, especially as the developing world is brought into them-- a few more years of growth would have their traffic levels vastly beyond the Bitcoin figures again.

&gt;No amount of spin, inaccurately comparing a global broadcast consensus system to loading a webpage changes any of this.

&gt;So-- Does that mean that Bitcoin can't be a big winner as a payments technology? No. But to reach the kind of capacity required to serve the payments needs of the world we must work more intelligently.

&gt;From its very beginning Bitcoin was design to incorporate layers in secure ways through its smart contracting capability (What, do you think that was just put there so people could wax-philosophic about meaningless ""DAOs""?). In effect we will use the Bitcoin system as a highly accessible and perfectly trustworthy robotic judge and conduct most of our business outside of the court room-- but transact in such a way that if something goes wrong we have all the evidence and established agreements so we can be confident that the robotic court will make it right. (Geek sidebar: If this seems impossible, go read this old post on transaction cut-through)

&gt;This is possible precisely because of the core properties of Bitcoin. A censorable or reversible base system is not very suitable to build powerful upper layer transaction processing on top of... and if the underlying asset isn't sound, there is little point in transacting with it at all.

&gt;The science around Bitcoin is new and we don't know exactly where the breaking points are-- I hope we never discover them for sure-- we do know that at the current load levels the decentralization of the system has not improved as the users base has grown (and appear to have reduced substantially: even businesses are largely relying on third party processing for all their transactions; something we didn't expect early on).

&gt;There are many ways of layering Bitcoin, with varying levels of security, ease of implementation, capacity, etc. Ranging from the strongest-- bidirectional payment channels (often discussed as the 'lightning' system), which provide nearly equal security and anti-censorship while also adding instantaneous payments and improved privacy-- to the simplest, using centralized payment processors, which I believe are (in spite of my reflexive distaste for all things centralized) a perfectly reasonable thing to do for low value transactions, and can be highly cost efficient. Many of these approaches are competing with each other, and from that we gain a vibrant ecosystem with the strongest features.

&gt;Growing by layers is the gold standard for technological innovation. It's how we build our understanding of mathematics and the physical sciences, it's how we build our communications protocols and networks... Not to mention payment networks. Thus far a multi-staged approach has been an integral part of the design of rockets which have, from time to time, brought mankind to the moon.

&gt;Bitcoin does many unprecedented things, but this doesn't release it from physical reality or from the existence of engineering trade-offs. It is not acceptable, in the mad dash to fulfill a particular application set, to turn our backs on the fundamentals that make the Bitcoin currency valuable to begin with-- especially not when established forms in engineering already tell us the path to have our cake and eat it too-- harmoniously satisfying all the demands.

&gt;Before and beyond the layers, there are other things being done to improve capacity-- e.g. Bitcoin Core's capacity plan from December (see also: the FAQ) proposes some new improvements and inventions to nearly double the system's capacity while offsetting many of the costs and risks, in a fully backwards compatible way. ... but, at least for those who are focused on payments, no amount of simple changes really makes a difference; not in the way layered engineering does.

If you're made it this far and want to read more, or perhaps from a different perspective, here is another article which influenced me more recently by [Melik Manukyan](https://medium.com/@melik_87377/lightning-network-enables-unicast-transactions-in-bitcoin-lightning-is-bitcoins-tcp-ip-stack-8ec1d42c14f5)

**Lightning Network enables Unicast Transactions in Bitcoin. Lightning is Bitcoin’s TCP/IP stack.**

&gt;It has recently come to my attention that there is a great deal of confusion revolving around the Lightning Network within the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash communities, and to an extent, the greater cryptocurrency ecosystem. I’d like to share with you my thoughts on Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Lightning from a strictly networking background.

&gt;To better understand how blockchain and the lightning network work, we should take a step back from the rage-infused battlegrounds of Twitter and Reddit (no good comes from this 😛) and review the very network protocols and systems that power our Internet. I believe that there is a great wealth of knowledge to be gained in understanding how computer networks and the Internet work that can be applied to Bitcoin’s own scaling constraints. The three protocols I will be primarily focusing on in this article are Ethernet, IP, and TCP. By understanding how these protocols work, I feel that we will all be better equipped to answer the great ‘scaling’ question for Bitcoin and all blockchains alike. With that said, let’s get started.

&gt;In computer networking, the two most common forms of data transmission today are broadcast and unicast. There are many other forms such as anycast and multicast, but we won’t touch up on them in this article. Let’s first start by defining and understanding these data transmission forms.

&gt;Broadcast — a data transmission type where information is sent from one point on a network to all other points; one-to-all.

&gt;Diagram: Broadcast Data Transmission https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xbgXKepaeHZRqmHWsCb_qw.png

&gt;Unicast — a data transmission type where information is sent from one point on a network to another point; one-to-one.

&gt;Diagram: Unicast Data Transmission https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i18TOm6hT_h7UQ8cnt8U_Q.png

&gt;Based on our understanding of these types of data transmission forms, we very quickly discover that blockchain transactions resemble Broadcast-like forms of communication. When a transaction is made on the Bitcoin network, the transaction is communicated or broadcasted to all connected nodes on the network. In other words, for a transaction to exist or happen in Bitcoin, all nodes must receive and record this transaction. Transactions on blockchains work very similarly to how legacy, ethernet hubs handled data transmissions.

&gt;A long time ago, we relied on ethernet hubs to transfer data between computers. Evidently, we discovered that they simply did not scale due to their limited nature. Old ethernet hubs strictly supported broadcast transmissions, data that would come in through one interface or port would need to be broadcasted and replicated out through all other interfaces or ports on the network. To help you visualize this, if you wanted to send me a 1MB image file over a network with 100 participants, that 1MB image file would, in turn, need to be replicated 99 times and broadcasted out to all other users on the network.

&gt;In Bitcoin, we see very similar behavior, data (a transaction or block) that comes from one node is broadcasted and replicated to all other nodes on the network. Blockchains similarly to old, legacy ethernet hubs are simply poor mediums to perform data transmission and communicate over. It is simply unrealistic to me as a network engineer to even consider scaling a global payment network such as Bitcoin via Broadcast-based on-chain transactions. Even to this very day, us network engineers take great care and caution in spanning our Ethernet and LAN networks, let alone on a global level.

&gt;To put it into perspective, if we were to redesign the Internet by strictly relying on broadcast data transmissions as exhibited in blockchains and ethernet hubs — we would have effectively put every single person, host, and device in the entire world on the same LAN segment or broadcast domain. The Internet would have been a giant, flat LAN network where all communication would need to be replicated and broadcasted to every single device. In you opening up to read this article, every other device on the Internet would have been forced to download this article. In other words, the internet would come to a screeching halt.

&gt;In computer networks, the most frequent form of communication relies on unicast data transmissions, or point-to-point. Most of the communication on the internet is routed from one computer to another, we no longer need to rely on blind broadcast transmissions of data with the hopes that our recipient will receive it or see it. We are able to accurately send, route and deliver our messages to our receiving party(ies). We learned that the transfer of a 1MB image file in a broadcast network would require the file to be replicated and broadcasted to every participant on that network. Instead, in a network that supports unicast data transmissions, we are able to appropriately route that image file from source to destination in a clearcut manner.

&gt;To me, the Lightning Network is the IP layer of Bitcoin. (I understand that these data transmission forms exist in both Ethernet and IP.) But, I do feel that these analogies help us to better understand these complex and largely abstract ideas: blockchain, lightning, channels, etc.

&gt;Let’s take a moment and ignore all explanations and overly simplistic definitions of Lightning that are perpetuated from both sides of the debate for a moment. Instead, lets objectively take a close look at Lightning and determine what we know. What do we know about lightning? It allows us to lock our Bitcoin and form channels with others. What else do we know? We can bidirectionally send and receive transactions between the two points that constitute the channel. What else do we know? We can further route transactions to their correct destination.

&gt;Based on these key understanding points, we are able to see that lightning enables unicast transactions in a system [Bitcoin] that previously only supported broadcast transactions. To me, Lightning nodes in Bitcoin are the equivalent of IP hosts — where we can finally conduct or route one-to-one or point-to-point transactions to their appropriate recipients. In traditional IP, we send and receive data packets; in Lightning, we send and receive Bitcoin. IP is what allowed us to scale our small and largely primitive networks of the past into the global giant that it is today, the Internet. In a similar manner, Lightning is what will allow us to scale our global Bitcoin network.

&gt;Where Lightning Nodes can be seen as IP hosts, I view Lightning Channels as established TCP connections. On the Internet today, when we try to connect to a website for example, we open a TCP connection to a web server through which we can then download the website’s HTML source code from. Alternatively, when we download a torrent file, we are opening TCP connections to other computers on the Internet which we then use to facilitate the transfer of the torrent data.

&gt;And in Lightning, we establish channels with our respective parties and are able to directly [point-to-point] send and receive data (transactions) similarly to TCP. Where Blockchain is similar to Ethernet, Lightning Nodes are our IPs and Lightning Channels our TCP connections.

&gt;To conclude, I see many similarities to our pre-existing network technologies and protocols that power our computer network(s) and I feel that we are redesigning the Internet. From a technical point of view, I don’t believe that scaling Bitcoin on-chain will ever work and fear broadcast storm-like events in the future. I welcome our new unicast transaction methods enabled by the Lightning Network. Even more so, I am excited for the ‘web’ moment in Bitcoin.

&gt;While everyone has their eyes fixed on blockchain technology, I look towards Lightning. Lightning is the TCP/IP stack of Bitcoin. Lightning is where we will transact on. Lightning is where everything will be built on. Lightning is what will power and enable our applications and additional protocols and layers. With this said, what is to become of the main Bitcoin blockchain? It will and should remain a decentralized, tamper-proof, immutable base or foundation layer which will provide us with cryptographic evidence of what is a Bitcoin.

&gt;Some individuals and groups within our communities and ranks spread fear and warn us of false narratives of “lightning hubs”, but fail to grasp that their scaling approach of on-chain transactions only pushes us in the direction of an actual (ethernet) hub design. If Bitcoin loses decentralization on its base layer, then we will lose Bitcoin. The past 9 years of work will have only resulted in a large, centralized broadcast hub with only a few remaining with the ability to operate such a monstrosity.

&gt;I wrote this article with hopes that it will help clear up the ongoing confusion about Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Lightning. It is designed to help better explain Blockchain and Lightning through analogies to concepts that we may be more familiar with. I also wrote this very quickly and it may contain typos.

"To avoid getting burnt, just hold.","About a year, or year-and-a-half ago, Bitcoin saw an influx of new investors. Did most of them understand what Bitcoin actually is, or the basics of how it works, or the problems it solves? Apparently not. Did most of the new investors have any kind of appreciation or understanding of the serious problems facing the existing ""global fiat money"" banking system? Apparently not. 

Most of them seemed to see Bitcoin as an easy ""shortcut"" by which to accumulate more fiat money: ""buy some BTC, wait a few days/weeks, sell, buy a sports car and have lots of fiat money."" Bitcoin, for them, became an epitome of the ""greater fool theory."" That is, ***for them, in their minds,*** Bitcoin was/is some kind of get-rich-quick scam. Most of them got burnt - and rightly so.

  
So, IS Bitcoin a scam? No. It's just that every so often we seem to get a new wave of people who treat it as such, and get burnt.

Waiting for the ETF?,"I understand perfectly why Nick Szabo isn't enthusiastic about attracting institutional assets to the crypto:

r/[https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1028752958266077185](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1028752958266077185)

Surprisingly (?), the market went down after the news about the Bakkt launch coming, and the same concerns the SEC decision everyone is expecting. While we waited for a positive decision, the market began to grow, now, when we know about its delay, it turns red. As if the cryptocurrency lost in value if it didn't make friends with Wall Street.  
Even decide SEC in BTC's favor, why is everyone so sure that it will have a good impact on the industry? Because everyone believes that last year's history with futures will repeat, but we should also take into account the fact that the market has changed in this year.

The inflow of institutional capital means increased control. The CEO of SEC says, for example, that BTC needs, quote: ""rules and trust"", end quote. And it is implied that SEC can offer it. Sounds ironic, if you recall Bitcoin was developed not least in response to the traditional financial institutions' loss of trust and in response to a violation of all conceivable rules. And the fact that they are now trying to control it, looks on the one hand, absolutely logical, and unpromising on the other.

Also, the level of enthusiasm in this regard indicates there are now too many people in the community who are interested in pure profit only, but not in the technical development of the industry.",1534267891,14/08/2018 17:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97actm/waiting_for_the_etf/,1

Are we still HODLing?,I have been watching the space and invested a bit since 2015 by continuing to buy dips and holding. Not the one to look up prices daily and speculate but the current trend has me worried a bit. What's the take on where the market is moving and what a 'casual enthusiast' like me can make of it.

Am i the only one getring annoyed by the FUD spreading by the 'hacked' unhackable wallet/McAffee story?,"Every 20 minutes there is a new article about how it got hacked, yet not in a way that compromises the private key.

His is FUD, plain and simple.  This is confusing the mainstream in the same way that the mainstream believes Bitcoin is insecure when an exchange gets hacked.

It honestly is driving me crazy how tarded everyone is being.  McAffee won't pay out because it has not been compromised.  The media won't let this go because they get clicks every time they generate 120 unique words of FUD.

CEX.io cost me $90 and I would like a response,"Hi all. I have had no problems actually using CEX so far but I have some initial funding issues which they have ignored, so I am coming to the community in hopes that CEX will finally care. 
 
I paid a $30 bank fee (can provide proof) to wire transfer $1200 USD to CEX, following the [instructions they provided](https://imgur.com/SeWIv71). A week later I was informed by my bank that the wire was rejected by CEX's bank, and their bank took a $50 fee (only $1150 came back, can provide proof), so at this point I've wasted $80.
 
I contacted CEX and found out that they had switched banks, with [no warning or update to users](https://i.imgur.com/ajWRRVS_d.jpg) and apparently they had ""no idea"" (which I don't believe, how can your company switch from Citi to DB without knowing? Someone had to sign up and fill out paperwork?), you can see this in [our email conversation](https://i.imgur.com/jNjMslz_d.jpg?). Regardless of if CEX knew or not, I think they are responsible to their users because they provide the instructions on their website, and this is a lapse in communication/business operations on their end with their partner. [They have ignored the case since] (https://i.imgur.com/vD9ItwE_d.jpg).
 
So I try again with their new instructions, and as you can see clearly specified, bank fees are [charged separately and not taken from the transfer amount](https://i.imgur.com/WmZcoGE_d.jpg). I sent another $1200 and paid another $30 fee. This time the wire was successful, but only $1190 was deposited. I emailed CEX and they tried to claim it was a bank fee at first, and after I pointed out that can't be, [they have ignored me] (https://i.imgur.com/PONdTwg_d.jpg).
 
So at this point I have lost $90 because of CEX through no fault of my own but lapses in execution on their end. This is not an insignificant amount of money especially when it is wasted on fees. I would just like someone at CEX to take responsibility for their business and actually respond to my case, if anyone can help me reach someone who won't just avoid and brush off my case, that would be much appreciated.
 
Thanks",1534279071,14/08/2018 20:37:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97by3h/cexio_cost_me_90_and_i_would_like_a_response/,1

Why Bitcoin is amazing,"I was supposed to receive some money through something called EasyPay. Maybe it's not available in all countries but it's like a physical PayPal. I show up, ask for my money, give them ID and they refused to give it to me because Im under 18. They basically stole money from me/from the sender. With Bitcoin it doesn't matter if you are 5, 18 or 120; you can still send and receive bitcoins and you need no permission from anyone. This is the first product that enables everyone to do that. This is why Bitcoin will succeed. Not because of the 10 mins confirmation time. People can wait a day or two. Not because of the 24/7/365 working hours. People are used to banks which are mon-fri 9-5. Those are great features but Bitcoin is special because it offers great censorship resistance and allows anyone to do as they wish with **their** own money. I hope I never have to open a bank account because Bitcoin is way way better.",1534292056,15/08/2018 00:14:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97dn3b/why_bitcoin_is_amazing/,1

What is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin? of gold?,"I'm having quite a debate on this issue so here's my opinion: Gold is money as it fulfills all three criteria: Store of value, unit of accounting and medium of exchange. Intrinsic value is solely due to its its practical applications in the real world (in electronics, aerospace etc...) Perceived value is due to our society's consensus that due to gold rarity, cost of mining and shiny look, it is valuable. Thus intrinsic value + perceived value= price of gold.

For Bitcoin, it has no intrinsic value. The ability to transact in a cheap, fast and immutable (ideal scenario) way is due to blockchain technology, not the coin itself. Similar to gold, perceived value lies in the consensus that the society has to this question 'how valuable should Bitcoin be?' This perceived value will be influenced by the fact that Bitcoin is cheap to use, fast to transact and is anonymous and secure.

PS: Is this correct-&gt; Currency is a representation of money that need not hold any intrinsic value.",1534292868,15/08/2018 00:27:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97dqpy/what_is_the_intrinsic_value_of_bitcoin_of_gold/,1

CEX.io cost my $90 and I would like a response,"Hi all. I have had no problems actually using CEX so far but I have some initial funding issues which they have ignored, so I am coming to the community in hopes that CEX will finally care. 


I paid a $30 bank fee (can provide proof) to wire transfer $1200 USD to CEX, following the [instructions they provided](https://i.imgur.com/M4WmW2F.png). A week later I was informed by my bank that the wire was rejected by CEX's bank, and their bank took a $50 fee (only $1150 came back, can provide proof), so at this point I've wasted $80. I contacted CEX and found out that they had switched banks, with [no warning or update to users](https://i.imgur.com/uPzWBRH.png) and apparently they had ""no idea"" (which I don't believe, how can your company switch from Citi to DB without knowing? Someone had to sign up and fill out paperwork?), you can see this in [our email conversation](https://i.imgur.com/BTn1iBZ.png). Regardless of if CEX knew or not, I think they are responsible to their users because they provide the instructions on their website, and this is a lapse in communication/business operations on their end with their partner. [They have ignored the case since] (https://i.imgur.com/f44VKQO.png). 


So I try again with their new instructions, and as you can see clearly specified, bank fees are [charged separately and not taken from the transfer amount](https://i.imgur.com/YjfM0tO.png). I sent another $1200 and paid another $30 fee. This time the wire was successful, but only $1190 was deposited. I emailed CEX and they tried to claim it was a bank fee at first, and after I pointed out that can't be, [they have ignored me] (https://i.imgur.com/PONdTwg_d.jpg). 


So at this point I have lost $90 because of CEX through no fault of my own but lapses in execution on their end. This is not an insignificant amount of money especially when it is wasted on fees. I would just like someone at CEX to take responsibility for their business and actually respond to my case, if anyone can help me reach someone who won't just avoid and brush off my case, that would be much appreciated. 


Thanks",1534302648,15/08/2018 03:10:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97ew6i/cexio_cost_my_90_and_i_would_like_a_response/,1

Goldman Sachs &amp; Wall Street Banks - A Word of Warning,"Let this be [a word of warning](https://www.ccn.com/goldman-sachs-wall-street-banks-sink-32-million-into-enterprise-blockchain-startup/) to anyone &amp; everyone who thinks these major financial institutions who currently control the majority of the worlds economies would simply 'adopt a crypto' and roll-over; giving up there massive amount of control of the worlds economy just because they realized fiat was inferior to (insert shitcoin here). Make no mistake we are essentially giving them the technology we are working so hard on for free and with a quick copy and paste they can just as easily create their own versions of currency as seen by CMC. These institutions are simply biding there time and picking up cheap new blockchains like these for what is equivalent to there pocket change; and when these major players are ready *will* make these the world dominant blockchains overnight. 	

These Institutions will not relinquish there control so easily, they will adapt and overcome as they have always done, manipulate with fear and rumor, create laws with the stroke of a pen on a check to any willing politician, destroy anything/anyone with the wave of a hand, then take everything with the other. This is what they do, their primary motivation is greed, profit above all else by any means necessary. Crypto was intended to free itself from these very financial institutions, to give EVERYONE a source of wealth that isn't controlled by one single entity that can simply print more or type a few numbers into a bank account. However crypto' has since been diluted by the same thing which brought us to the current state of affairs our world &amp; economies are currently crippled by, greed. 	

We are so blinded by profit we can't see these obvious steps of control being made right in front of us or the even the war we didn't realize we started. So what's the good news? We are winning. You individuals who have been apart of this construct of cryptocurrency have contributed so much of your time, money and willpower that it is now deemed a threat. This could be seen when the media and large banking institutions started changing there tune about crypto', like [JPMorgan](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/jpmorgan-crypto-strategy-20180517) for example. They now realize blockchain technology while scattered is useful, while also useful it could be dangerous as their form of fiat wealth is transferred more and more into a form they are yet to have control over. 	

Take your financial freedom back, use something/s that has already proven itself time and time again for the past 8 years without fail. Do whatever you can unite with other crypto enthusiast, to encourage and discuss with those who have not yet understood its premise for existence to see their wealth for what it is, personal security for the future generations whose lives without which would be controlled by whomever controls the supply of money. Let the public control their own currency and aim for decentralized blockchains as currency standards, because if we don't take control, then greed most certainly will.",1534319259,15/08/2018 07:47:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97gf7i/goldman_sachs_wall_street_banks_a_word_of_warning/,1

Bitcoin as gold standard replacement,"We all know it. Fiat at one point was backed by gold and the paper money we got was in a way a placeholder for that gold. Nations got rid of the gold standard and nowadays there is nothing behind our paper money aside of a promise.  


We know that this promise does only work when things go smooth. As soon as a country gets into rough water a multitude of problems arise. ATM's stop giving YOUR money out like in Greece, inflation reaches thousands of percents and makes your money worthless like in Zimbabwe, shelf's of supermarkets become empty like in Venezuela.  


Bitcoin was created in a part as a solution to those problems and as an answer to the problems countries - and thus their citizen - face if their leaders act against logic and moralistic principles and lead with their ego and narcissism instead. And while more scientists in governments would be a solution to that problem, we might never see that materialize. After all we like to follow those who shout loudest and that might not change for a while.  


So we're stuck with Bitcoin.   
But nations don't want to adopt Bitcoin and give away control over their money and we might not see that change either.  
And yet I do think they will not have a choice at one point.   


We see it in all those failed states and those on the way, like Turkey. People bring their money into safety and choose more and more Cryptocurrencies for this. What will happen if in one of those states a critical mass is reached and so many citizen possess Bitcoin - hopefully - or another Cryptocurrency, that the black market will start to thrive by using them as primary payment method. It will create an avalanche that might very well engulf more than half of the population of such a country.   


Now leaders might crack down and forbid shops to sell goods, except with the national currency, but we know how this goes. You can't stop a black market like this. And what choice do those countries have to get out of the misery?  


They will try to print more money - which of course never works, then they start to create alternative money like bond notes - which also will not work. They name outside forces and clamp down on any trade that still goes over the border to prevent subsidized items like food or fuel to be traded for money, and just make a bad situation worse.   


Finally they either are in such a horrible spot that they declare bankruptcy and their citizen loose everything or try desperate measure like binding the course of their currency to the USD. Or the army - now also without payment - finally takes over the country. Or hey, they create their own crypto - which is just equivalent to printing more worthless paper money. Ha!  


With Bitcoin there is another alternative. If anyways a lot of the citizen already possess and trade with Bitcoin, a failed state could just declare Bitcoin as the new gold standard for the nation. Backing the national currency with Bitcoin.  


This would immediately restore some trust in the government, would allow the government to make quite some good money by buying Bitcoin reserves before any announcement and even up the wealth of their citizen at the same time, restoring a lot of buying power in one smooth move. After all, any country that announces such a step, and especially the first one doing so, will lead to quite a higher price in Bitcoin. It would most likely even make a national crypto possible and allow a country to retain some sort of control.   


No, I don't think that this is the first or plausible choice in the minds of such governments. But I do think that at one point in the future they might not have a better way out of their self-inflicted misery. I'm certain this will happen, just a matter of time.",1534324671,15/08/2018 09:17:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97gtmq/bitcoin_as_gold_standard_replacement/,1

"Technology determines innovation, can blockchain tourism relay the blockchain technology torch?","Every technological change will produce new things. The Internet has witnessed a great revolution many years ago. Recently, the hot blockchain technology has been given the ""protagonist"" aura. With the gradual improvement of living standards, more and more Young people like to use tourism as one of the ways to relax and adjust their lives. Therefore, blockchain tourism has begun to penetrate into the traditional tourism industry.

https://i.redd.it/w0vbyvaan8g11.png

This shows that the long-term compulsory shopping, high-priced consumption, and asymmetric tourism information are finally expected to be resolved. So, what role does blockchain tourism play in consumers, platforms, and businesses?

**consumer**

The blockchain tourism platform is a “savior” for consumers, which reverses the passive position of consumers in traditional OTA. After the blockchain technology is financially effective, the domestic blockchain tourism The platform has also sprung up, the most worthy of the domestic online travel platform - LEOOY, based on the blockchain decentralization technology, the consumer's privacy information is guaranteed, the implementation of peer-to-peer transactions, direct links Merchants and consumers save consumers the money they should not spend, greatly improving the user experience.

https://i.redd.it/c6ivsj0cn8g11.png

**platform**

For the platform, the decentralization technology really reduces the workload of the platform. Take LEOOY as an example,the platform is responsible for maintaining the normal operation of the platform. All participants participate in community building, blockchain smart contract rules and incentives. The mechanism automatically rewards and rewards the participants who contribute to the community. On the blockchain tourism platform, the platform is not a referee, nor is it a arbitrator. Every user who participates in the competition is the real arbiter.

https://i.redd.it/qeobia0dn8g11.png

**Merchant**

The traditional OTA third party viciously collects the commission, so that the merchant has to raise the price to obtain the original benefits. On the blockchain travel platform, the merchants do not have to fight with the platform, and the blockchain technology is applied in the tourism industry. To a certain extent, the existence of “third parties” has been eliminated. LEOOY has paid special attention to this point. When faced with the untrue evaluation of consumers, the platform will confirm the true and false through strict information review. If it is not, the information platform will be reduced. Consumer credit scores, service providers can even refuse to provide services to participants with very low customer ratings. Correspondingly, if the consumer score is higher, you can pay less for the shared service, or you can enjoy the preferential price of the service provider.

https://i.redd.it/phg88fydn8g11.png

Blockchain tourism is generally relatively fair to all three parties. Decentralized technology, fair and transparent mechanism, and big data processing have made the traditional OTA unresolved problems get a new unlocking posture, technical decision The revolutionary, disruptive Internet revolution may not be the second time, but it is undeniable that the blockchain technology will bring us changes in life in the future, which is immeasurable. And LEOOY, is working hard to do this.

Bitcoin is better because...,"It's that immutable ledger built through proof of work that will always make Bitcoin that bit more plausible than any alt coin, shit coin or even ""willed into existence"" fiat. And when all other things are seemingly equal, it is this fact, that will in time make the masses gravitate towards Bitcoin.  

It doesn't even matter that the proof of work is a complete waste of energy, it's the fact that it does take SOME energy that makes the difference.

And this energy has been used to build what is surely the most perfect immutable ledger that mankind has ever created. Forget banks ledgers they will contain mistakes and will always be imperfect.

And this ledger stands like a shining monument to proof of work and immutability, even more awe inspiring than the great pyramids in my opinion.

So I declare that it is these facts that set Bitcoin apart and all of Bitcoins reported troubles are due to mankind's inability to see this, at this present moment.

Bitcoin mining on a laptop - how much can I make?,"So I want to get into Bitcoin and mining, and I've got a spare laptop around that I leave on 24/7 anyways. How much money do you think I can make (USD) per day? It's a Lenovo Miix (700 series, I think) with a CPU similar to one of these:

    Intel® Core™ m3-6Y30 Processor (4M Cache, 900 MHz), Turbo Boost 2.0 (2.2 GHz)
    Intel Core m5-6Y54 Processor (4M Cache, 1.1 GHz), Turbo Boost 2.0 (2.7 GHz)
    Intel Core m7-6Y75 Processor (4M Cache, 1.2 GHz), Turbo Boost 2.0 (3.1 GHz)

Power bills aren't an issue and I would rather not make the laptop overheat and use 100% CPU all the time which may kill it overtime.

My theory on what is happening with BTC,"=======================

I think the BTC futures contract is behind a lot of the decline.

There are three markets for BTC

\- OTC markets: super deep

\- Exchange: much less deep

\- Futures: the least deep

Wall Street Arbs are doing the following

1. buying BTC OTC 

2. and selling futures against them.

They do this at ""flat"" -- not trying to make a bet or make money.

Then, as we approach expiration, they suddenly dump all their BTC on the exchanges forcing down the price.

They cash close the futures for a nice gain.

I used to do this kind of thing professionally for 6 years. It works.

We’ve built a proper cryptocurrency exchange comparator – looking for feedback!,"So pretty much every day someone asks one of the following questions on a bitcoin or cryptocurrency related subreddit:

* Where can I margin trade as a United States citizen?
* Where can I buy BTC with PayPal?
* Where can I buy coin X with BTC?
* …

So as a response to this, a mate and I built [https://exchangify.io](https://exchangify.io/). It’s an exchange comparator that allows people to easily filter on certain aspects of an exchange, while also providing near-real time cryptocurrencies rates (think less than a minute for 95% of all exchanges).

We know there’s already a bunch of sites comparing cryptocurrency exchanges (CryptoCompare, Coingecko etc.) but neither of them really allows people to easily filter on a certain aspect, say for example “Margin Trading”. Or “Exchanges that support VISA as a United States Citizen.” We built Exchangify with the intent of allowing people to do just that.

We’ve collected some feedback on BitcoinMarkets already, where one of the main issues was the mobile performance. We believe we fixed this now, but please let us know if you still have issues with the mobile version. Please be aware that this isn’t a professional project, so expect bugs or inconsistencies. It’d be amazing if you could point them out though.

Here are some of the updates we’re planning to do in the foreseeable future:

* Add minimum fiat deposit filter
* Add withdrawal payment methods
* Support for derivatives exchanges

BITCOIN ETF's,"I wasn't sure I would go forward with this, but I feel a moral and ethical obligation to. And while this is really going to upset and possibly enrage the close friends I have who work in some of the larger named Investment Banks on Wall Street, I want to share this with everyone I can reach in the crypto space and let the chips fall where they may.  Here's the deal: 

The market has done a great job of convincing everyone the Bitcoin ETFs are the end-all be-all for crypto growth.  (They're not. At all.) 

But they want you to believe this to get the prices down really really low for Wall Street. And everyone seems to be playing right into their propaganda. Realize that Bitcoin ETF's have been applied for and denied going back the last 5 years.

With our recent run testing a $1 Trillion crypto market cap, Wall Street woke up and realized holy hell there is actually a ton of money to be made in this space and it has barely begun. But they missed the boat! So they want in, cheap; Convince everyone these ETF proposals are paramount for the market to ever go up again. (What a joke!). Realize the most likely scenario is these Bitcoin ETFs will not be approved at all this year until early or late next year; all the while using each delay and denial to further drive down the price of BTC. We can stop this if we stop giving credence to their propaganda that is the importance of the ETFs.

Clearly the ETF Proposals are clouding the crypto space to the point it is absurd and ridiculous -- you see it, I see it, and yet we are all playing into it and spreading their manipulative message. Entirely too much focus is being placed on the ETFs.

What everyone needs to be focused on is the technology and adoption. Stay focused on the technology and adoption of crypto, it's what got the market to nearly $1 Trillion already, and let's all let the ETFs do whatever they're going to do. 

If we can get everyone on the same page here (and if we work together we can) Bitcoin will brush off the ETF bull shiitake and the crypto market will continue to grow massively with the awesome developments in the crypto space.  Do not give Wall Street the pleasure of seeing you Tweet, Post, YouTube, etc anything having to do with the ETFs. Just stop. Let's bring it to a full stop my crypto friends. 

Will you do your part to help the crypto community get back on track with focusing on what really matters -- the technology and adoption.  Shine the light on this important message and share it with all. Thanks in advance.

The TPS Myth,"I have seen a lot of debate over TPS (Transactions Per Second) and there is something that continually bothers me.

Statistically speaking, its possible to calculate the *effective* TPS for an on-chain tx, but the reality is that with 10 minute blocks, the TPS is actually 0 for on-chain tx's.  Which makes the whole argument of one 10min/block chain being *faster* than another 10min/block chain completely ludicrous.

If the best practice is to never accept an unconfirmed tx, then neither chain will ever be sufficient for a POS (Point of Sale) transaction when the potential max time to confirmation is 10 minutes.  A bit of a strawman, but the reality is the low end of statistically significant transactions is going to be somewhere north of a minute to confirm which is *still* too slow for POS.  POS needs conf times under 30 seconds to be competitive, and I am being REALLY generous.  30 seconds is a LONG time to stand in-front of a cashier waiting for the payment to process.

So given that very few of the blockchains operate at the necessary speed to handle an onchain tx on a timescale compatible with POS, why is there so much vitriol and gnashing of teeth over off chain txs?  Bigger blocks aren't going to materially speed things up, it just increases potential capacity.

Is it really just the miners or is this a case of people (maybe even me) just don't get it?

BTC scammer on Telegram,"# TLDR;

So I was minding my self on telegram when I've received a message from an ""Alex Moneymaker"" pretending that he was banned from a gambling website and that he's got 1.4btc there. He wants that I create an account, get the money and transfer it. However, the website needs an amount to activate the account, 0.01BTC.

Here are some interesting bits of the discussion with comments:

&gt;Alex Moneymaker, \[15 Aug 2018 at 22:37:35\]:

When I've seen his message, I knew what's happening and wanted to see how the scheme works.

"Machine Learning, AI Chess Supercomputers, and The Future of The Retail Investor","## 

r/[https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2017/12/deep-mind-alpha-zeros-immortal-zugzwang-game-stockfish/](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2017/12/deep-mind-alpha-zeros-immortal-zugzwang-game-stockfish/)

Even if you don't play chess, you can still appreciate the significance of this chess game between Googles new machine learning AI program, known as ""AlphaZero"", and Stockfish, which up until this point, was the strongest chess computer in the world. Stockfish is a classical computer, where millions of games are programmed into the software. It weights certain positions by a point system, and calculates via a brute force method, going through 100's of millions of positions, then picking the right one. As a chess player myself, playing Stockfish is futile, as even the most minute positional mistake will lead to an outright frontal assault on your king, or a loss of a piece 10 moves later. You'd think Stockfish would at least put up a fight, but what resulted shocked the chess and computer world. Not only did AlphaZero win decisively, but out of 100 games, Stockfish couldn't even win once. It was like watching a novice chess player playing a grandmaster, with AlphaZero making ridiculous sacrifices for seemingly dubious positional advantages, where 20 moves down the road, AlphaZero would end up with the better position. It was like Skynet on a chessboard. To make a sacrifice against a chess computer, even one, is a feat in it's own right, but it seemed like every other move was a ridiculously long line of 100's of different lines branching into 100's more. Almost every move included some kind of sacrifice.

You can almost feel like there is a human like intuitive discernment happening, like there is a person, and not just some robot, moving the pieces. It doesn't need to calculate as many positions like Stockfish because it sees a bigger picture that Stockfish is incapable of understanding. AlphaZero has a cohesion of thought that results in original insight, which you see in this game. It's like AlphaZero has a spacial understanding of the game that seems almost human. At times, it even seemed like AlphaZero was toying with Stockfish.

I believe this spacial understanding, and intuitive calculation, rather than brute force tallying, is the future of stock algorithms. Before these games, Google's AlphaGo beat the strongest Go player in the world, shocking the Go community. At the time, many professional Go players thought it was impossible to create a program that could beat a human due to Go's intuitive requirements, something up until then at least, was believed to be unique to humans. A few years ago, facebook had to shutdown it's AI algo because it created it's own language and was communicating with itself. Machine learning is already inventing new ways of doing things, without needing any human guidance. Is this really surprising though? Remember the movie Demolition Man with Wesley Snipes and Sylvester Stallone. The story was set in 2032, which back then was 40 years in the future, where people had flying cars and used seashell to wipe their ass. Well, it's 2018 now, almost 2019. Will this technology make the retail trader obsolete? Hopefully not, but as a long time chess player, who has watched hundreds of engines play, something inside me fears this may be the case",1534382165,16/08/2018 01:16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97nxob/machine_learning_ai_chess_supercomputers_and_the/,1

Day 24 of Dispute at Localbitcoins - Nightmare,"While I am not offended for a dispute entering 24th day which is exceptionally long but what I am truly disappointed for is:

1. The other party has no evidence to their claims in last 24 days. Nothing but stories with no evidence in backing.
2. Dispute process is exceptionally slow. Admin asks one questions and looks at it 24 hours later and asks another question.
3. No communication on weekend.
4. When both parties say we have provided all evidences you need, what is point of asking same questions again? Why not just decide when both parties want a decision? 

In case you would like to see dispute details, you may refer to another thread of mine

What is Bitcoin? how Bitcoin Works?,"Bitcoin is one of the most important inventions in all of human history. For the first time ever, anyone can send or receive any amount of money with anyone else, anywhere on the planet, conveniently and without restriction.

Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.

Mining — a process of record-keeping, done through the use of computer processing power.

Blockchain — a public distributed ledger where records of every Bitcoin transaction are held.

Specifications:

SHA-256d

Algoritham: Proof of Work

Block Time, sec: 600

Reward, coins per block: 50

Halfing reward cycle, blocks: 210240

If there is one revolution that is slowly paving the path.

Market capitalization is used to work out the total value of an asset or business. It is calculated by multiplying the current market price against the total amount of coins or shares in circulation.

Coinbase to Pursue Decentralized Form of Identification Following Acquisition,"Cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase has acquired San Francisco-based startup Distributed Systems Inc., which works on decentralized identity solutions, according to an August 15 announcement.

In the blog post, B Byrne, project manager for Identity at Coinbase, said Distributed Systems will help the exchange work on new ways to validate and verify identity within its plans to develop an open financial system. The blog post says:

&gt;“Blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies offers a new way to let us all be “verified” everywhere we go on the internet, feeling safer about our interactions with others and opening the door to the experiences that require trust.”

In the blog post, Byrne describes a type of identity wherein users retain control over their private information, without having to give a copy away. Citing the example of a Social Security Number, Byrne says that every time one is asked to provide it, the recipient now has a version of that information, which “has exactly the same power as the original.”

With the new acquisition, Byrne says Coinbase will work toward a decentralized identity that will “let you prove that you own an identity, or that you have a relationship with the Social Security Administration, without making a copy of that identity.”

Byrne further stated that Coinbase needs to be “deliberate about how and where we apply this technology,” considering anonymity, privacy, and other sensitive data issues.

According to TechCrunch, Distributed Systems was incorporated in 2015 with a focus on developing an identity standard for dApps called the Clear Protocol. Last year, the startup reportedly raised a $1.7 million seed round led by venture capital fund Floodgate.

The company was considering raising a $4 million to $8 million round this summer, but the team began negotiations about investment with Coinbase, which resulted in the acquisition.

Coinbase has previously acquired companies in order to expand its services. In June, the exchange acquired securities dealer Keystone Capital Corp. in addition to Venovate Marketplace, Inc., and Digital Wealth LLC in order to become a fully regulated broker dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision. The acquisition could help Coinbase extend its offerings and subsequently expand into non-crypto financial products.

""In order to demonstrate its commitment to rewarding responsible bug disclosures, the Bitcoin SV team will begin by offering the highest tier reward of USD $100,000 (sponsored by CoinGeek and of course, payable in BCH) to Cory Fields, a security researcher who found and responsibly disclosed a potential BCH chain-splitting bug in May of this year.  The result of this anonymous disclosure was a rapid and professional response that ensured the vulnerability was patched quickly and the network secured.   Through its bug bounty program, the Bitcoin SV project wants to encourage more professional disclosures like that to help strengthen BCH.""

LEOOY: Accelerating the development of the tourism industry with blockchain as the medium,"With the enthusiasm of “Technology Era + Tourism Era”, LEOOY is the first to introduce blockchain technology into the tourism industry and develop blockchain tourism.

https://i.redd.it/s53s4llo4fg11.jpg

In the new information technology era, the tourism industry has already stood at the fork of humanities and technology. Artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing have all entered the tourism industry. The blockchain tourism platform headed by LEOOY has begun to block. Chain technology is used in tourism. The development of the tourism industry and the development of scientific and technological forces must complement each other. How can the tourism industry break through the boundaries of form and industry and usher in a new climax?

The bottleneck of technology companies is low conversion rate, and the bottleneck of the tourism industry is low industrial efficiency. Technology brings time to the imagination of tourism, and tourism brings space to imagination. The OTA platform is the most widely used in the tourism industry, and can even be said to be a monopoly. Tourism is ultimately an industry, not a sentimental thing. How to industrialize and standardize it into a commercial body with the ability to realize liquidity and replicate on a large scale. The power of new technology is still very important.

*Processing img fbktnaep4fg11...*

A typical problem encountered by the tourism industry is that consumers and markets rely on traditional OTA platforms for transportation and hotel bookings and transactions. But with the increase in usage, the drawbacks have made many consumers miserable.

Consumer price issues, market service providers' cost issues, and various reports of deceiving consumers for marketing purposes are also emerging. The problem for consumers is that the quality of service providers is not in place, the prices of scenic spots and transportation are too expensive, and the implicit terms of the platform are too ""pit people."" The problem with enterprise service providers is that the platform is too expensive, resulting in large cost and inability to match the consumer quality at the same price, resulting in low corporate reputation.

*Processing img hls78ycq4fg11...*

The development of a service-oriented industry, consumers and enterprises are the mainstays, the new blockchain technology has the characteristics of “decentralization”, and the third-party intermediary platform is removed. Tourist service providers can directly connect with tourists, and visitors can pass the blockchain. The technology-based blockchain travel platform can query the scenic spot online, book hotels, etc. The information in all blocks can not be falsified, open and transparent to ensure the authenticity of the information. Real-time settlement through point-to-point smart contract, saving the cost of service providers, reducing consumer prices and ensuring the interests of consumers.

*Processing img wlu6d26r4fg11...*

The tourism industry is a service-oriented industry. Enterprise service providers and consumers are the two main players. The occurrence of each bottleneck is caused by the contradiction between these two main bodies, which leads to the development of smoothness. Therefore, in order to accelerate the development of the tourism industry, It is to develop new information technology forces to balance and resolve the contradiction between the two.

*Processing img goneymtr4fg11...*

When tourism service providers pay more attention to the quality of service provided, and tourism consumers are not entangled in some problems of cost and experience, tourism consumers will pay attention to the meaning of culture and tourism, and will be more willing to participate, and blockchain tourism. The technical characteristics can be said to be a timely rain. Its emergence must be strong and powerful for accelerating the development of the tourism industry.

I'm just wondering what is the reason behind that the difficulty is adjusted only after 2016 blocks.

To me it seems to be quite a big number and as there are more coins sharing SHA256 PoW it might cause troubles in the future.

Is there any reason why it's not adjusted sooner? Or is it just simply coming from history and noone cares?",1534409652,16/08/2018 08:54:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97qn33/why_the_difficulty_is_adjusted_after_2016_blocks/,1

I want to mine on the PC only when I'm using it and not when I'm sleeping as the fans will generate far too much noise and heat.

2) What programs/services do you recommend me to download to mine Bitcoins (or some other type of crypto that I can transfer to Bitcoin easily as I've heard mining Bitcoin is maybe not profitable now?)

3) Will doing this kill my GPU/CPU? I only want to mine when I'm using the computer for 8-12 hours per day.

Daile Market Recap - 08/16 - Bitcoin Struggling To Maintain Momentum,"Where is the market heading? It’s still a bears court and the market is still nervous of any sudden movement. As we are nearing the weekends again, it is important that Bitcoin lead the recovery in a decisive price movement soon. As it is, the trend is still downwards and the recovery is very weak.

Bitcoin dominance continues to fly although, lower today at 53.4%. The representative coin managed to reach $6600 this morning in the Asian Markets but was not able to maintain this level and it made a correction back to $6400. It has made a marginal growth at 0.29% with $4.5 Billion trade volume. Currently, it is trading at $6425.

As mentioned yesterday, the bulls need to conquer and maintain $6800 in order to see a real and substantial recovery. The bulls should be able to make a higher low and a higher high in order to consolidate its gains and momentum.

"Bitcoin going up, then down, then up... Wish it would make up it's mine!","Went to bed last night and my toy miner was making about $1.50 a day.  Woke up this morning and it's making $5.00 a day.  Figured it was a dream so rolled over and fell out of my chair!  I got up and figured I need to sip a bit more of my hot coffee and try harder to wake up.  Since I am brand new to this mining thing, I have to either guess what is going on or ask.  My guess is, since I am mining using NiceHash, I hit onto a job someone was paying a lot to mine.  I noticed about a $300 spike up in Bitcoin price on CoinDesk BPI, so I am thinking someone with bucks to spend either bought alot of Bitcoin to excite miners, or something more involved is going on.  What is going on?

I have noticed my USD is fluctuating pretty drastically up and down, but more down then up.  At $3.83 right now.  I think I liked it at $5.00 better.

Paper wallets won't work for obvious reasons. Hardware wallets still have a screen. I thought perhaps the Ledger Nano S might work since it also has an app to manage it, but I just talked to their support and they said the screen is essential to be able to see.

Currently I'm using Electrum on an offline computer, and then using an Electrum watch-only wallet on my main computer. Is this the most secure I can hope to be?

My offline computer is just offline most of the time, sometimes I have to use it online but it's very rare. But that's the best I have right now.

Fiat Money Panic vs Bitcoin Panic sell,"I would understand fiat money panic sell.

It's hard to live on with people who's completly lost their ability to think by themselves. Look around the world currency market what's happening now. There's a quite serious problem of inflation and a currency crisis is emerging every hour. But the people still want fiat money instead of bitcoin? 

I think bitcoin panic sell is a joke though I will definitly understand paper money panic sell..

Remember there's no fundermental change at all of bitcoin rather spreading deep roots everyday and  it's bringing more and more people and even world famous loan sharks. HODL your BTC.

A parable.,"Long ago, in a land far away, a famine was coming.  Some people could see it coming, others either failed to notice or had decided in their minds that there would be no famine.  Still, the famine was coming.

The wise people began to buy and store grain for themselves.  The price of grain went up.  Speculators took note and began to buy grain as well.  This caused a massive FOMO spike in the price of grain, until it peaked and began to fall, but not without volatility.  Traders tried to guess which way the price of grain would go next.  Most of them ended up broke.

Wise people continued to hold their grain; those who were able, continued to accumulate it.

The unwise saw grain as merely a way to accumulate piles of local fiat currency.  They sold their grain and stashed the money.

Then the famine arrived.

What good is a pile of local fiat currency when there is no food in the market and your stomach has been empty for days?",1534440021,16/08/2018 17:20:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97u8h3/a_parable/,1

"Letter to the crypto community: you won't change anything with greed, spite, and hatred","I've been around the community for several months, but I learned more about it this summer. I write news articles for a crypto website. And I've been watching the community more than actually contributing to it with comments. I just wanted to say that guys, you look like a herd of hungry wolves from the outside, and it's not a nice look. I'll be as objective and factual as I can, because that's what I do - I don't get paid for shilling, I get paid for finding out the *facts.* ASAP. Besides, I get more money from writing about crypto than actually trading (I'm on about -80%, wtf), so I don't have a financial interest at all.

* Each community is united until it's not. You're a community till you fork, and you fight each other on Twitter to death after that. Like someone stole your money or something.
* Almost everyone tries to outsmart everyone. I mean, what's the point? Some online trophy? Getting someone make a meme or quote you on Instagram? Honestly, set some values, people. 
* Being funny almost always means mocking someone. You're forgetting Reddit's no. 1 rule - Remember the human. There's a human on the other side. I'm seeing your comments calling me an idiot over nothing. I can see your biased criticism. And I do get over it quickly, but that makes *you* a more ugly person.
* You're missing the common goal. Some of you are here for money alone. Some of you are here for the philosophy behind crypto and blockchain. Both sides are fair, but don't forget - you only make money *if others make money* along with you and AT THE SAME TIME *if the rest of them lose loads of money*. A market is made of *people*. And if you earn $100k and buy a lambo, maybe someone on the other side of the world is selling their kidney to support their family after losing that money. The current financial system sucks because we have to kill each other to win. But at the same time we have to work together. This brings me to...
* You're missing the point. Abolishing the current financial system. Improving the world. Minimising inequality. You know, meaningful shit!

Instead, what if you

* Thought about actually changing this shitty world, because you're enough people, with enough money altogether, and with the technology at hand.
* Thought less about winning the game, as long as you still have a roof above your head? 
* Learned how to lose as well? (and this bearish market is a good opportunity...)
* instead of ""being funny"" or ""smart"", would actually try to be wise?
* would remember that blockchain is about change and about the community. It removes trust from the equation so the world becomes more secure. Do you think greed is really what we should replace it with? Because honestly, I've seen more greed than security in the crypto world.

"Bitcoin derivatives, ETFs, and custodial fund regulation","So I'm not sure how the BTC derivatives market is managed and regulated, but I'm sort of conflicted with whether users want Bitcoin to be regulated or not in the future in terms of ETFs and custodial funds. On the one hand, the whole point of Bitcoin is to be self-regulated by consensus and eventually govern itself without the help of governments and institutions (after all, that was the whole point of this cryptocurrency revolution). 

Now that the big institutions are trying to set up ETF funds, custodial funds, and the currently existing futures and derivatives market, it seems like it's inevitable that government will try to intervene with respect to regulation. That said, I am of opine that there should be clear cut rules and regulations that will help users track their Bitcoin to ensure that it is kept in a safe place. With the derivatives and futures market, I've never seen how the contracts look like, but I think that there should be a wallet address in the contract that shows the specific amount purchased so that user may be able to track it without fraud. The same can be applied for ETFs and custodial funds; when a user purchases a certain amount of BTC through their brokerage account in the future, there should be an address so that they can keep track of their Bitcoin to ensure it hasn't been tampered with. I understand that the ultimate goal is to be able to control your funding, but if the institutions wants to ""facilitate"" these transactions, the least they could do is be as transparent about it as possible.

Before anybody jumps in to say that the institutions and governments are always crooked and will defraud their users, take a step back and see how truly revolutionary Bitcoin is. Back then, when you bought futures, ETFs, or had custodial funding for gold, all you got was a certificate saying you have X amount of gold. It was a mere certificate backed by nothing. For all you know, the gold they were holding for you could have been diluted pyrite or just a figment of your imagination. However, if the governments and institutions are able to allow users to track their BTC funds through the blockchain explorer and see that it hasn't been touched or tampered with, this will allow them to see any type of wrongdoing or fraud. THIS IS what separates Bitcoin from any other type of commodity or asset ever.

To those wondering about the future of Bitcoin.. I just want to share something.,"Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons..

I just want to share that since January, I have been watching big institutions, investors, parties buy and sell bitcoin to each other to the tune of BILLIONS.. I can't talk about my role, or how I got into this world.. But every morning my messages read something like:

""They wants 30k coins per day for the next week or until supply runs out""

""They are willing to pay market +2 for 200k coins as long as escrow of their choice is used""

These guys are paying ABOVE market in some cases, and happily doing so. That 15% drop followed by that 30% increase? It's not random. Not all of them at least. The market is volatile, but not all of it.

These buyers are all over the world, some even created banks to help move the money around.. I'm not saying this to show off because, well I'm not the one making billions of dollars, (I'm just the person watching paperwork get pushed around), but to share that bitcoin is NOT going anywhere. times are tough right now, but please take this (if you even believe me) as a sign that bitcoin is being hoarded up by the big guys and it's going to keep going for years.

Keep the faith, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere..",1534449204,16/08/2018 19:53:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97vkia/to_those_wondering_about_the_future_of_bitcoin_i/,1

Bitcoin mining difficulty up another 24% in just the last 30 days!,"A year ago the hashpower needed to mine Bitcoin was insane, the network was considered unbreakable.

But its continued to double every few months.

This is an indicator that the $ cost for many miners has continued to increase, yet investment into mining continues to thrive. Mining is basically an entire sub economy of the tech sector creating  massive amounts of wealth and jobs.

Here's a link showing charts for the increase in hash power...it shocked me in January and I didnt think it would just keep going up so much during this bear market.

https://www.coinwarz.com/difficulty-charts/bitcoin-difficulty-chart

With so many questions about miner cost influencing supply and thus price, I'd like to hear your thoughts.

If hashpower doubles again, the price support will likely gone up? Seeing as the 2014 crash had essentially no miner investment on this scale, its logical to assume that this is a game changer that continues to evolve.

Even the people getting free hydro will start to be squeezed out with these difficulty levels. It reminds me of the way the diamond miners can control supply to influence price. 

Thoughts?

Do you guys day trade or hold bitcoin?,"Hello,

I've wanted to get into cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin, for awhile now. I'm pretty young(Junior @ HS), so I think that puts me in a pretty good position to start delving into this. Supposedly, Day Trading cryptocurrency can make you an insane amount of money, but I'm kind of put off by the fact that most day traders lose money and if professionals are failing at making money then someone with no experience like me will likely struggle. I'm still going to probably try it with a small amount of money the sake of it, but I wanted to know what you guys do with your bitcoin. 

Thanks!

Question on Exchange Cash in/ Cash out limits,"Question on Exchange limits

My Cash In is limited.

My Cash Out is unlimited.

I recently had an issue where my exchange would not allow for my unlimited cash out because they counted the BTC to Fiat as again a cash in.

[https://support.coins.ph/hc/en-us/articles/360000014522-What-counts-towards-my-daily-monthly-transaction-limits-](https://support.coins.ph/hc/en-us/articles/360000014522-What-counts-towards-my-daily-monthly-transaction-limits-)

I feel like I went through the verification process, got unlimited cash out, then they disallowed it.

Do any other exchanges have this obscure interpretation of cash out (and limit cash out based on cash in limit?)

Am I wrong to feel like their unlimited cash out is disingenuous?",1534484014,17/08/2018 05:33:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/97zogr/question_on_exchange_cash_in_cash_out_limits/,1

"The Bitcoin Price Is Up 10% In 24 Hours To Over $7,000 -- What's Pushing It Up?",,1534500823,17/08/2018 10:13:43,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/07/17/the-bitcoin-price-is-up-10-in-24-hours-to-over-7000-whats-pushing-it-up/,1
$114 Million USD worth of Bitcoin moved to BitMex,"On August 14th, 2018 when all in crypto seemed down and quite, a significant movement of bitcoin caused a conversation among the community. A large sum of Bitcoin began surfacing in an account registered as 3BMEXqGpG4FxBA1KWhRFufXfSTRgzfDBhj. The money deposited into this account came from multiple other accounts; was it payments made or a person wanting to shift all his savings into one account? Seventeen different accounts were responsible for this more substantial sum of money being moved. 10 BTC was transferred to the associated BitMex wallet, the transaction was processed at 4:50 AM New York time. The remaining 17 990 BTC amount was transacted less than half an hour after the first. Since the last transaction, the account has been static.

**Why?**

Since notice of this massive amount of Bitcoin being moved, the community had an ear full to say. Members of the community have even pointed out that whoever this account is registered to could be a whale waiting to sell, this statement is back by a few example sources. In February 2018; the trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, of the infamous Mt. Gox exchange sold 18 000 BTC, this caused a market crash the following day. Again in April; two unidentified entities moved more than 6000 BTC which again resulted in a crash; there were regulation rulings and other political problems circulating which may have affected the markets. It is also believed that the account belongs to the exchange itself, BitMex, although this is not confirmed and could lead to another Mt. Gox legacy. Others believe this movement of money could have been the reason for the $6000 to $6400 bump, engaging the markets with some proper stimulation. Whatever the reason may be for this BTC shift, the account has stayed static which may be a good thing or even allow for more hypotheses to arise rising FUD.

**What next?**

Although crypto is a volatile place in which no person knows the next outcome, people should not stray away from the technology they believe in simply because of the price. Regardless of the outcome, the bitcoin community can overcome more than economic suppression, the power in crypto is people. The influx of bitcoin into the markets may be an invite for more ordinary investors to take charge and up their crypto balances. Whichever way the markets turn, the community will be there to ensure its success and free the world from the financial burden fiat has created. Take the advice of the community, buy the dip and hodl to the moon.",1534500827,17/08/2018 10:13:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9812ou/114_million_usd_worth_of_bitcoin_moved_to_bitmex/,1

Will bitcoin / cryptocurrency be affected because of World Bank's adoption of blockchain?,"I am wondering how the World Banks's adoption of blockchain would affect cryptocurrency. I understand that bitcoin is decentralized and that no single bank can control or manipulate it. I am starting to think though that perhaps newer technology will be able to change that somehow. Is that possible? I do not know much about the technicalities of it, just theories so please enlighten me. 

Also, maybe it is a good thing that the World Bank is adopting blockchain and that it is good for everyone because it might influence other banks into adopting it, letting us end-users enjoy its benefits?",1534501916,17/08/2018 10:31:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98163l/will_bitcoin_cryptocurrency_be_affected_because/,1

2 Hot Takes,"First and foremost, the bull market we experienced is justifiably on par with the dot.com boom by what I notice as parity in what I would define as manic spontaneity of minimal effort/reward. A lot of people made a Mother-fucking fortune doing next to nothing and not needing to be overly intelligent by owning btc before 09
(That's dope if you did and you'll forever be an og but that coulda been anyone that got into E-gold, ecash liberty reserve, digicash, etc had they gotten off the ground.) 
That spontaneity of ease in making money was unrealistically easy and euphoric with Btc alone nevermind alt season. The feelings and preconceived notion that a lot of people are stuck with are pretty parralel with what it seems that a lot of folk got at the end of the dot.com. Hearing about suicides and people financially and emotional bankrupting themselves is shitty and also happened with  dot.com boom. Its fascinating at a psychological level and revolutionary as the internet in terms of hype, utility and skeptical uncertainty.

Blockchain + Smart Contract: Promoting the Rapid Development of Tourism Electronic Contracts,"The blockchain and smart contracts complement each other. The blockchain travel platform, which was born out of blockchain technology, has been closely linked with smart contracts and has joined hands with the blockchain to promote the rapid development of tourism electronic contracts.

The word ""contract"" is familiar to us. To buy a house and buy a car, you need to sign a contract. If you need to sign a labor contract, you need to sign a service contract. The most basic function of the contract is to protect the rights of both parties. So what is the difference and advantage between the smart contract of the blockchain and the paper contract we usually sign?

The first to propose the concept of ""smart contract"" is computer scientist and cryptographer Nick Saab. His definition of smart contract is: a smart contract is a set of promises defined in digital form. This includes agreements on which contract participants can implement these commitments.

We are going to travel now. Most of them are trading through the OTA platform. They agree directly with the above agreement. Sometimes they may not look at it at all. In many cases, the system will automatically check the default, in case of hidden consumption or damage to us. In the interest, because the terms are not clear beforehand, and the initiative of the terms is in the hands of the platform, the final rights will be very difficult.

In contrast to the intelligent contract of the blockchain, it is possible to intelligently judge the trigger condition. Just as we grab the doll machine and coin in, it will automatically start and complete the action. It does not involve the impact of the timeliness and accuracy of human judgment.

For blockchain tour operators, it is also possible to reduce costs. If it is a traditional contract, it requires manpower and resources to sign, supervise and execute, and the terms and conditions of execution in the smart contract are written in advance. , do not need to repeat the operation each time.

For consumers, the biggest advantage is that it can not be falsified and disciplinary. If the consumer encounters an inconsistency with the previous agreement during the tour, because the contract is recorded in different blocks on the “chain” of the blockchain travel platform, the record is not tamperable, and no human intervention or modification will occur. The disciplinary nature of a smart contract is that it depends on assets with digital attributes, and if a breach occurs, the party that defaults will suffer asset losses.

The essential difference between a smart contract and a traditional contract can be described in a real-life scenario. If I book a hotel on the OTA platform, the usual operation process is to select the product and check the agreement to make the payment directly. The platform may be inconspicuous. Place some hidden consumption, or the terms on the platform are not clear. If I find that the hotel I booked is different from the platform description, I have been treated unfairly, and I want to recover my loss, then I will be very passive. .

And if I booked a hotel in the blockchain travel platform - LEOOY, the smart contract has the hotel's usage time, terms of service and service content, then I just need to transfer the assets in the digital wallet to the smart contract, you can enjoy During this time, the hotel's right to use and say good service content, and the blockchain will permanently record the operation records, the information is transparent and open, and there is no human intervention in traditional contracts.

At present, the biggest drawback of the tourism industry is the contradiction between the service provider-platform-consumer in the behavioral norms and the charging problem. It is also one of the places where the supervision is lacking. The blockchain tourism platform has been widely concerned in the tourism industry. The advantages will be discovered by more and more people, thus promoting the rapid development of tourism electronic contracts.",1534513138,17/08/2018 13:38:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/982c3a/blockchain_smart_contract_promoting_the_rapid/,1

"Resorted old wallet.dat file, unsure why no balance?","I realized last night I had a bitcoin wallet backup from several years ago, I followed a guide that told me to just replace the wallet.dat file in my install directory (happens to be my D drive) ,then let it sync.   


On the right I can see that I've received funds to the account, but the balance shows still as 0 bitcoins.

 Just wondering If im understanding this correctly and is there something I need todo?   


 I don't see why I would back something up if I had no money in it, because adding what it looks like I've received on the right is $15k in bitcoins right (3.1)?

Bitcoin for Wedding Registry,"My fiancee and I would like to add bitcoin to our wedding registry.

We would like to set up an easy way for those not comfortable personally buying bitcoin and sending to our bitcoin address.

Is there a service that allows guests to buy bitcoin gift cards that we can redeem in bitcoin? The link below shows such a service but we are trying to find one that operates in the U.S as well and allows online purchases of gift cards. 
https://bitit.io/redeem

Is there a service that allows guests to buy bitcoin and automatically deposit it into our address? 

We are going to place our bitcoin address on the site and a Coinbase referral link for those who already know or are interested in learning how to use bitcoin.

Bitcoin is good.

But Bitcoin is still thriving. It's useful. It's working.

And governments are not trying very hard to crush it. They only tax it very badly (in US you need to declare capital gains on every coffee purchase). This is annoying, but it's still not that bad (compared to banning it like illegal drugs).

Why?

Tether is useful for many people in trading with Bitcoin. Why they are allowing it to exist? It's easy to freeze the bank accounts (steal the money) like they did with Liberty Reserve and e-gold.

"Anonymity isn't something Bitcoin can give you, but it can protect it if you already have it.","I keep hearing people talking about Bitcoin's anonymity. Bitcoin cannot *be anonymous* and it cannot give you anonymity either. Anonymity is something that you have to provide for yourself and practice *all the time*. Every single time you connect to the internet you can behave in ways that put your privacy and anonymity first and foremost. You can use tools like encrypted VPN and the Tor network religiously. You can abstain from all forms of social media interactions or posting anything that could be used to identify you. These days you very nearly are required to train your mind like a ninja so as to be continuously aware of the myriad bits of self-identifying data being leaked by your particular internet habits all the time. However, if you did do all the right things, if you trained your mind to be an online shadow ninja, if you completely erased or disconnected yourself from any personally identifying data at all ... and used bitcoin ... then for you, yes, bitcoin *is anonymous*. My point is that most people miss the point about what anonymity actually is. It's something that *you* have to have not something bitcoin has as some sort of de-facto design feature. If you are not anonymous when you use bitcoin, no anonymity can possibly be granted to you by the blockchain. However, if you are careful to protect your anonymity then bitcoin will not spoil your efforts. It can't. Not because *it's anonymous* but because *you* are.

Uranus in Taurus effects on bitcoin,"Disclaimer: This is just for fun.

Uranus in Taurus foretold last year's run-up in BTC.

Now that we are in Uranus in Taurus as of May 2018, we have 8 years of transformation we are going through through 2026.  Uranus retrogrades end of the year but then goes back into Taurus early next year for a solid 6+ years.  

During those 6+ years, we will see the following:

Lightning/etc, aka MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE, becomes wisely usable by the average joe.  This will launch BTC to $100k+

Then we will see a bear after that hype.  With a price perhaps bottoming to ~$30k(?)

Following, we will see Lightning and other bitcoin improvements gain mass adoption to the point where bitcoin becomes a UNIT OF ACCOUNT.  This will drive the price to $1 million+.  

And then perhaps another bear.  Until 2032 where most of the supply (~99%) will have been mined and it will stabilize above $1 million+ value.

Remember, wisely used money has 3 attributes.

1. Store of Value (which bitcoin is now)
2. Medium of Exchange (which Lightning/etc is working on)
3. Unit of Account (which comes after the former 2 are established firmly)",1534551311,18/08/2018 00:15:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/987euv/uranus_in_taurus_effects_on_bitcoin/,1

Lightning/etc, aka MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE, becomes widely accessible/relatively user-friendly by the average joe. This will launch BTC to $100k+

Then we will see a bear after that hype. With a price perhaps bottoming to ~$30k(?)

Following, we will see Lightning and other bitcoin improvements gain mass adoption to the point where bitcoin becomes a UNIT OF ACCOUNT. This will drive the price to $1 million+.

And then perhaps another bear. Until 2032 when practically the entire supply (~99%) will have been mined and it will stabilize above $1 million+ value.

Remember, wisely used money has 3 attributes.

1. Store of Value (which bitcoin is now)
2. Medium of Exchange (which Lightning/etc is working on)

"Tuesday, August 21st, 2018 in San Diego - Bitcoin is not money will be decided.","On Tuesday, August 21st, 2018, a hearing in San Diego will take place where they will debate whether Bitcoin is Money.

The whole debate are lay in documents #25, #26 and #27.

Are Venezuela preparing a big pump and dump to take bitcoins?,"Maduro just announced that the minimum wage for Venezuelans its 0.5 Petro(the state issued “crypto currency”)  which has an imposed value of 60$. This means that Venezuela's new minimum wage went from 1$ to 30$ 3000% just by decrete, that also would imply that most of no minimum wagers are going to be minimum wages, no industry can afford this, unemployment will skyrocket (more) besides the promise of the government yo create payrolls for all minors and medium companies, this also lets them chose which company will survive or not. Why are they doing this? Are they crazy?

  I’m pretty sure that they’re not. This made me think about what could be behind this madness around the Petro and I’ll share some may be paranoid thoughts. 
  It makes sense to me that they’ll try to give the Petro some value, it could be a joint effort with allied governments (Rusia, China), they will let Venezuelans buy petros without any currency control in order to later exchange it to any other asset but first they ‘legitimate’ it as currency, doing some international deals with allies, like buying medicines with petros, that’s also a point  because trying to block a medicine shipment to a country in need doesn’t seem very well. Also they can open a retail marketplace based in petros yo increase and incentivate adoption among Venezuelans.

  If petro gets listed in a decent liquidity exchange, these block of countries are powerful enough to discreetly create a bubble of it and then dump it. Take that Bitcoins to keep them in power because that’s the main goal, at least for Venezuela's government.

Next Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Might See Massive Increase of Its Price - coinness.com,"A summary of Bitcoin’s price at the first two block halvings uploaded to Reddit by Telegram news channel What’s On Crypto notes that Bitcoin prices increased by orders of magnitude in each period.

The third halving — due in mid-2020 or in 644 days — will see the block reward reduce from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, while What’s On Crypto suggests ongoing trends could see prices hit a giant $10 million by 2023.

Opera is Building a Browser-based Crypto Wallet to Reach its 10 Million Users in Africa,"![img](cbup1684ltg11 ""Opera News app now reaches over 10 million across Africa. It is the most popular app in Kenya."")

Opera, through a press release in August 8th, 2018, announced that it is launching a browser that will feature a pre-installed cryptocurrency wallet.

The new browser has come as a result of ‘strong interest’ and “overwhelming positive response from the crypto community” to the mobile crypto wallet which launched in July 2018, according to the press release.

Opera has also already garnered success with its Opera News app in Africa. It will not be a surprise if the company leverages this huge demographic in an effort to introduce and get the crypto-wallet adopted as widely as possible.

Is the realization of the blockchain tourism scene really unrealistic?,"With the continuous development of the tourism industry, tourism has become one of the most violent and largest industries in the global economy. The advent of the Internet-based blockchain era has given rise to new thinking about tourism.

https://i.redd.it/flxwibhxltg11.jpg

In the past, the development of Internet tourism was based on the traditional model. With the help of online third-party platforms, the credit was in the hands of third parties. Nowadays, people in the blockchain have seen the possibility of different tourism industries. Blockchain technology integration, blockchain tourism or will become one of the most promising scenarios for blockchain technology.

https://i.redd.it/ur8769i2mtg11.png

From the rapid rise of the domestic blockchain tourism platform of Tripio and LEOOY, it can be seen that the blockchain technology can not only be used in the financial field. The role of tourism in the economic construction is equivalent to the role of transportation for human beings. It is one of the driving forces for the steady and rapid development of the economy. The blockchain must be well established in the application of the tourism industry. After all, the situation promotes innovation, who can approach the perfect satisfaction of the needs of consumers, who has the words right.

https://i.redd.it/o8oeb1syltg11.jpg

As the saying goes, after the waves of the Yangtze River push the waves, the defects of the traditional OTA are obvious to all. In today's chaos, we use blockchain technology to realize the lower cost, faster and safer cross-border secure payment method to deal with the tourism industry. In the scope of business-to-business transactions, the third-party intermediary links are eliminated, and point-to-point docking is achieved, thereby reducing costs and completing transactions quickly. LEOOY, using the decentralization of blockchain technology, simplifies all complicated procedures, such as commodity transactions, hotel and air ticket bookings, and faithfully records every transaction that occurs on a distributed ledger. And this record information is in the hands of all people involved in the development of blockchain, so on the blockchain platform, these data can not be arbitrarily falsified.

https://i.redd.it/0v9blbizltg11.png

The matching between blockchain technology and tourism scenes is relatively high. LEOOY is also aware of this, and has created a platform that is more in line with consumer needs. Based on the important characteristics of blockchain, the future is in tourism. Applications will focus on decentralization and security trust. For consumers, the application of blockchain technology allows consumers and service providers to “zero-distance contact”, thereby eliminating dependence on intermediaries and greatly improving their service quality.

https://i.redd.it/q8ya0rf0mtg11.png

In the end, the concept of the sky is still to be tested by the actual project, but for now, the development trend of blockchain tourism is still very strong. From 2014 to 2018, now everyone no longer doubts the block. Chain technology will become an important part of the future world. Subversion cannot be achieved overnight. It is often grown into a towering tree in an unknown corner.

Bitcoin Prices could get higher," The technical charts continue to call a rally to $7K despite bitcoin showing signs of exhaustion around $6,500.  

BTC remains on the hunt of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,715. A bullish breakout, if confirmed, would validate the bearish-to-bullish trend change suggested by the 4-hour chart and allow a sustained move above $7,000.

On the downside, a break below $6,213 (low of the right shoulder of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern) would abort the bullish view.",1534592057,18/08/2018 11:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98b26d/bitcoin_prices_could_get_higher/,1

Maybe we see a new hybrid highly pruned type of node?

Maybe 5G will play a role?

Maybe an encrypted node in the cloud?

Anyone know of ideas in the pipeline?

Lost my bitcoin last night..due to my gullibility.,"Last night I came across Elon Musks twitter and saw that he had done an interview with a YouTuber. I clicked on the tweet and in the comment section there was a link to a page that said Bitcoin and Ethereum giveaway. The link was tweeted by Elon Musk himself, or so I thought. I clicked on the link and it took me to a page where it had his name and two different links: one for Bitcoin giveaway and the other for Ethereum. 
I clicked on the Bitcoin and the page said “To participate donate .05 to 2 BTC and get back .5 to 20 BTC.” To me this sounded great. I only had .05 in my account, so I thought I would enter it and win big. I was convinced this was legit because it was showing all the transactions under it. People were putting in 0.02 and getting back 3BTC and so on. I entered with the expectation of getting more right away but nothing was happening. 
I wait around 5-10 minutes before getting really suspicious. I went back to the tweet and saw that the “Elon Musk” account was not real. It was verified but it wasn’t the real Elon. I lost all of by BTC and now I’m kinda pissed about it. 
Let this be a lesson to everyone here, don’t do these stupid “giveaways” cause you’ll get burned in the end. ",1534595623,18/08/2018 12:33:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98bd7l/lost_my_bitcoin_last_nightdue_to_my_gullibility/,1

Lost all my Bitcoin due to my own gullibility,"Last night I came across Elon Musks twitter and saw that he had done an interview with a YouTuber. I clicked on the tweet and in the comment section there was a link to a page that said Bitcoin giveaway. The link was tweeted by Elon Musk himself, or so I thought. I clicked on the link and it took me to a page where it had his name and two different links: one for Bitcoin giveaway and the other for a different coin. I clicked on the Bitcoin and the page said “To participate donate .05 to 2 BTC and get back .5 to 20 BTC.” To me this sounded great. I only had .05 in my account, so I thought I would enter it and win big. I was convinced this was legit because it was showing all the transactions under it. People were putting in 0.02 and getting back 3BTC and so on. 
    
I entered with the expectation of getting more right away but nothing was happening. I wait around 5-10 minutes before getting really suspicious. I went back to the tweet and saw that the “Elon Musk” account was not real. It was verified but it wasn’t the real Elon. I lost all of by BTC and now I’m kinda pissed about it. Let this be a lesson to everyone here, don’t do these stupid “giveaways” cause you’ll get burned in the end.",1534608780,18/08/2018 16:13:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98csoh/lost_all_my_bitcoin_due_to_my_own_gullibility/,1

Do you think there will ever be a day when Bitcoin is no longer #1 on CMC?...,"...or do you honestly see it as the undisputed reigning champion for as long as the cryptocurrency market exists?

I've been thinking about this question more and more recently, and I'm starting to think there is a very realistic possibility that BTC may not be the top coin at some point in the not-too-distant future. I know... crazy, right?... But maybe not *bat-shit* crazy. So exactly how long am I talking here? Well, I'm not sure... but historically speaking, there are plenty of examples where a technology with first movers advantage has not been able to sustain its lead in market dominance (Motorola being the first company to introduce handheld cell phones to the masses, comes to mind).

I can download blocks ,  I just can't receive incoming requests. A little bit about my system :

How to calculate the GBTC premium (Bitcoin Investment Trust),"I think this is the right formula. Type it into TradingView.com to view the chart.

    100*(GBTC/0.00099727-BTCUSD)/BTCUSD

1 GBTC share contains 0.00099727 bitcoins.

Currently it is about 40%. I forecast that it will continue to decrease because of the available alternatives becoming more popular (real Bitcoins on hardware wallet, Bitcoin ETN, Bitcion ETF).

Discuss: On the 1st September BCH has planned a Stress Test - It should ALSO include BTC,"So I wanted a healthy discussion on the upcoming stress test, the arguments  for and against.  **Please comment below and share your thoughts, if you agree or disagree**



-


-

 

Comparablity

BCH target is aroung 5 milliom transactions on a day. 

But what does this actually prove? - It can handle 5m on-chain tx, so what? 

It HAS to be compared and benchmarked against BTC to make the results meaningful and directly comparable. 



Awareness:

Overall if BTC can also match that or have a same end result. This will ultimately PROVE and confirm,  how BCH is nowhere near close to BTC. 

Then people can realise how BTC is always king. 



-


Agreements against: 

It will require significant investment - who cares most of you are loaded 

It will require additional time and effort - to prove your king, it should be fine. 


**I strongly think the benefits outweigh the risks and long term it will help BTC prove its king**

🔥ELI5 How to Spot Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunities in Real-time &amp; Trade them Like a Pro? Wouldn’t One Whale be able take up all the Volume?,"First I want to give you a brief intro of myself... Last November - December I started noticing arbitrage opportunities occurring quite frequently in cryptocurrency markets just before and during the bull run and it is happening all over again! I was able to capitalize off of every single arbitrage deal I ever acted on... 20% or more each time in a matter of minutes. This led me to create my own arbitrage platform so I can could get alerted to these arbitrage occurrences in real-time. Here is a nice strategy I developed I 'd like to share with everyone...

##⏰ Be Ready at all times

* having money in **USD or BTC** ready at all times on the exchanges you are comfortable arbitraging on 

* get an arbitrage alert platform that gets you the info you need to see the quickest 

* once you spot an arbitrage opportunity or get an alert act on it as fast as you can



##🤔 Follow this quick checklist:

✔️ act on HIGH VOLUME arbitrage opportunities (unless you are investing small amounts which is supported by the current volume)

✔️ act ONLY on arbitrage opportunities based on profit potential of 13% or more

✔️ MAKE SURE WALLETS ARE ONLINE on both exchanges

✔️ buy as many coins you desire from the exchange it is selling much cheaper while paying attention to make sure the spread still exists by checking the exchange it is selling for at a much higher rate

✔️ once you are done accumulating, transfer to the other exchange and sell as fast as you can 


&gt;From my experience I was able to transfer most coins in 7-10 minutes time and sell them pretty fast (40k worth) over a few minutes time. Some coins are known to transfer fast so it is wise to be familiar with coin transfer times. There are some that transferred on average of 15 minutes to 30 minutes although one time it took 3 hours but I was still able to make at least 18% or more every arbitrage opportunity I ever acted on. 

## ❓ Let's talk about why arbitrage opportunities occur?

A seasoned trader will understand that most coin prices begin to rise when breaking certain resistances and trend lines. News will sometimes create arbitrage opps but they are mainly caused by huge money being pumped into coins by institutions. They are usually the start of bull runs. Last December we seen that most coins chart displayed extremely bullish patterns. Once they broke resistance it usually rockets up to a higher price and usually starts forming a new pattern that will allow the price to go even higher. The amounts of cash flowing into coins at a much faster rate creates a spread between exchanges which creates an arbitrage opportunity.



## 🐋 Let me debunk the misconception that one whale can eat up all the volume for himself using an arbitrage opportunity that happened just yesterday

A few months ago **ADX BTC** was pumped up over 65%. It was trading for **$1.19** on Bittrex and **$1.47** on Bittrex which is around a 25% or more price spread between the exchanges. The **24 hour volume** on **ADX BTC** on Binance alone was over [**$51 million dollars** most of which was traded during the arbitrage opportunity](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*4_M7O1xV8ItuSFipsmeD4g.png). That is a ton of volume for literally thousands of people to make a profit from by swapping these coins between exchanges. I usually trade around 40k at a time during these occurrences and I have no trouble getting my orders filled in minutes while transferring and selling on the other exchange.

## 📈  Arbitrage opportunities are common before the start of and during bull runs

Arbitrage occurrences usually occur at the beginning of bull markets and we are beginning to see them occur more and more on high volume exchanges. This is how we see the market caps rise and prices of coins go up so quickly...  Today there was another that occurred for ticker **DNT BTC** this time it had even more volume roughly **$70 million dollars** worth on Binance alone. Unfortunately I was watching the movie ""A Quiet Place"" at the movie theatre so I wasn't able to act on the alert I received. 

Feel free to ask me whatever questions you wish!

You are a broker in Japan. You are Thai. So you want to see all views in terms of Thai Baht. Even the sellers in Japan.

Your business partner is Japanese. They ask what is going on with our selling in Thailand. The Thai broker can switch the UI to show everything in terms of yen. So the Japanese can feel like the entire world is Japan and there are no such thing as foreign people.

A buyer wants to pay in CNY. Another in KRW. Those trade requests would be more easily understood by presenting them in the broker's preferred local currency",1534638637,19/08/2018 00:30:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98gbau/otc_bitcoin_broker_app_update/,1

Do you ever use Decentralized Exchanges or Attomic Swap?,"I love to trade crypto and I have been at it for almost 4 years. I personally love using decentralized exchanges that basically allow for trading to happen essentially between wallets without needing to deposit or withdrawal from a third party.

I think it's great but i find that very few people use the DEXs that I frequent or if they do use them the volumes are incredibly low.
I'm not sure why this is, would some of the people who trade crypto around here let me know what their thoughs are on using these platformes and what it is that keeps them from using them or keeps them using with similar volumes as they would on a traditional exchange.

BIP Draft via [bitcoin-dev] mailing list - Suggestion for a universal bitcoin value scale,"#Abstract

A universal bitcoin value color scale is presented here as a way to creating an easy visual aid for insuring correct amounts in transactions.
#Motivation

The motivation behind this BIP is in line with BIP 176 by Jimmy Song. The bitcoin price has grown over the years and once the price is past $10,000 USD or so, bitcoin amounts under $10 USD start having enough decimal places that it's difficult to tell whether the user is off  by a factor of 10 or not. This proposal is a supplement to the BIP 176, utilizing the digital nature of bitcoin, to allow a visual aid in the bitcoin transactions. This is doing to insure a common understanding of the amount in question between the parties trading.

Potential benefits of utilizing "" A universal bitcoin value color scale"" include:

1. Reduce user error on bitcoin amounts.
2. Allow easier comparisons of prices for most users.
3. Using a visual aid makes transactions easier for people with dyscalculia.
4. Allow easier bi-directional comparisons to altcoins and fiat currencies.

"[AMA] Randy Brito here from BitcoinVenezuela.com, what we’ve been doing and why we might need your help","Hello all here, I am Randy Brito (aka @btcven), a Venezuelan whose family moved to Spain in 2004 due to the worsening situation and persecution on the middle class.

I learned about Bitcoin in 2011 and read a lot about it here and at Bitcointalk.org (and learned about Libertarianism too through it), in 2012 founded https://www.BitcoinVenezuela.com as a non-profit organization dedicated to educate about Bitcoin and basic economics.

Started collaborating with Electrum developers, translated it into Spanish (along with Hive Wallet, MacWallet, and some others). At Electrum also helped as manager of translations, website, social media, support.

Co-founded another local non-profit education group in Spain and gave talks about Bitcoin around the country, mostly in high schools to get the young people started before they even learned how to use a bank account. Also co-founded a Classic Liberal - Anarchocapitalist group in Seville, Spain where I was part of the team which hosted the Free Market Road Show three years in a row.

In 2014 joined Support at Coinbase as one of the two first employees outside the US, when it was still only serving US customers, and worked there for 3.5 years. Joined MetaMask-ConsenSys a few months ago as Customer Support.

Tried to open a Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;Bolivar exchange between 2014-2015, we got stopped and the other local exchange there got shut down completely.

I’ve been educating about Bitcoin in Venezuela since 2012, in our website, in social media, with collaborators in the country who gave talks, supporting local groups teaching about Bitcoin there, running campaigns, giving interviews, podcasts. Besides trying to educate about economics, fighting Socialism both in Venezuela and Spain, and more.

For more than two years now I’ve been collecting donations in cryptocurrencies through our humanitarian aid project 'Bitcoin For Venezuela Initiative' to help feed people, buy medicines and help those in need. We started doing a monthly activity to cook food for 400-500 people. Today we help feed 2000+ people daily, by buying food for a soup kitchen where 1600+ people go to eat daily, probably the only meal they have in a whole day. Also cook meals for two orphanages, an elderly center, a kids hospital, and an old people’s hospital. This is the last activity we did: https://twitter.com/btcven/status/1028743266739662849?s=21

We are now also helping another soup kitchen and an elderly center in a small town, and also managing donations to restore a farm school, so it can produce food again for the towns around it, and also teach young people to work in the farm. Donations come mostly from private donators giving us cryptocurrencies, not many donations come from our public addresses (we take Bitcoin Lightning Network donations too!) because we keep most of the pictures and videos taken private because of the persecution in the country of those who do humanitarian aid, and for the safety of collaborators on the ground.

For the past months I’ve been working on speeding up Bitcoin adoption in Venezuela ( checkout these 4 tweets https://twitter.com/randybrito/status/1023679503862824962?s=21 ) through a few steps:

- Get funds to develop a very simple UI to make it easy to start using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange using Electrum for Android. Adapt censorship resistant tools being developed so they work for Electrum users too.

- Teach people how to use it and let them know about the different ways of turning Bitcoin to other currencies as store of value (like Dollars, stablecoins, or any synthetic USD) and also use Dollars as unit of account so they can completely stop using Bolivars.

- Develop a DIY cheap device to make a mesh network in Venezuela that could be used not only for secure communications, but more importantly for transacting with Bitcoin even if/when all communications (3G, SMS, calls, cable-internet) stop working (as it has been happening these past weeks). Small router-like nodes with medium WiFi range to connect to others, bigger ones with radio antennas attached to them to connect larger distances, a few of them in the borders with Internet connection and Electrum servers adapted to serve users through the mesh directly. We’ll have a working prototype in ~1 month.

- Continue adapting and developing the needed tools for Venezuelans (also Iran and Turkey are now in/towards a similar situation) to be able to actually use Bitcoin for everyday censorship resulting payments through this mesh privately and securely.

- Research, adapt, collaborate, and promote second layer solutions like the Lightning Network that will let millions of users transact with each other once an important percentage of for example the people of Venezuela use Bitcoin payments every day. This research for example has let us understand that the mesh network devices could have a LN node routing payments through the mesh and make those hosting the mesh devices earn a bit of the fees collected, and even host an IPFS node too.

This project-effort is called Locha

We need your help and support to make this happen.

TIL Bitcoin not Blockchain,"Jimmy Song famously said ""Bitcoin not Blockchain"" at Consensus 2018.

Antonpoulos said something to the effect of ""it's become very trendy to say 'I believe in blockchain but not Bitcoin', and those who say that probably don't understand what they're talking about.""

Wences Casares also said something to similar effect.

3 very reputable names all saying it. I blindly agreed with them, but truthfully I didn't fully understand it either. Obviously Bitcoin has an astounding hashrate which lends to it's highly impenetrable nature. But what finally clicked is it's about the Maximum version of Trust. Blockchain is about Trusted \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 

To say you believe in Blockchain but not Bitcoin is like saying I like trusted applications but I don't like trusted money. It doesn't make sense. If you want to create something of trust, start with something fundamental like money. That's why it's the most obvious application. Money is at the root of almost everyones everyday lives.

The concept further clicked for me when I thought about using *speed* as a close analogy. Top speed and horsepower are two numbers that will never go out of style. The commonality is these numbers represents the *maximum values* which coincidentally makes them great *benchmarks* to value everything else against.

With Bitcoin it's the same thing. Bitcoin represents the maximum level of trust amongst all Blockchain technologies. *Hashrate* is the equivalent of horsepower. Bitcoin's relevance as the crypto king remains a constant because it represents the maximum form of the entire category giving it inherent high value as well as making it the defacto coin to benchmark all the rest against. 

The point is when you talk about Bitcoin, you're talking about the absolute maximum level of Trust and that will never go out of style just like top Speed. Hope this helps some of you who are trying to wrap your minds around that ""Bitcoin not blockchain"" statement.",1534664434,19/08/2018 07:40:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98io3a/til_bitcoin_not_blockchain/,1

To those who think the decline of the Lira will boost the bitcoin price,"You're probably right, but mostly in the long run.

At the end of 2015 my nation's currency, the South African Rand, lost 30% of its value in a week. That's when I first bought bitcoin - as a hedge against sovereign fiat collapse. I had value at stake, so I bought Mastering Bitcoin and began to learn. A few months later I sold all the equities I had in banking to buy bitcoin. Over the next two years I'd proceed to only save into cryptocurrencies. Now I work full-time in the field and live almost entirely off crypto, and I know many people with a similar story. Whilst those who brought us the moon and bought in December to get rich quick also panic sold quick.

These economic shocks won't create price pumps overnight, but they do teach people the lesson of why a censorship-resistant decentralised store of value is important, which will lead to long-term (in crypto-time) adoption.",1534669031,19/08/2018 08:57:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98izjh/to_those_who_think_the_decline_of_the_lira_will/,1

"Controversial hard fork - how to determine ""real"" bitcoin","How would ""the real Bitcoin"" be determined in a controversial hard fork? 

Does the economic majority always rule? If so, by most accumulated hash, or by highest price?

What if the economic majority followed a fork with major technological changes that damaged the integrity of the blockchain (i.e. coin limit changed to over 21M)?

Is there a strict way to define ""the real Bitcoin"" or does it not even matter?

My Bitcoin Story (all started 7 years ago). I will remain faithful,"I would like to share my story with my fellow bitcoin redditors.  First off, I really appreciate this community.  While I haven't been on reddit extremely long, I have followed this subreddit since its inception and have learned a great deal of information from the truly great people. 

I am a 26 year old male who journeyed into Bitcoin when I was 19 years old. I remember I heard about the blockchain technology and bitcoin by clicking the wrong video on YouTube (I have always been into consumer technology and LOVE tech gadgets... I clicked the video on accident for a suggested video that YouTube made for me on the sidebar).  I was enamored by the technology, but to say that I understood what the hell I was listening to would be lying.  I started to watch more and more videos and read more and more articles about Bitcoin.  It boggled my mind that this existed... I read that it was used mainly on the dark web, which led me to research about a side of the internet that I had no idea existed (I'm sure some of you pictured that iceberg meme showing the internet that we know as the tip of the iceberg and the remaining part of the iceberg as the deep web).  While I was not interested in utilizing the deep web, Bitcoin and the blockchain technology made me believe that this could be a huge gamechanger to the way things are paid for in the future.  I was sold, I had to support this technology, but how, I had no money! I was always good at saving my money, I had worked as a lifeguard from the age of 15 years old in the summer time and worked odd jobs while school was in session but my parents not only instilled in me to be responsible with finances, they also taught me that life is what you make it and that there are no handouts in life.  This is something that I really appreciate and made me the man I am today...but back to the story...I had spent the money I had saved up because unfortunately, literally a month prior, was in a car accident and had paid for the damages to my car and we did not go through insurance so I paid out of pocket for the bumper and left tail light for the other car..... what car you ask?........ a fucking 2009 Ferrari F430 who stopped dead in the road and I did not have enough time to react. You cant even understand the fear that I felt in that moment.. I thought I would be screwed for a very long time to come, but luckily had enough savings to pull myself up and not ask for a dime from my parents.

Anyway, since I had no savings now and really wanted to support this technology, something I became so passionate about .. I had to ask my parents for help..  I spoke to my mom (she made the final decisions in the family, my dad would always say ""ask your mom"") and pleaded with her to just loan me a couple thousand (I know, ballsy, but I truly believed in the tech).. I begged for weeks and tried to explain what bitcoin was and how this is the ground floor of the technology and I really want to be in it, not to make money, but to support this change .  I remember I kept saying that no one knows what bitcoin is in the mainstream media but it is like when the internet came about and was available for the average consumer but no one really knew what it was.  My mom said, I dont know what you are saying (I am very bad at describing what things do) but life has no handouts, if you want this, work harder and use your money so you do not owe anything to anyone in this world.  Which thinking back on it, it was rather harsh.. they could have given me a few dollars but I digress.  I spent that year working my ass off, after all was said and done, I only had about $3,000 to buy bitcoin with but it was enough!!! I was excited and finally able to get my bitcoins, by the time I got the money to do it (I could have just bought periodically, but I dont know, I wanted to have money to buy all of them in one shot, a mistake, but whatever) a bitcoin was worth around $13.52, I was the proud owner of about 229 bitcoins.  Which seems like a ton now, but it seemed very little at the time to me but I was in the game.

I feel bad for whoever is reading this long thing, so I will start to wrap it up and let you know how things unfolded.  I was a huge believer as I previously stated and I was not in it for the quick buck because that was even in the cards then, I bought bitcoins to spend them, to use them as I should (not that I am against people who just invest to make money, but I do believe that you should believe in the tech and now just a get rich quick scheme).  I spend bitcoins to buy things that I needed for college and fun things, keep in mind, I spent bitcoins for less than the value that I paid for them since the fluctuations were serious.  Then something happened, an illness in the family, not my immediate family, but my friend who I considered a brother...this was around the time bitcoin was at around $600.00.. His family did not have the means to pay for a surgery that was needed and I honestly thought it was a no brainier to fund the surgery.  At the time, pretty much all of the bitcoins were used to pay for the surgery.  He did not make it, unfortunately... The parents have offered to pay me back and they have given me some money back (I dont have a high paying job but I am comfortable) and I told them that is all that I needed, they do not owe me the whole amount.  I just realized I am wayyyy off track with this as I basically used this as my journal and forgot this was going on reddit.  Sorry to be a downer but I figured I would keep that story in as it has made me re-think the most important things in life.  The most important things in life are time and to do and support something you believe in.  I have 2 bitcoins in my ledger and have spent money for other altcoins for the technology that they bring to the table.  I am not saying all this to make you feel bad for me, you absolutely should not and that is not what you should take out of this post.  I am incredibly lucky to still be a part of supporting such an amazing technology.  I would do everything all over again if I had to.  My goal for 2018 is to put more of my money up when I have it.  Bitcoin is not dying, Bitcoin is more alive than ever. Just look at the media... we are on the front page of the freaking WSJ almost every day, if you would have told me that in 2011.... I would have said..... it's about damn time. It is every one of you that makes it possible for it to live, whether you are using it to become rich, or using it to pay for things... you are supporting this.  My advice for those just investing to get rich, please take the time our and do the research to learn the positives that comes with Bitcoin, they are extraordinary.  Again, this post was not to feel bad for me, although, reading this post back now, it definitely got a little off track, but these stories were to portray my unwavering belief that Bitcoin will become so normal as the years go on and this is because of what it can offer.. trust the tech, trust the math.

TLDR- Bitcoin has changed my life.  Please understand the technology behind it and you will remove all doubts.  It is not if bitcoin becomes the preferred payment method in the world, but when.  Time is the most important thing we have in this life, give bitcoin the time to flourish... believe me it will.",1534684181,19/08/2018 13:09:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98k4ga/my_bitcoin_story_all_started_7_years_ago_i_will/,1

Understanding Manipulation,"It is easier to manipulate a stock when its volume is low. All a manipulator needs to do is execute a few carefully timed trades to create the illusion that a stock is moving so he can get others to buy or sell. The goal is to raise the price if he wants to sell and to lower the price if he wants to buy. If you are suckered in by such a move, your position can quickly turn into a loss as the stock you just bought suddenly reverses course on increased volume.

Reminder: Bitcoin is still the future.,"I just want to remind you all that are on the fence that bitcoin is still the future.  I've been in the space for a long time.  Working in financial technology, I see first hand the inefficiencies and security risks of the current system.  No matter how bad you think the current system is, it's worse. 

When I started bitcoin I believed in the technology because I could see the code and understood how it functioned.  It was an obvious innovation that should have taken off far faster than it has in my mind.  Ultimately, I lost faith in this society.  I didn't believe in the people -- the common people -- and their ability to understand what freedom looks like.  I made a lot of money with it, but when Mt. Gox happened, I thought that greed bred ignorance, and ignorance would kill our revolution.

But we are still here.  I've been watching for a long time, and I've been waiting for the great corruption of our leaders to kill this.  Yet...it's still here.  I was expecting the internet to shut down, for crypto to be outlawed, for massive censorship to take over, for mandatory backdoors bypassing all crypto, yet none of that happened.

I don't claim to be smart socially, I just know code.  I've been very happy that I'm wrong.

Our governments have become irrelevant with the advent of cryptocurrencies and their survival.  While people are bickering about trivial political action from powerless governmental institutions built upon blood and corruption, we have a trustless mechanism of exchange without intermediaries.  That still hasn't sunk in.  We are still in the beginning.

Bitcoin isn't gold.  Gold is not a scarce resource.  There is an infinite amount of gold in this universe.  Stop thinking globally and start thinking universally.  We will find asteroids made of gold, planets with gold cores, nebulas with particulate gold spanning lightyears.  Do you know how many bitcoin we will find in the universe?  21 million.  There is no material substance we can state that with.  Not a single one.  Do not make such a dumb comparison.

Any material comparison people make against bitcoin is a bad one, but don't you see?  We are all cursed with tradition.  We'll catch up eventually, but for most, it'll be too late.  I don't care about bitcoin so that I can later sell it.  I care about it because no one can stand between me and you when we make an exchange.  No one can fake the currency or ""correct"" it when it goes wrong.  There are no bailouts, there are no human decision making that impact the integrity of the system.

You think this is sci-fi still.  You think this is delusion.  Riches are always delusion before they materialize.  The current ""value"" of bitcoin, measured against the fun-money (aka US Dollars, Euros, etc.) of the world, is the true delusion.  When the people that horde the fun-money and manipulate it to their liking jump ship from that sinking vessel, with countless trillions most of us can't comprehend, we won't be measuring bitcoin in terms of cash but in terms of castles.

Bitcoin unlocks the world.

No matter what innovations unfold in this space, no matter how many ""bitcoin killers"" people generate, it will never take the historical and revolutionary seat of bitcoin.  It is strong in its simplicity.  It is the first and it works.  We may not use it in the distant future, but it will always be one of the scarcest, widely distributed currencies in the universe.  Nothing can ever change that.  The game theory that makes it work has been proven stable.

The energy expended to power the network is not a waste.  It will drive more efficient generation of energy as time increases.  Funds will be expended to improve our power grid, to improve our distribution of compute power, to distribute and increase internet bandwidth, to improve chip manufacturing.  It is evolution applied to computation, infrastructure, and digital security.  Any attempts to change the game theory from proof of work is a fraud.  Crypto is similar to a sovereign nation; people who understand it are trying to become kings.  Do not trust it.

Light takes about 13 light minutes to travel to Mars.  Bitcoin will still be relevant even when we travel to Mars, and we will be able to set up massive mining networks there.  When SpaceX builds rockets that can transport us there to colonize and build industry without any environmental regulation, and with 1/3 the gravity of Earth so that all actions take less energy, I will be able to buy industrial materials from Martian industry using bitcoin.

I do not care about this so that I can trade it for money.  When the reaches of space open up to us and the traditional sovereign currencies have collapsed, I care about it so I can be one of the people to buy a seat on the interplanetary spaceships going to Mars and beyond.  When the infinite abundance of space is available to us and material is measured in its cost of transportation vs distance &amp; time, I care about it so I can be one of the 21 million to put a deposit on an immortal body.

While people still think in dollars, I will continue thinking in these terms, as I have since the beginning.  This isn't economics, this is finally physics manifesting in our mechanisms of exchange.  Our first pure capitalism.

This is part of the human story towards our next intelligence singularity.  

What exciting times.

My Bitcoin Story - Journey Of A Bitcoin Developer,"I've just read this other submission here: [My Bitcoin Story (all started 7 years ago). I will remain faithful](https://redd.it/98k4ga), where /u/thecommontheme told his story about journeying into Bitcoin at the beginning of his adult life.  

I've read his story with fascination, because it could've been me. I am the same age, and I also journeyed into Bitcoin in the beginning of my adult life. I also had my fair share of crazy stories, that prevented me to have as much money in Bitcoin as I wanted. However, there were some things I did differently: instead of cashing out for college, I dropped out of college to start working as a junior programmer (meaning: coffee making machine) and buy bitcoins with the salary. At that time Bitcoin was $1000 dollar. At this point and from there on it was just going down for years. I had no patience, so I started travelling the world (working remotely) with the coins I was able to save up, but then I altcoined them all away, so I realized I need to change my mindset: **I started investing my skills into Bitcoin, rather than my money.** And here I am a couple of years later, in the Building Bitcoin conference, presenting my journey as a Bitcoin developer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XORDEX-RrAI&amp;t=17m01s

Anyway, I just wanted to point out the contrast. We started out the same, we are in similar financial situation today, because we made similar bad financial decisions. However the difference is, if Bitcoin crashes tomorrow, if I zero out tomorrow, I will still have the skills I've learned.  

So, if the moral of his story was to hodl. The moral of my story would be hodl and buidl. Enjoy the video!",1534690749,19/08/2018 14:59:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98ksz0/my_bitcoin_story_journey_of_a_bitcoin_developer/,1

Sell Limits,"Looking to sell around 200k worth of bitcoin. Originally bought off Coinbase, I have on a Trezor offline now.

Have held for several years and now need to pay off some long standing debts. HODL has paid off well for me, but a bunch of btc on a trezor does not buy much happiness long term.

My coinbase sell limit is only $15000 per week. Would take me 13 weeks or more then 3 months to sell the amount.

Where can I unload that has higher sell limits / no sell limits that is actually safe to use and is not riddled with stuck money service tickets?

Miningod.com - Shop on Aliexpress using Cryptocurrency,"I've been working on this in my free time. It's in early phase at this moment.. I've added around 1500+ products from Aliexpress to miningod.com and I will be adding new products all the time. 
Design of the website is quiet easy to navigate since it acts like a e-commerce store with dropshipping, but payments are made in Cryptocurrency.

Payment method is Cryotocurrency at this moment, I'm waiting for Skrill Moneybookers to respond about my Skrill Business account so I can add Credit Cards as payment method (Vise, Maestro, MasterCard, AmericanExpress etc..)

For cryptocurrency payment gateway I added Coinbase Commerce, so every payment is made securely via Coinbase.com.

Accepted cryptocurrencies are: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin.

So..I'm trying to build long-term brand, a trusted website with community around.

Why We Are Here,"I've lurked here for a very long time, but only recently have I felt compelled to post anything. I must remind everyone why we are here. 

We are here for the impoverished ""third-world,"" we are here to stand up to corrupt and reckless politicians and bureaucrats, we are here to stand up to the predatory credit industry who've enslaved or killed millions of people through debt all around the world. We are here as a solution to so many wrongs in our world and we need to lock arms in solidarity to accomplish these monumental challenges, not quibble over capital gains or which coin is better. We are here to do what those in power have no desire to do: help people, especially the poor. Never forget why we are here. If Wall Street wants to make a quick buck off us, fine, but don’t believe for a second that you are one of them. The disparity in wealth between the rich and poor has never been greater, and millions are crushed by the exploitative, corrupt, and criminal financial industry. This is how we put people back at the center of finance and provide a system that ensures that no one can take your money. 

Being a part of that is worth my optimism and my money, even if it were to fail. We control the success or failure of this endeavor, so be optimistic, be enthusiastic, but most importantly be an advocate. If we collectively do these things correctly, the price has no choice but to go up. So, focus on doing these things and forget about the price, which eventually won’t matter. The true gain is found in the abstract.",1534722679,19/08/2018 23:51:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98os5c/why_we_are_here/,1

Question from first-time bitcoin buyer!,"Hey all, I’m looking to get into some very light online gambling, and am looking to avoid putting my bank account online. One method the website accepts is bitcoin, and this method has the fewest fees associated with it. 

I have the basics down, like buying bitcoin from Coinbase and transferring them to a blockchain wallet before depositing it online. My question is this; can I buy bitcoin using a prepaid visa or MasterCard such as NetSpend? That way I don’t need to involve my bank. Or is PayPal the best way to do it? And are there excessive PayPal fees for buying bitcoin this way?

And lastly, as someone who knows basically nothing about bitcoin, is the value pretty steady lately? Or does it still fluctuate? I’m just wondering about the risk of my investment going down in the long run.

[Beginner's summary] What is Bitcoin Cash?,"At its inception, Bitcoin was an ingenious piece of software, a decentralized online payment system that would allow different parties to send money to each other without going through financial institutions. Some hardcore Bitcoin fans believed it would one day replace payment services and become the main way we pay for goods and services every day.

But as Bitcoin became increasingly popular and more and more people started using the cryptocurrency to transfer money and to support payments in online applications, it ran into problems that its creator(s) had not predicted. Most prominent among these problems was slow payments and high transaction fees.

Bitcoin developers were divided over how to solve the problem, and a lack of consensus in the community led to hard forks, a process in which an alternate version of Bitcoin is created. The most popular fork is Bitcoin Cash, which addresses the problems of Bitcoin by raising the block size to support more transactions per hour.

But not everyone is convinced that an upgrade to the block size is the solution to Bitcoin’s problems.

Localbitcoins Support - Biased or Incapable,"Long story short, I sent funds to the bank details provided by SELLER to the details he provided on LBC. He claims that he didn't receive funds. LBC asked him for evidences. Dispute started on 24th July, 2018 and today is 28th day of dispute. In these 28 days, I have provided 54 evidences of payment obtained from online banking, bank branch, customer services, receiver's bank in the form of documents, audios, videos and pictures. In these 28 days, SELLER made 1 upload which was rejected by LBC. LBC particularly needed one document from him which he was asked on 8 different occasions during these 28 days and each time he failed. 

4 days ago, he was given 24 hours to provide same document, SELLER decided to simply ignore the request and not respond, even he is online every hour. When deadline finished, I protested. Admin didn't answer for another 24 hours. Finally, admin responded and asked him again for document giving him 16 hours more. 

If someone from senior management of LBC cannot respond and tell me:

1. Is this delay is because someone is biased there?
2. Or is an incapable man is handling my dispute?

Why he has been given 8 different chances? Worst, why he was given another 16 hours even he stayed silent for 72 hours and still silent when he was given 24 hours before?

I have attached admin's messages addressing SELLER to provide that document. I have covered username, and financial information to make sure I am not in violation of any terms of services.

If LBC is watching this, the dispute number is 25406498.

The Way Money Used to Be,"https://cryptomurmur.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The-way-money-used-to-be-1.png

I wrote this story about the paradigm shift that cryptocurrencies may cause in the future, from the perspective of an old man reflecting on the past.

If you enjoy this story, please have a look at other material I have written at https://cryptomurmur.com/

The Way Money Used to Be

“I remember it like it was yesterday, James,” the old man wistfully pondered. “Money was so different back then. Everything was different.”

“How so, Will?” the younger one asked - not so young as to be a child, but young enough to not remember the way money used to be.

“Back then,” Will replied, “money was not something shared and traded freely like it is now… it was mostly owned by a few, and they were the few who controlled it. They issued it, and they manipulated its value to their advantage.”

“They could print it, as much as they would convince the people they needed, and over time, the money became worth less and less, but the people would owe more and more.”

“But if they mined it and mined it,” James asked, “and mined it all, wouldn’t they run out of money eventually? Then the money would be scarce and become worth more, right?”

“No, no, no!” Will was amused at James’ naivete. “They didn’t mine it like we do now. Now, our computers solve mathematical problems to mine a currency, and it becomes more and more scarce, and more and more valuable, but back then, the people in power just printed more and more money as they saw fit, creating more and more debt and less and less value.”

“Out of thin air?” James was incredulous. “How could they do that? Didn’t people see how they were taking advantage of them?”

“It took time for people to realise. They began to realise when the new money came to be. But it was a slow, gradual change. Cryptocurrency did not have a good reputation, at first.”

James was confused. “What do you mean? How can a currency be bad? Can’t it be used for good or bad?”

“Of course!” Will replied, “but the few who controlled money wanted to keep things that way, so they created fear and paranoia about the new money. They said cryptocurrency was only used by criminals, paying for committing horrible acts with impunity, behind a shield of anonymity. The old money, on the other hand, was tracked and followed everywhere it went on the Internet, thus creating the illusion of safety. In reality, though, it was controlled and manipulated.”

“And people didn’t mind? They just willingly gave up their privacy like that? Bizarre!” James was struggling to relate to such a different way of seeing the world.

“They didn’t know there were better alternatives” Will explained. “Money was not only controlled by the few, the powerful, and the elite, but also by tanks, guns and bombs. There wasn’t much the average person could do about it at the time.”

“Money was centralised - controlled by a few powerful entities. Not like now. Cryptocurrency as we know it today has no central authority. It can not be attacked and destroyed at any one single point,” Will continued, “It wasn’t secure like it is now, either. Money could be stolen and hidden in vast quantities by those in power who could control what was seen, so nobody could possibly know if a government or other person in power was stealing money from the rest of the people.”

James was astonished. “No public ledger? So, you just had to trust the people who controlled the money to be honest about the money, when it was in their best interests to be selfish? That makes no sense!”

Will laughed. “I know, it’s funny when you think back how it just seemed perfectly normal and acceptable at the time! Now it seems… ridiculous!”

They chuckled as they reminisced.

“I remember…” Will continued, “You would have to go to a place called a bank - a place that might give you permission to store your own money there if you had enough money to begin with, and then charged you for storing it, charged you for withdrawing it, charged you for sending it, and profited from gambling it, all while charging you more to borrow it!”

“That’s crazy.” James almost sounded disgusted. “You didn’t just store your own money in your own wallet? And just send it to whomever you please?”

“Nope!” Will replied. “Instead, you asked the bank to send it for you, for a fee, of course! And if you wanted to send money to family or friends across the world, well…”

“Well, what?” James prodded.

“Well… it could take days, and it cost a great deal.”

James answered, “Well I suppose that’s fair since that was before the internet, right? I mean, it wouldn’t be so easy to move money like that back then, right?”

“Oh, no, no.” Will clarified. “The internet had already been around for quite some time, in fact. But because currencies were not cryptocurrencies, because they were centrally controlled with middlemen like banks, there was not much choice but to pay for the banks to move the money as they saw fit. And if they could make more money charging fees to send money around the world, why wouldn’t they?” Will chuckled.

“Wow” James found the whole scenario amusing.

“It’s funny how when you look back at something in the past, it can seem so ridiculous, but at the time, it seems perfectly reasonable” Will contemplated.

“I know I’ll never understand it!” they laughed together, one at memories of the strange ways things were in the past, the other not quite understanding how different things had become.

So what exactly is cryptocurrency then?

Cryptocurrency attempts to solve many of the problems of the modern money system, called fiat. In the current money system, money is printed or minted by selling debt. The money is then lent out to borrowers and spent around the world. More and more money gets printed and more and more debt gets created. Since the money is created out of debt, it is impossible to ever pay back the debt entirely as more debt is constantly created with the money that is used to continuously pay the debt.

Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is not printed or minted out of debt. It is created, most commonly, through a process that uses computer work, solving math problems that can not be cheated. It is created by anyone who chooses to participate in its creation, called a miner, much like miners of gold and other precious metals. When a miner successfully “mines” a cryptocurrency by solving a math problem with a computer, they are rewarded with a “block”, and can choose to keep the reward or to trade it with others. So, it is not controlled or stored somewhere by any one person or government. This is the greatest unique attribute of cryptocurrency - that it is decentralised - not controlled or stored by any one “central” person or group of people.

Cryptocurrencies use computer code that makes it secure and prevents it from being copied, so it can not be created out of debt and can not become so plentiful as to be worthless. Whenever someone trades cryptocurrency with someone else, the transactions also use this computer code, called cryptography, to make sure the transaction is true and that it is secure.

Miners are a part of this process, making sure that every transaction is correct and is not a duplicate or an incorrect amount. Most cryptocurrencies record these trades in a chain of blocks, called the blockchain, with each block storing information about the trade. The blocks create a chain of information that is checked by miners to make sure it is true. So cryptocurrency, through the use of cryptography, is far more secure than old fashioned fiat money.

Another great advantage of cryptocurrency is that it is much cheaper to send to people anywhere. Since there is no need for any kind of bank or money transfer agent, the fees can be tiny, rewarding miners around the world for checking that each trade is correct on a public ledger; the permanent and unchangeable list of trades seen on the blockchain. The public ledger is like an open account book where everyone can see all of the trades. Anyone who wants can look and see the amounts of currency that have been traded. Cryptocurrencies can use features that makes these transactions anonymous to varying degrees, to protect the privacy of traders. Money can be sent anywhere in the world without any border issues or bank accounts, directly from one person to another using this cryptographic system. The fee to send cryptocurrency to the other side of the world would be the same as it would be to send it to your neighbour because of this system.

Often, because of a cryptocurrency’s ability to send money anonymously anywhere in the world, it is portrayed as being used mostly by criminals for various crimes and terrorism. In reality, fiat money is used for almost all criminal activity in the form of cash, mostly USD. Ultimately, any currency can be used for good or evil, but it is in the interests of central fiat powers, who make a great deal of profit from debt, fees, and fiat money fabrication, to maintain a negative image for cryptocurrency.

Of all cryptocurrencies, the best known by far is Bitcoin. It is the oldest blockchain with the most miners and is seen as the most trusted and secure for this reason. But there are many other cryptocurrencies with different purposes. Ethereum, for example, is a cryptocurrency that was created with the idea of using the currency itself as a sort of platform for programming. Many cryptocurrencies are traded for goods and services on a constant basis, like Litecoin, Monero, and Ripple. There are literally thousands of cryptocurrencies for different purposes!

If you’re interested in cryptocurrencies, you can learn to mine them on your own computer or you can simply buy them from exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. There are new exchanges constantly springing up around the world, so check out exchanges in your region.",1534734648,20/08/2018 03:10:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98q4lk/the_way_money_used_to_be/,1

Scaling?,"Why do people hate the idea of bigger blocks so much? Combined with Segwit, 4-10mb blocks would be an easy way to scale ""short term"" and allow the LN to fully mature before forcing people onto it. 

Even if everyone starts using LN, there will still be a need for onchain transactions, and 1mb simply won't be enough to support that need.

Is this wrong? I'm really not a fan of how Bcash is trying to solve scaling, blocksize should stay 'reasonable' but a slight increase wouldn't hurt anyone. ",1534746542,20/08/2018 06:29:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98r99a/scaling/,1

Bitcoin is an investment now and a currency later,"Many people claim that bitcoin is not a true currency because of little acceptance by merchants and high volatility.

This is true. I believe that right now bitcoin is not a currency but rather an invest similar to eg buying shares. Shares such as eg in Apple or Amazon are volatile, but you buy it with the hope that it will be worth more later.

That is how it is with bitcoin today. You buy it because you believe it will be worth more later.

When you buy shares in small companies (small caps) you can expect high volatility. Eg a startup will have volatile prices as we don't know whether the company will do well. However, once a small company becomes a large company then volatility reduces significantly. Similarly once bitcoin is used more and more, volatility will go down. This is when it will become a currency. ",1534761455,20/08/2018 10:37:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98shu8/bitcoin_is_an_investment_now_and_a_currency_later/,1

Few Advantages of having bitcoin:," Bitcoin is the only payment method that is 100% irreversible and cannot be charged back. For this reason you should be careful when sending Bitcoins; be sure that you are sending them to a trusted vendor.

Anyone, from any country, of any age can accept Bitcoins within minutes. There is no ID card, passport or proof of address that all conventional banks required to open an account. All you need to do to start sending and receiving Bitcoins is to download a Bitcoin Wallet program and generate a Bitcoin Address.

When making a Bitcoin transfer the fees are extremely low compared to conventional methods of moving money.",1534763643,20/08/2018 11:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98sp0w/few_advantages_of_having_bitcoin/,1

Returning the Favor,"When [I was a child](https://media1.tenor.com/images/681094dcf9ee1efc961bb6dc268f4981/tenor.gif?itemid=4563650), many decades ago, my parents opened for me a joint checking and savings account through an amazing [institution](https://media0.giphy.com/media/iQg1Rag8fnIS4/giphy.gif) that to this day still honors dividend payments on deposits in my savings AND checking accounts. No minimum required. 

It is truly one of the few [decent](https://media1.tenor.com/images/d216d92c8018f50155c612fa053457ea/tenor.gif?itemid=8992096) traditional institutions, and I am grateful to my parents for having done so.

As I noted, decades have past, as has [my father](https://i.imgur.com/EfJyh1F.png), and I've been trying to think of ways that I can help my mother and siblings understand Bitcoin on a rudimentary level, without them thinking I'm talking about [magic internet money](https://media.giphy.com/media/YIkeOlJSxxsv6/giphy.gif), and without them immediately imagining I'm wearing a tinfoil hat. Attempts to this point have been fruitless, and my portrait in their minds is surely no different than that of Alex Jones.

Regardless, I finally thought of a way, and it really was simple. I grabbed each of them (my mother and each sibling) and asked them for a bit of time, about 15 minutes.

I told them they didn't need to understand Bitcoin. They [didn't have to believe in Bitcoin](https://i.imgur.com/YxhCJAR.jpg). They didn't have to use Bitcoin. . . but they need to have access to storing it, much like I needed to have access to a Checking and Saving accounts back when I was only 5 years old. There was no purpose to me having those accounts, other than to establish them, and help me conceptually grasp that they were there, and that is where money went.

So during this 15 minutes, I sat down with my computer and my Trezor, along with the Trezor I bought for each of them, and set up their Trezor. At the end of it all, I sent them each [about 0.01 BTC.](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xHi4t2UsuIY9QA/giphy.gif)

I told them about the security built into such a device, how only human error is really going to lead to problems with the security, and I told them to keep it safe. I told them about the general concept of privacy that Bitcoin offers. I explained to them the basic concept of [FUD](https://media1.tenor.com/images/28953eb0da0e6dcbaa270a491c2881d2/tenor.gif?itemid=4712571), specifically about Bitcoin being ""Hacked"" or ""Dead"", and how those prognostications have been wrong, and how Bitcoin has never been hacked, but that exchanges had. I explained the risks associated with exchanges, but how they can be a useful on-ramp if they want to convert more USD to BTC. 

Funny enough, I only even brought up the concept of exchanges because each and every one of them, at some point in the setup, asked a question along the lines of ""Well, what do I do [if I want to get more](https://media1.tenor.com/images/afb21a0762dadc914f598ef913ea1128/tenor.gif?itemid=4247290) Bitcoin?""

It was a lot of money to spend only to store 0.1 BTC each, and maybe those wallets will never be used. Maybe they'll be tossed. Maybe they'll be forgotten because those conversations will be relegated to a memory of a [crazy brother](https://media.giphy.com/media/svb8tKSIpGfHq/giphy.gif), or a nerdy son.

I don't know. 

I do know that I value my Checking and Saving accounts with the institution I do business with. I know that had no one taken the time to help me with that, I might have gotten sucked into a [crappy company](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XD314_3nCCq_OR_20180123193134.jpg?width=620&amp;height=413), or maybe I wouldn't have learned about banking until much later in life. Who knows. . . but I value that, and I wanted to return the favor.

I'm probably going to wait a while, but whether it is 6 months or 6 years from now, I hope I get the call from one of them. ""/u/foxyjim99, thank you. This has really paid dividends."" ",1534773968,20/08/2018 14:06:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98tut2/returning_the_favor/,1
payments,"paypal (and like services)  
In this category is paypal, western union, venmo and a host of other money transmitting services. I transfered $200 last week via western union. After fees and taxes, it cost me $12.54 to move that money. You could also do it with paypal, however paypal has dispute resolution. That is to say if I sell you a laptop, and you claim the laptop arrived broken, then paypal will reverse the situation (even if your lying about the laptop arriving broken) As a seller, I simply cannot accept paypal due to scammers utilizing it to chargeback my business into oblivion.

checks  
In theory checks are great. In practice... not so much. All it takes to empty a million dollars from my bank account is for me to write a check. Then, you take that check and wash it. I write in millions of dollars while I know you are on vacation, or out of town, or super busy and don't have time to look at your bank account online. Then I transfer it to my account, and a loyal band of thieves cashes it out. My account is in the name of a stolen identity, and suddenly its an international game of cat and mouse until I can flee the country to some other country that has no extradition to the united states. Like russia. Checks are fundamentally insecure, and any checking account linked to them should not have any more money in than is required to fulfill the checks.

bank wires  
Bank wires are perfect. Gold standard. Secure, moves money in 30 minutes, and it costs an arm and a leg. $30. .\_. But aside from that $30 charge, if I intend to move a million dollars, life is good. 

ach  
These are safe but SLOW. Reaaaaally slow. They take a whole week with money not visible while in transit. 

Credit cards  
See paypal's chargeback issues. Scammers steal people's credit cards, use them in my store, and I am liable to reimburse the credit card companies for these fraudulent purchases. Ick. Also, if I am doing low volume, they cost a lot. 

Cash.   
Good old cash. Secure, free to use, and best of all no chargeback! However carrying over a thousand dollars in cash risks cops seizing it as ""drug money"" and thieves stealing it to be used as drug money, and it can only be used in person. 

Now into all of this steps bitcoin.   
 It's not volatile over the time durations I need to use it for as a merchant. Yes it goes up and down (ALOT) but its volatility on any given 15 minute interval does not exceed .5% which is far less than what credit cards charge. Its fees are also low right now. I just did a btc transaction and calced fee, it was less than 2 cents. The trick is to cash the bitcoin into dollars at coinbase as soon as you get it. It's a safe haven and scammers can't chargeback and ruin my profits. As a buyer, I am glad that I can use it to buy things that my local bank doesn't approve of (like prostitutes). 

And then I come across you guys like the folks on /rbuttcoin that like to mock cryptocurrencies. I really have to ask...  
Are the guys from /rbuttcoin russian credit card hackers hiding in latvia scared that bitcoin will ruin their criminal enterprise?",1534774034,20/08/2018 14:07:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98tv5w/payments/,1

At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.

I  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK

Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)

When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.

I emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO &amp; Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue. 

Police official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)

National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.

After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)

I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.

Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.

Reason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.

Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at €10.000 to  €15.000 for civil proceedings,

One of the lawyers stated that i should also be also eligible for  BTC + BCH  as per blogpost - [HERE](https://localbitcoins.com/blog/bitcoin-bcash)

Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court

The direction of choice is driven by events, and the current is dominated by shocks.

The mid-term bottom temporarily maintains around 5280, and does not rule out a wave of more than 6600 directions.

Ethics in Journalism and The Harm Limitation Principle,"How many journalists fail to do #1 on the list below?

[https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp)

Seek Truth and Report It

Ethical journalism should be accurate and fair. Journalists should be honest and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information.

Journalists should:

1. Take responsibility for the accuracy of their work. Verify information before releasing it. Use original sources whenever possible.
2. Remember that neither speed nor format excuses inaccuracy.
3. Provide context. Take special care not to misrepresent or oversimplify in promoting, previewing or summarizing a story.
4. Gather, update and correct information throughout the life of a news story.
5. Be cautious when making promises, but keep the promises they make.
6. Identify sources clearly. The public is entitled to as much information as possible to judge the reliability and motivations of sources.
7. Consider sources’ motives before promising anonymity. Reserve anonymity for sources who may face danger, retribution or other harm, and have information that cannot be obtained elsewhere. Explain why anonymity was granted.
8. Diligently seek subjects of news coverage to allow them to respond to criticism or allegations of wrongdoing.
9. Avoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information unless traditional, open methods will not yield information vital to the public.
10. Be vigilant and courageous about holding those with power accountable. Give voice to the voiceless.
11. Support the open and civil exchange of views, even views they find repugnant.
12. Recognize a special obligation to serve as watchdogs over public affairs and government. Seek to ensure that the public’s business is conducted in the open, and that public records are open to all.
13. Provide access to source material when it is relevant and appropriate.
14. Boldly tell the story of the diversity and magnitude of the human experience. Seek sources whose voices we seldom hear.
15. Avoid stereotyping. Journalists should examine the ways their values and experiences may shape their reporting.
16. Label advocacy and commentary.
17. Never deliberately distort facts or context, including visual information. Clearly label illustrations and re-enactments.
18. Never plagiarize. Always attribute.

Minimize Harm

Ethical journalism treats sources, subjects, colleagues and members of the public as human beings deserving of respect.

Journalists should:

1. Balance the public’s need for information against potential harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness.
2. Show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage. Use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles, victims of sex crimes, and sources or subjects who are inexperienced or unable to give consent. Consider cultural differences in approach and treatment.
3. Recognize that legal access to information differs from an ethical justification to publish or broadcast.
4. Realize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than public figures and others who seek power, influence or attention. Weigh the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information.
5. Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity, even if others do.
6. Balance a suspect’s right to a fair trial with the public’s right to know. Consider the implications of identifying criminal suspects before they face legal charges.
7. Consider the long-term implications of the extended reach and permanence of publication. Provide updated and more complete information as appropriate.",1534782289,20/08/2018 16:24:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98v1rw/ethics_in_journalism_and_the_harm_limitation/,1

"Bloomberg's latest article uses the misleading name ""Bitcoin Cash"", let's ask them to use ""BCash"" instead","Bloomberg's latest article [‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Is Having a Hard Time Winning Over True Believers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-20/-bitcoin-jesus-having-a-hard-time-winning-over-true-believers) is damning for BCash. It shows data that, much like any other altcoin, bcash is barely used for any transactions.

Sadly, the article calls it ""Bitcoin Cash"" throughout.

BCash was not the first altcoin, and won't be the last. But it's the first altcoin to name itself confusingly close to Bitcoin. When bcash was created, all bitcoin holders also found themselves also owning bcash, this is known as an ""airdrop"". The first airdrop ever was the altcoin Clams from 2014, many other altcoins also used this airdrop method.

There's many reports of newbs accidentally buying bcash instead of bitcoin. This happens because people go along with the confusingly-similar name. Roger Ver's website bitcoin(dot)com is also filled with promotional material saying that bcash is ""The Real Bitcoin"".

Someone from [twitter reports](https://twitter.com/rdouvy/status/1030603439238086658): **no joke - friend of mine with no crypto knowledge tried to buy $500 worth of #Bitcoin. unknowingly used the http://Bitcoin.com  app, and accidentally bought #Bcash instead. @rogerkver is a scammer and his crooked marketing tactics are impacting innocent people**.

Bloomberg and indeed all journalists have a responsibility to help stop people falling for fraud and con tricks. By calling the altcoin ""Bitcoin Cash"" they only help the fraudsters trick innocent newbs.

I've sent a message to Bloomberg asking them to not use the ""Bitcoin Cash"" name so they inadvertently don't help fraudsters.",1534790254,20/08/2018 18:37:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98w7h7/bloombergs_latest_article_uses_the_misleading/,1

Unauthorized Coinbase transaction followed by flurry of spam emails.,"So I just witnessed a crypto spam email attack. Its very scary. 

To begin with, there was an unauthorized transaction in Coinbase for $3200.00 

I didn’t access my account for the last couple of days and I saw an email with the subject “Your purchase for $3,200.00 USD of BTC has started”. I never made this transaction. 

One strange thing I noticed after that was I saw a flurry of spam emails coming in my mailbox. I had no clue whats happening. 

So the first thing I did was lock down my Coinbase account. The support staff was very quick in doing that. 

The flurry of spam email makes sense because if someone has made that transaction they definitely want you to skip the email from Coinbase. You may endup deleting all the emails in one go and miss that there has been an activity in your CB account. This is really very scary.

"A listed advantage of crypto over fiat is transaction time, what if fiat has faster transaction times?","I think maybe this advantage is just unique to the US? 

In my country (NZ), if you transfer money within the same bank (eg I’m with Bank A, I send my friend money who is also with Bank A), then it’s an instant transaction. If I transfer money to my friend who is with Bank B, it’s in their account in a couple of hours or the next business day - neither of these transactions incur fees. From what I’ve read, this isn’t the case in other countries.

How do you think crypto would be affected if every countries banking systems were like NZ’s?",1534829600,21/08/2018 05:33:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/990im5/a_listed_advantage_of_crypto_over_fiat_is/,1

How will bitcoin change my life?,"Hello, I am Mom.  Raising twin boys aren’t always easy but giving up on the struggle isn’t an option. I’m a single parent and have financially and emotionally supporting us on my own.  I want to be an example that moms can do this on their own. I don’t want us to be part of the ridiculous statistic that kids benefit and are raising better in a two parent household. Not true!
One of my twins has special needs, he’s considered high functioning autism but I consider him a complete introvert. He has so many challenges but I refuse to believe and always imagine that the doctors, teachers and everyone else is wrong about him and he is going to prove that indeed, they are wrong. 
My dream is to get both my kids into better place....   I have been a reader of crypto news for many months. Crypto currencies can solve our problem. So we need financial help…. kindly donate (Bitcoin)…. BTC wallet address:  3KrBqiSvjjapiheHqDdi34EhsvfM5473gM

Coinsocialstory for Bitcoin,"Hey, Bitcoin community!

I'm the independent developer working on the analytical project called Coinsocialstory. Here I rate 54 cryptocurrencies and tokens via indexes I invented, such as social, development, network and price, of course. And Bitcoin os one of them 😎 First of them, to be technically.

Couple of month ago asking here about the community's opinion, I've gained a lot of feedback and advices. And the most of these advices happened to be very useful, expecially the development part. So I've changed my graphs a bit so now they show the indexes value for the whole quarter and for each day separately. Also, I added the brief information about Bitcoin and a link to its whitepaper on the personal BTC page on my project. 

This is how the price graphs part looks like right now:

"Low-cost travel, avoiding holiday traffic congestion, see how the blockchain is working","The Yunnan Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce introduced blockchain technology to comprehensively rectify the tourism market, and the development of “tourism + blockchain” has taken another step. At the same time, the ""tourism + blockchain"" integration application - blockchain tourism platform, relying on the blockchain technology, is focusing on the two major tourism problems of high-cost travel and holiday tourism congestion.

During this year's Dragon Boat Festival holiday, the Yunnan Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce introduced blockchain technology to comprehensively rectify the tourism market. Through online trading supervision platform, cluster analysis of tourism shopping, travel agencies, scenic spots, airlines and other websites has been effective. Under the effect of blockchain technology, this year's Yunnan Dragon Boat Festival tourism market is running smoothly and orderly.

The practice of Yunnan Tourism Bureau can be said to be the initial attempt of blockchain technology in tourism public management. The combination of blockchain technology and big data, the role of blockchain + Internet of Things can be solved during various small holidays. Management departments or consumers often encounter high travel costs, merchants, traffic jams, and overcrowding in major scenic spots.

Some people say that blockchain + Internet of Things = wireless capabilities, which are reflected in data applications, resource interaction sharing, consumption upgrades and spending reductions. The blockchain can provide a big data management solution for the Internet of Things. If applied to traffic, predict traffic travel conditions, and generate holiday travel guides through big data fusion, which will avoid holiday congestion.

https://i.redd.it/q590ovyhffh11.jpg

Big data mainly manages massive data, and the core of the blockchain is decentralized. There is no third-party intermediary, and the high security and high reliability of data are realized on the basis of reducing the cost of service providers.

Take LEOOY as an example, it will make all the information of the service provider participants transparent, let the consumers know the situation of the service provider well, and the service provider will reduce the cost after reducing the commission of the third-party intermediary, and will not try again. The approach is to undermine costs and impose them on consumers through a variety of appropriate or inappropriate marketing methods.

In the same way, if the scenic spot also participates in the blockchain platform as a participant, then the sales situation of the scenic spot will be made public, and the consumers can re-plan the route according to the number of people, and the scenic spot will not be oversold.

Therefore, the blockchain travel platform is not tamperable and traceable based on data. All transactions, reviews, ratings, and rating data are non-destructible and permanently recorded in different blocks, and are peer-to-peer transactions. The settlement method, the platform does not charge any commission, it will prompt all service providers to focus on the quality of service, so that travelers can enjoy a better travel experience at a more favorable price.

Blockchain technology can be said to be a long way to go for the tourism industry. Today, there are Tripio, excellent travel chains, etc., which are based on accommodation or a single sector. There are also LEOOY services covering hotel reservations. Enterprises with complete industry chains such as ticket booking, scenic spot inquiry, resource sharing and social sharing are constantly improving and developing. It is believed that with the combination of blockchain and tourism scenes, a new platform for future tourism that is fair, fair and transparent will be created. The tourism industry is ushered in a new round of peaks.",1534852488,21/08/2018 11:54:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/992jqt/lowcost_travel_avoiding_holiday_traffic/,1

Here you have some tips what to consider before investing.,"1. Choose the platform you want to use.

There are many different P2P lending platforms. All of them use cryptocollateral to protect your investment. They differ only by fee rates and terms. Just compare several to find out what platform offers the best option.

2. Think about the investment duration.

Longer investments bring long-term profits while short investments allow you to reinvest under different conditions. We think that the better option will be a golden mean between both.

3. Diversify your investments

Instead of investing one big amount ant a single rate. This can work out but will lower the chances to get higher benefits. Split this amount into several smaller ones, and make investments with higher interest rates at random time.

4. Remember your past investments.

Make an analysis of your past investments, point out the good and bad sides of each investment; it will help you to make patterns of the fulfillment of each deal. These patterns can be applied to your further investments that will bring you higher profit accordingly.

5. Do a double-check of the platform you want to invest your money with.

Make sure this platform is a reputable and reliable one and it guarantees the security of your investments. Considering all the mentioned above, you can forget the Golden Rule ‘Invest amount you can afford to lose’ and invest amounts that will bring you the highest profit.

  [LendaBit.com](https://LendaBit.com) is the trustworthy professional in P2P lending.

This will probably get downvoted into obvilion... But can someone please explain to me.....,"How exactly, is bitcoin ""digital gold""? Bear with me please, but I've been flipping through ""the bitcoin standard"" and I have questions.

So, 1's and 0's as gold is a wonderful meme. But it seems that this community believes Bitcoin was created by the non-human(s)?

When look at bitcoin, I see that its software, and thus a design by men. As such, I assume that when a user looks to download Bitcoin software, they choose a committee from which to do so. Further, it seems that all the committees are either forked bitcoin's from a head committee, (or is itself the head committee). That would suggest that Bitcoin a product of men, and their consensus.

Gold is designed by nature. And we know this, because gold doesn't have a version number. So... what gives exactly? What is Gold about bitcoin exactly. Is it that it's scarce? But why does that make it digital gold, and not digital lead? (or more likely, just... not at all analogous to gold)",1534859668,21/08/2018 13:54:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/993btz/this_will_probably_get_downvoted_into_obvilion/,1
crypto Currency Trading vs Traditional Trading - Bitcoin and Gold," Currency crypto is the next step in financial evolution. Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency based on a system that operates without any central bank or intermediary, the BTC has made a real breakthrough in trading and asset allocation. So online currency trading has expanded its asset base... but will it eventually replace traditional investment?  


**Should we flee Gold for Bitcoin?**  
People love gold. It's a safe haven value. That is why a large part of the investments are invested in this precious metal. But the time of the gold rush is over; gold and bullion buyers should not treat it as an asset for rapid enrichment. On the other hand, it remains an attractive long-term investment.  


Traces of ancient gold mines and mining operations dating back to 200,000 BC have been found. Civilizations began trading gold around 600 BC, and it is still used by traders and investors with great enthusiasm today. Investing in gold also has the advantage of holding a product with intrinsic value, both as a precious metal but also as a metal used in the manufacture of many products (especially electronics). In addition, it should be stressed that the price of gold is much less volatile than that of other assets, including Bitcoin which lacks stability - just look at a graph of the BTC USD price to see.  


One can quite envisage a rebound in the price of gold. The US dollar is negatively correlated to gold, therefore any weakness in the US currency should have a positive impact on the young metal price. The cost of mining gold in mines is likely to increase significantly, leading to the bankruptcy of some mines and thus reducing gold supply. If this happens, prices will rise as gold reserves run out.  


Gold represents about 1-2% of financial transactions. An increase in gold demand should lead to price peaks. In addition, any increase in the inflation rate could lead to an increase in the price of gold. Moreover, the debt-to-GDP ratio in developed countries has been steadily increasing in recent years, reflecting an increase in the amount of money in circulation, which is positive for precious metals, such as gold, as it leads to a decline in the value of the counterpart currency.  


The quantity of Bitcoin units in circulation is limited, which induces a specific difference compared to other investments. For the first time we have an asset that is not fully controlled by a third party entity, such as a government or a central bank. However, Bitcoin is unlikely to replace gold as an investment asset because the system set up by Bitcoin is still far from the common markets in terms of number and volume of daily transactions. Only once Bitcoin has reached this scale of development can it legitimately claim the status of ""universal"" currency and be used as a legitimate form of currency.  


**A Bitcoin trading strategy**  
We are currently witnessing irrational behaviour in the crypto currency market. People think it's the future, but they remind me a lot of the internet bubble... and it could burst with major damage.  


Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptographic currency. People invest money in it thinking it will never be devalued because there is no central bank to regulate it. At some point it will necessarily have to be controlled by one or more entities, because people buy Bitcoin to pay for trades/services, and it is difficult to pay with too small fractions of units. If a Bitcoin is worth, for example, 14,400 USD, and a plumber charges you 100 USD for his services, in Bitcoin terms that would mean you need to pay him with a fraction of a coin (a unit of Bitcoin). Thus, this system becomes ridiculous from the moment the value of a Bitcoin unit becomes too important. It will therefore be necessary:  


*-Create additional Bitcoin units;*  
*-Change the price if it becomes too important;*  
*-Find a viable alternative if it is not possible to pay in very small fractions of Bitcoin.*  


One more thing to emphasize is that if we score higher again in 2018-2019 on the equity markets, the 2018 Bitcoin could collapse with the equity and real estate markets. Usually, all risky assets explode together, and we could see a destruction of value. When loans are repaid, it actually reduces the money supply by the same amount as the repayment, while assets devalue while currencies strengthen in this kind of environment.  


**Buy Bitcoin Futures**  
The adoption of future Bitcoin should be considered as a major step in the evolution of Bitcoin 2018. Banks tend to denounce Bitcoin because it is an investment made on an unregulated market, which they consider to be a'risky' investment; they denounce it because such investments in Bitcoin would constitute a flight within the capital usually allocated to the traditional banking services they offer to individuals. The passage through a regulated market makes it easier and cheaper to transfer funds between individuals and/or traders via Bitcoin technology. The introduction of future BTCs is a first step in the space of regulated markets, which constitutes a lower risk for investors wishing to buy Bitcoin.  


Basically, when you consider what Bitcoin offers to society, in the sense that it constitutes a store of value (especially for countries with highly devalued currencies or in hyperinflation) and a Bitcoin buying platform (of transactions), it is not excluded that the price could reach USD 70,000 per Bitcoin, which would bring it to a market capitalization level of USD 1,000 billion, which would still represent a fraction of the gold market, which is valued at USD 7,000 billion. It should however be noted that Bitcoin is much easier to use for transactions, unlike gold which is only a safe haven.  


In addition, several elements of the technical analysis show that it could reach USD 70,000 per Bitcoin, as crazy as that may seem. The use of futures contracts via Bitcoin futures should provide more liquidity to the Bitcoin market, making it less volatile.  


**Bitcoin investments: other risks**  
It is not excluded that governments may unleash pressure against Bitcoin. Indeed, this crypto-money competes with the national currency of states, and thus mechanically renders monetary policies ineffective.  


In addition, banks have large portfolios and may decide to buy Bitcoin to protect their retail banking revenues, which are threatened by Bitcoin technology.  


For conspiracy theorists, it is likely that banks and governments will decide on hacker employees to hack into Bitcoin technology. This would create a security gap, which would lead to a loss of investor confidence and a massive repatriation of capital to the more traditional assets offered by banks.  


As central banks print more and more money over time, thus devaluing the value of fiduciary currencies, current QE (Quantitative Easing) policies could then be considered very risky, since inflating central banks' balance sheets. As central banks embark on such decisions, they demonstrate no desire to safeguard the long-term value of their respective currencies in a currency war environment.  


The key factor with the announcement of the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) is that now large investors can hedge their exposure, so they no longer have any reason to avoid investing in Bitcoin. The next few days will help determine institutional interest in this market. If they can cover themselves, they'll get into position. Remember the internet bubble? Conservative funds were forced to invest in high-tech stocks and deemed risky because their performance appeared poor compared to high-tech funds. The same thing can happen to crypto currencies. When the first funds get double-digit returns by placing some of their funds in crypto, everyone will want to imitate them and follow suit.

The latest news which influenced the price of Bitcoin.,"**Nasdaq and Gemini plan a crypto-trading platform**  
&amp;nbsp;  

Nasdaq is aiming to become the first stock exchange participating the cryptocurrency trading. According to rumours, the Winklevoss brothers are going to help. On August, 16, [ICO Journal](http://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT05NjI5MDA5MzI1MDc0NzMyNTQmYz1rNGo4JmU9MTkyOCZiPTE5NjYzMzMyOCZkPW42aTB3OWk=.Kkj0ucl0yxZYPCs7EI0vsCMyeaY5MYB4dq11S8xw-P8) reported that Nasdaq and Gemini would unite to launch a cryptocurrency trading on the stock exchange platform. The source said:  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
*“Tyler and Cameron have moved the ball down the field in a meaningful way. Nasdaq, and its leadership, already are predisposed to finding an architecture solution and being the first to list actual tokens. Not just ETF’s or futures or some ‘derivative’ of the crypto apparatus […] but rather list actual coins. They are getting very comfortable with the structures they’ve seen from Gemini, and the other research they’ve done with exchanges of note. There is a timeline forming for this decision and it could be earlier than some might think.”*  
&amp;nbsp;  

Nasdaq is one of the first large exchanges that have become interested in cryptocurrency derivatives, such as [Exchange Traded Notes (ETN’s)]
(http://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT05NjI5MDA5MzI1MDc0NzMyNTQmYz1rNGo4JmU9MTkyOCZiPTE5NjYzMzMzMCZkPWkweDZwNGs=.ttFCj234VUAi6pIJpl54UtLe4pNrObGHTfg0OxGJwDg). Now US Investors can buy Bitcoin at Nasdaq through their Retirement &amp; Brokerage Accounts.

The small touchscreen does limit his ability to Rip and Tear, but he still seems to be having fun.  
&amp;nbsp;  

At some point, @spudowiar stopped goofing around and actually [got the money out of the wallet](http://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT05NjI5MDA5MzI1MDc0NzMyNTQmYz1rNGo4JmU9MTkyOCZiPTE5NjYzMzMzOCZkPWgweTBwMHY=.Wzo9XRbvL2HQMZn1V8j8IvVuocgKMcbdTn3rj6K6fdg) by perpetuating the [Evil Maid Attack](http://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT05NjI5MDA5MzI1MDc0NzMyNTQmYz1rNGo4JmU9MTkyOCZiPTE5NjYzMzM0MCZkPXoyazVqMWc=.huRjeeLSPZceRhfKzmWjVDod1FeXfFj89Tx8CXQb41Q).

**SEC Can't Sneak Off**  
&amp;nbsp;  

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [is ready to approve](http://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT05NjI5MDA5MzI1MDc0NzMyNTQmYz1rNGo4JmU9MTkyOCZiPTE5NjYzMzM0OCZkPWswdjF1OWo=.6R-k7CYLDiJf38UnvgzBh1vylH7OL4Nzj93HHyjrKZk) or reject another pair of proposed ETFs ProShares.  
&amp;nbsp;  

ProShares initially proposed the futures-based ETFs in September 2017. But as the company itself noted that the bitcoin futures market was young, and the proposal was rejected.  
Unlike the earlier decision on VanEck and SolidX, this time the SEC can’t take additional time for reflection by following their own rules. We might be watching history happen.  
&amp;nbsp;  
 
&gt;**Technical analysis**  
 
&amp;nbsp;  

**What happened to Bitcoin This Week**  
&amp;nbsp;  

Since the last BTW price analysis Bitcoin has been on $5900 and $6625 levels and formed the ascending triangle pattern between them. And we know, that in most cases the price moves down from the triangle, especially from its corner. So it did with Bitcoin. After the breakout price declined to $6230 and now is pulling back. But the lower border of the triangle acts as a resistance line. Although it’s not very strong.  
&amp;nbsp;  

[4H chart](https://i.imgur.com/57THLKC.png?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hard_to_pull_up&amp;utm_term=2018-08-21)  
&amp;nbsp;  

Strong resistance zone is visible between $6525 and $6600 range, close to the upper border of the triangle.
Support zone is harder to identify, but we would say it is a $5800 point.
Indicators are in the middle range, so they can move in any direction. Making any specific conclusions is hard.  
&amp;nbsp;  

[1D chart](https://i.imgur.com/fKyRKU7.png?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hard_to_pull_up&amp;utm_term=2018-08-21)  
&amp;nbsp;  

The primary thing we can say about the daily chart is “it’s flat”. 20 range moving average is heading down, while 50 and 100 show us a sideways trend. And the price itself is moving inside a narrow channel: support zone is $5860 - $6000, resistance - $6640.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Stochastic is in the middle zone, just like on the 4H chart. But the MACD indicator on the 1D chart — which serves the strongest signals — is very close to the bullish signal. However, higher volumes on the bearish candles than on the bullish ones is not a good sign.  
&amp;nbsp;  

The conclusion is not so informative, as the Bitcoin price chart right now. Ascending triangle on a 4H chart gives the closest resistance zone. But the daily chart mainly shows us a flat market. We suppose that strong movement will not occur until the consolidation is over. Until then — wait and watch.

67 WALLETS CONTROL 56% of BCH,"This is exactly why the whales have trouble manipulating Bitcoin; they don’t have as much control which is why BTC remains over $6K. Even though roughly 40% of Bitcoin is owned by whales, the disparity is even more significant with BCash. There are many ominous signs of a bear market: (1) the % of crypto the whales control, (2) the % of the crypto market that is BTC - a higher BTC Dominance is usually a bear sign and (3) the amount of daily/monthly volume. Unfortunately, all three of these signs are not pointing favorably. But, altcoins continue to be dangerous because the whales have such a strong-arm over them.

Among the various types of swaps he was working on ([click here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rgq0c/lightning_network_submarine_swaps/e0rmtfe/) for a rundown in text), a tech called ""submarine swaps"" was the one he was closest to completing. Submarine swaps can be explained in several ways, but one of them is this: it allows basically any blockchain user with almost any type of cryptocurrency to make payments on the lightning network without even running a lightning node. In principle it can work with any cryptocurrency that supports a few very basic scripts, ones that almost all of them already support. By this method you can trustlessly pay lightning invoices using basically any cryptocurrency, not just using bitcoin's blockchain, but using almost any cryptocurrency. Eventually it will also allow you to use the lightning network to make onchain payments on any supported blockchain -- but right now only blockchain-to-lightning payments are supported, and not vice versa.

All you need to know about Bitcoin and how to collect it," It appeared that the presence of the recent range of electronic currencies, which are different from concrete in many things, and an estimated number of these currencies are currently sixty currencies all work on the principle of encryption, making it also called currency encryption, which is the first in terms of presence and the most common Bitcoin currency.  


 And this currency appeared in a research paper in 2008 by a person calling himself the name Satoshi Nakamoto, whom he described as being a currency based on the Balnd principle by peers-that is, that it can be exchanged without resorting to a mediator, introduced the first time negotiation in the third of January 2009, In 2016, the Australian businessman King Stephen Light presented a technical guide on the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto was the source of the currency.  


 The function of Bitcoin more important than it is not a monetary base of which they are not subject to the control of any government agency has been, and this is what makes its users Alqubunha digital currency unknown, meant more than they have no serial number or any other means of keeping track of what has been passed to the seller or buyer who relieved the heart Privacy lovers as well as sellers of prohibited products online.

Coinbase and bitcoin cash,"Hi,
I belatedly got into the Crypto market about a month ago.  
I've spent a solid month cramming Crypto, but at the beginning I went to a major bitcoin website that has been linked with some shady practices. I downloaded their wallet, and I very nearly ended up with some Bitcoin cash. 
  
Fast forward a month. I'm still total noob but I'm currently trying to see a reason that coinbase would sell and actively promote bitcoin cash.  
It's plainly steeped in shady practice, and if I wasnt quicker on the uptake I would be part of that scam myself right now.  
  
I feel uncomfortable using a service that supports an obvious scam, can you recommend another platform I can buy Crypto on?

How to justify bitcoin transfers to my bank and economic crime sector?," Hello everyone.   


I have been doing bitcoin exchange for 1 year and 6 months. Till now I haven't had a problem with banks and taxes. I just meet with my clients, receive the bitcoins, give them the money and then use Bitstamp to transfer the money to my bank account. My monthly volume was 2000-3000 US Dollars.   
Yesterday, a guy whom I met in a bar (friend of a friend) asked me if I was willing to buy him bitcoins. Of course, I said yes. He was willing to sell me 10-20k$ of bitcoins per week. Now I am thinking...  


How can I verify that my profit is 5% of that sum of money and then I can pay taxes for my profit? The seller identity should remain safe of course. This is one of the main reasons people sell btc for cash.  


So if I get 40k$ a month in my bank account, how can I verify that my profit is 2000$.  


There are no laws for bitcoin in my country, and I don't think buying in cash is illegal.

"BIP171 - Specs, Mock server, template project and client librairies","Hello,  
I worked on the [BIP 171](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0171.mediawiki) and I created [Cerise](http://www.cerise.tech/) ([github](https://github.com/straumat/cerise)) that provides the following artifacts :

* [BIP-0171 specifications](http://www.cerise.tech/#specifications).
* A [mocked BIP-0171 compliant server available online](http://api.cerise.tech/swagger-ui.html) you can use to understand the API and make calls.
* A [mocked BIP-0171 compliant server as a Java application](https://github.com/straumat/cerise-server-mock/) you can use to develop your client application.
* A [mocked BIP-0171 compliant server as a Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/straumat/cerise-server-mock/) you can use to develop your client application.
* A [BIP-0171 library](https://github.com/straumat/cerise/) to transform your application in a BIP-0171 server.
* A [server template project](https://github.com/straumat/cerise-server-template) to quickly write your implementation and automatically produce your BIP-0171 server.
* A collection of [client libraries](http://www.cerise.tech/#clients) to call any BIP-0171 compliant server with your favorite language.

Thought experiment - value of Bitcoin if convertibility to fiat was no longer possible,"Let's say that in 2 weeks time, the ability to exchange Bitcoin for *any* government's fiat will no longer be possible, and that this is made known today. (We could say that governments will outlaw it, but since this is a thought experiment, let's just say that *something* will make it truly impossible, for all time.) What do you think the value of Bitcoin priced in, say, USD, would be right before that exchange window closed?

To be clear, the restriction only applies to getting fiat. You can keep whatever Bitcoin you have. You can exchange it freely with others in exchange for goods and services if they so desire. You can acquire more Bitcoin in exchange for your goods and services. If stores continue to accept Bitcoin, you can pay in Bitcoin. These things will not change. You cannot, however, *ever* again get any fiat for your Bitcoin.

This is announced today. Prices have 2 weeks to adjust to this forthcoming reality. What's the last BTC/USD price on the tape before convertibility is suspended forever?",1534894103,21/08/2018 23:28:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9986xb/thought_experiment_value_of_bitcoin_if/,1

Hyping Crypto is a Waste of Time,"Bitcoin won't take off until lightning nodes are so refined, and with good enough user-interface, that people don't even have to know what lightning is, or how it works to use it.  Widespread use isn't even conceivable until at least no coding is needed to get a node running.  If it's harder to use than a credit card, then most people won't use it.  Don't kid yourself about that.

Give the engineers time; they are doing something ridiculously complicated, and gloriously experimental.  Don't think you have to spend your life watching the crypto news, just because you have crypto in your portfolio.  The biggest winners are the people who forget they had some Bitcoin somewhere, and find it again years later.  They got to keep having life outside crypto, and then they get the returns anyway.  Trading is overrated.

Trying to hype Bitcoin is a waste of time.  When it's good and ready, people will switch over.",1534895939,21/08/2018 23:58:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/998f5r/hyping_crypto_is_a_waste_of_time/,1

"An important matter: When Bcash forks into two lying shitcoins rather than one, what shall we call each of them?","One proposal has been: Bcash Ver1 and Bcash Ver2.

Another suggestion is: Bcash Core and Bcash Cash.

One wag has suggested: Bcash SV (with SV standing for 'Satoshi's Vision')  This name was proposed by Satoshi himself, 'Dr' Craig Wright.

Bitcoin works upon consensus, and we should sort these matters out.

I propose: Failed lying shitcoin 1 and Failed lying shitcoin 2.

Also there was something or entity telling me that 60K is nothing there is more to come.

I am not even invested in BTC but I finds Cryptocurrency interesting.

Technical And Fundamental Differences," 

Technical Analysis

Technicians (sometimes called ‘chartist’ alias traders using a technical approach) take a practical approach, look at the history of security (using price charts) and apply various analytical tools to gain a better understanding of how the market responses about the security of a particular asset.

The technicians know that they can see past the volatility and identify the uptrend as they see the higher order of the highest and highest values ​​of the lowest value. By analyzing the average moves, traders can get a better estimate when there is a shift memontum. That way they can know when is the best time to buy or sell their assets.

Fundamental Analysis

Unlike technical analysis, price is the main focus with fundamental analysis so it is almost the opposite of the technical system. You want to find a basic, or intrinsic, value of security. Anything that affects firm value is a fundamental component of analysis, whether it involves major influences such as the economy as a whole or the specific factors such as company management, revenue, profit growth, and profit margins. Instead of using technical charts, merchants look for difficult data for security evaluation. The company’s financial statements are the starting point.",1534916370,22/08/2018 05:39:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99aq47/technical_and_fundamental_differences/,1

Bitfinex not returning funds - 3 months waiting,"Withdrawal #9702076
Ticket number: #255023

As the title says, Bitfinex will not return my funds after their bank supposedly messed up my withdrawal.

In late April of this year I attempted to withdraw ~$25,000 from Bitfinex to my bank account. There was no sign of the money so after two weeks I got in contact with support. After some back and forth it became clear the money could not be sent to my bank account and instead they would return the funds to my Bitfinex account.

This was 3 months ago. Originally it was meant to take maximum 7 business days but then they just kept requesting more time to process the refund.

Now I have threatened legal action and they still have not returned the funds. I have contacted a legal firm in the British Virgin Islands where they are registered but would like to avoid the legal fees if at all possible. 

This is is my last ditch attempt to resolve it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",1534921323,22/08/2018 07:02:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99b5tu/bitfinex_not_returning_funds_3_months_waiting/,1

Arbitrage Strategy in the Quantification of Digital Assets,,1534928435,22/08/2018 09:00:35,http://www.fmz.com,1
"""Bandwagon Effect"" in Blockchain Tourism","The blockchain travel platform，such as TUI, Travelkoin, TOOKING, LEOOY , Tripio,  appeared one by one, making people dazzled. After the financial speculation wind, blockchain tourism is also beginning to set off hot wind of tourism.A large number of followers have conceived, prepared and established their own blockchain platforms. The number of practitioners has triggered the ""bandwagon effect"" in blockchain tourism.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5c5cbtjn0mh11.jpg

Humans often have a tendency to prevent themselves from being isolated in society, so social individuals often choose the same choices as most people without thinking, and engage in or believe that what most other people engage in or believe. This is the ""bandwagon effect"".

Not only people but also companies and industries. What is the ""bandwagon effect"" in the blockchain tourism?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uwan5foo0mh11.jpg

In terms of form, various tourism companies under the blockchain technology take the advantage of the blockchain as a framework and combine relevant features such as blockchain decentralization, encryption mechanisms, and smart contracts to create tourism culture. The  “bandwagon effect” in technology has caused a large number of blockchain tourism projects that are difficult to discern. Some build projects based on the concep of blockchain，and some  are tricks for building blockchain tourism. The real blockchain tourism is rare.

In terms of content, although the main items are temporarily different, such as Travelkoin brings new payment methods to tourism suppliers, TOOKING uses hotel reservations as a gateway to achieve transactions. However, Looking at the current development trend of blockchain tourism, the blockchain tourism platform is realizing the integration of projects in different fields. For example, LEOOY covers hotel reservations, ticket reservations, scenic spot inquiries, resource sharing, social sharing and other fields, trying to create a complete industry chain for the continuous development of the cultural tourism industry.That is the sign of integration. With the continuous progress of blockchain tourism and  the mutual competition and reference among various platforms, the integration trend of blockchain tourism will become more apparent, just like the OTA platform that has emerged. In the future, these blockchain tourism platforms will also look similar in terms of content.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wf76q0pp0mh11.png

The reasons for the emergence of “bandwagon effect” in blockchain tourism can be divided into two aspects.

On the one hand, the ideology of the company is deep-rooted and does not want to be excluded.The atmosphere of“join us, otherwise it is against everyone”requires companies to accept some kind of idea that seems to be widely accepted among the industry. On the other hand, the rich interests also drove everyone to follow. Under the blockchain outlet, all tourism companies are afraid to take a late step back from this promising tourist market.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1jbv8gar0mh11.png

In terms of the objective impact of“bandwagon effect” in blockchain tourism , it has both positive and negative significance. Blockchain technology is gradually proved to be a technology that is not lost to cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence. As a part of blockchain applications, the development of blockchain tourism will undoubtedly expand it. Moreover, blockchain tourism as an industry with great advantages,it will establish a more transparent, safe and credible platform network for the majority of users， in the future.But in most cases, the herd behavior has blindness.When a product is proved to be able to obtain substantial profits, is travel like a blockchain game generally caught in raising a petty circle?? This is where the blockchain tourism platform should be on the alert.

Arbitrage Strategy in the Quantification of Digital Assets,"  

In the quantitative trading of digital assets, there is a simple, well-understood and stable strategy. To say that it is simple is because a little code can fix it; it is easy to understand like how to buy things; it is stable because it captures the spread and ignores the price rise and fall. (www.fmz.com)

**First, the principle of arbitrage strategy**

The arbitrage strategy is a cross-market arbitrage strategy. The basic principle is to buy bitcoin on a low-value trading platform, and to sell the same amount of bitcoin on a high-value trading platform, thus achieving stable profitability. To put it simply: in the A market, I bought 5 pounds of apples at price of 1 yuan per pound, and then I found that the same apples in B market are sold 1 block per pound, and each apple has 5 cents spread. I earned 2.5 yuan when I sold apples in B market. Similarly, on different trading platforms, the same subject have different prices, as long as there is a spread, you can do arbitrage.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/ujaa5no81mh11.png)

**Second, arbitrage methods**

For the digital currency trading market, there are generally two ways to arbitrage:

1. When you see the price difference between the two markets, immediately buy coins on the low-priced trading platform A, and then move your coins to the high-priced trading platform B to sell and obtain the spread profit. This method is more traditional, commonly known as ""moving bricks.""

2. Use computer program to do arbitrage. In the initial state, put the same amount of coins and the same amount of money on two trading platforms. When you find that there is a price difference between the two markets, you immediately buy the coins on the low-priced trading platform A, and then sell the same amount of coins on the high-priced trading platform B. So the total amount of coins held in the hands has not changed, but the money has increased. Because the program is very fast, you can quickly seize the opportunity and gain profits.

**Third, problems we are facing**

It seems very simple, but there are actually some problems to think about:

1. The risk of “moving bricks” is: because the speed of withdrawing coins in different trading platforms is different, the trading platform needs to confirm the blockchain after the coins are issued, and the price of the two markets is likely to reverse in period of withdrawing coins. After this, the spread may disappear or even reverse, then it was impossible to sell and gain profit.

2. Program arbitrage looks perfect, but there are risks: program trading needs to call the API interface of the trading platforms, so once the API fails, it will cause losses. Another risk is that because of the unilateral market, there will be situation that a trading platform is only money while the other trading platform only has coins, so that it is impossible to conduct bilateral trading, and only wait for the price difference to reverse, or manually withdraw money or coins, which involved the risks mentioned in “moving bricks”.

Therefore, if you want to make money, you still need to think carefully. However, using computer program has relatively larger advantages. If there is no accident, then every profit can be grasped, and more important is to save time and energy.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/wun7naoe1mh11.jpg)

**Fourth, the problem of program arbitrage to deal with**

To do program arbitrage, except the above risks, the following small problems also needs to be solved:

1. How to connect the real market

Each trading platform has its own interface. After each interface is connected according to the document, the measurement can be written.

2. which to deal first, the purchase order first, or the sell order

It is recommended to process the sell order first and then the purchase order. The reason is: Bitcoin is a floating asset. Realize the floating asset and then purchase is an optimal short-term position control method.

3. How to ensure that the number of transactions in the two orders is the same

In order to ensure the two orders are in same number of transactions, the program needs to get the execution result of the previous sell order before executing the buy order, and then set the quantity to be bought according to the result.

4. When to trigger bitcoin transfer and fund transfer between trading platforms

In fact, everyone has a different way. The general approach is to set a minimum position line for the two trading platforms. If the position of any trading platform touches the line, it triggers a bitcoin transfer and funds transfer between the trading platforms. Transfer. The result of the transfer is that the two trading platforms have the same coins and same money.

Sum up: The arbitrage strategy is to put the same amount of money and coins on the two trading platforms. When there is a spread, sell high and buy low, and keep the amount of coins unchanged, and make the money gradually increase. Although the arbitrage strategy trading strategy does not have a lot of profit after deducting the fee for each transaction, because the spread of each trading platform is common, the program can be running 24 hours, and the profit is still considerable for a long time.

Digital currency quantitative arbitrage," 

**Digital currency quantitative arbitrage**

There are many global digital currency exchanges, and the same currency in market is not always effective in pricing due to many factors affecting. The same pair has spread among two or more exchanges. As long as there is a spread, there is arbitrage. Arbitrage through spreads is basically risk free in the digital currency market. ([www.fmz.com](http://www.fmz.com/))

       Suppose the EOS/USDT pair: the price in Huobi is 11, the price in Binance is 10, and the EOS has spread of 1 USDT between the two exchanges. Suppose you hold 1 EOS in Huobi, following the principle of selling high and buying low, sell 1 EOS in Huobi to get 11 USDT, spend 10 USDT to buy 1 EOS in Binance, then you net earned 1 USDT, and the amount of EOS remains unchanged. Although there is such a spread, manual arbitrage often has many uncertainties due to the time-consuming, poor accuracy and price changes of manual operations. Through the quantitative model to capture arbitrage opportunities and develop arbitrage trading strategies, and programmatic algorithms automatically release trading orders to the exchange, quickly and accurately capture opportunities, and efficiently earn income, which is the charm of quantitative arbitrage.

![img](gcx7q5p4cmh11 ""www.fmz.com"")

1. Cross-market two-side hedging arbitrage

       The two-side arbitrage is also called direct arbitrage and bilateral arbitrage. It is through the discovery that the same transaction pair (like: EOS/USDT) has a spread in two different exchanges, and the behavior of high-selling and low-buying to take the spread profit.

The amount of hedged profit and loss is equal, and the same base currency is bought and sold in both markets to ensure that quote currency is transferred.

Suppose the Huobi EOS/USDT price is 8, and the Okex EOS/USDT price is 10. Follow the principle of buying low &amp; selling high. Suppose that there are 100 USDTs held in Huobi and 10 EOSs in Okex, the arbitrage process:

1) Use 80 USDT to buy 10 EOS in Huobi, and then there are 10 EOS and 20 USDT in Huobi account.

2) Sell 10 EOS in Okex to get 100USDT, then there are 0 EOS and 100 USDT in Okex account.

After 1 round (1, 2 can be simultaneously carried out) hedging transactions (10 EOS for the amount of hedging), the user still has 10 EOSs, and the number of USDT becomes 120, and the net profit is 20 USDT.

When the high-priced market holds base currency or the low-priced market holds quote currency or fiat, it can carry out two-way cyclic hedge arbitrage.

(www.fmz.com)

When there is no base currency in the high-priced market or no quote currency in the low-priced market, arbitrage needs to put fiat in the low-price market.

When the arbitrage gain is greater than the arbitrage cost, and it’s stored in fiat account, you can perform cyclic arbitrage. (Moving bricks needs to pay attention to time risk)

2. Cross-market triangle hedge arbitrage

        Triangular arbitrage, also known as indirect arbitrage or multilateral arbitrage, is to use three or more currency exchange rate spreads for trading in three or more trading markets at the same time. Triangular arbitrage is the arbitrage of cross-exchange rate pricing errors. If EOS/USDT=10, EOS/ETH=0.01, ETH/USDT=500, the fair price of ETH/USDT formed as 1000 by EOS/USDT and EOS/ETH cross-price, and the current price of ETH/USDT is 500. There is spread for arbitrage.

If EOS/ETH=0.5, EOS/USDT=10, USDT/ETH=0.01, the fair price of EOS/ETH formed by EOS/USDT, USDT/ETH is 400, and the current price of ETH/USDT is 500. Poor, follow the principle of buying low &amp; selling high, can carry out arbitrage. as the picture shows:

Suppose you initially have 2 EOS, and you sell to get 1 ETH, then sell 1 ETH to get 100 USDT, and then sell 100 USDTs to get 10 EOS. After the triangle round, the number of EOS is changed from the initial 2 to 10.

3. triangle loop arbitrage in same exchange

Based on the principle of triangular arbitrage, use the spread of three pairs on the same exchange to trade, and there is no need to remove your currency. Calculated by 10,000 yuan, even if the arbitrage gain is only 0.1%, if one thousand times of arbitrages is executed in one day, the one-day income will become 21,700 annualized income, and no need to remove currency in account, never.

Is Bitcoin script now Turing complete?,"I know that Bitcoin script is traditionally thought of as NOT Turing complete. It doesn't allow loops, which was apparently intentional to prevent shitty code from accidentally creating an infinite loop or from spammers sending infinite loops to bog down the network. I get all of that.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm seeing/reading things that suggest Bitcoin script has been made Turing complete and can now support smart contracts.

"Bitcoin and the three ""values"" of a currency","an interesting comment from u/ZiggyPenner a year ago.

These bitcoin price spikes are an unavoidable consequence of its design. We are watching what in a normal economy would be considered a deflationary spike.

Currencies have 3 purposes: 1. Act as a medium of exchange 2. Act as a store of value 3. Act as the unit of account

The first two are relevant to this discussion.

These two purposes work together and against one another depending on the situation.

Due to Bitcoin's underlying design limiting the amount of total currency, it very strongly fulfills the second purpose. It's utility as a medium of exchange is also undeniable, particularly for anonymous transaction, fulfilling the first purpose.

These deflationary spikes represent the push and pull of the two purposes.

Because of the limited number of bitcoins, whenever there is deflation (rising bitcoin price) it gives a very strong incentive for existing holders to stop trading them and hold. Prices steadily rise and then spike as fewer people are willing to trade them. However, if no one is trading them, their utility as a means of exchange drops accordingly.

The deflationary spike ends when so few people are trading bitcoins on the market that it is no longer a usable currency. Demand for the currency drops accordingly. Falling demand causes the value to begin dropping. Now the currency no longer fulfills either of its purposes. Those holding panic and begin selling. The currency price crashes accordingly.

As the price drops the currency slowly begins being useful for trade again, as lots are available. The price crash slows as the trade utility increases demand once again, putting a floor under the drop.

Once stabilized the currency begins fulfilling both duties very well. The underlying deflationary nature of the currency then takes hold once again, restarting a slowly rising currency price. Restarting the cycle.",1534937646,22/08/2018 11:34:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99ck19/bitcoin_and_the_three_values_of_a_currency/,1

And theres nothing wrong with that. Enough of this “Not your keys not your coins” trash for the future of bitcoin. If we really want it to be treated like a digital cash it needs to be simple to use and adopted in any way possible.

Theres some that will 100% downvote here because they don’t trust banks or whatever. Those are the same people that keep all their net worth in cash tucked under their bc even though their cash is insured in a bank they don’t trust the system.

Is it worth getting one, I really don't care if I make my money back, I want to play around and see if I can make some money.",1534946250,22/08/2018 13:57:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99djyt/is_it_worth_buying_a_mining_rig_and_getting_into/,1
Bitcoin bottom to be reached yet?,"What do you guys think about the recent surge? Was it really manipulation by bitmex since it directly happened after they did their ""maintenance""? Sounds a bit odd for me to be honest.
Might it be manipulation to squeeze the shorts out, because we might get an etf denial tomorrow? This article states 3 possible ways we could go now:
1) bottom reached, time to up
2) bottom between 4.000-5.000$ to have a similar decline to 2014
3) doomsday : bottom at around 1.200$

What do you guys think?

No conspiracy theory needed to explain the short squeeze during the Bitmex' scheduled maintenance,"Bitcoin is more resilient than stocks, because stocks are traded on 1-2 exchanges (sometimes only 1), but Bitcoin is traded on many exchanges, like fiat currencies (Forex).

I think that the Bitmex downtime had some role (when it was offline arbitrage bots was offline too, causing liquidity to decrease and make short squeeze more **probable**), but most journalists and ""Bitcoin analysts"" will exaggerate it.

If Bitmex did not went down to maintenance, it's very probable that the short squeeze would happened anyway. Short positions to long positions ratio on Bitfinex were at record high (see ""BTCUSDSHORTS-BTCUSDLONGS"" on TradingView).

No conspiracy theory is needed to explain the short squeeze. It's obvious for all market participants that the best time for short squeeze is when the liquidity is low and short positions on Bitfinex (one of the major spot exchanges allowing shorting on margin) are at record high.

This is why ""smart money"" started to open long positions around the time when liquidity is expected to be low (Bitmex scheduled maintenance) and short positions at record high level.

Security question about Coinbase login...,"Would it be more secure if I buy an iPhone that I only use to login into Coinbase? I've heard iPhones are more secure...and if I only use it for Coinbase login, with no other apps on the phone. Would this make it hyper secure?

I would probably get a cheap $10/15 per month phone plan. But only use it in my home wifi.

Is there a better way to make my Coinbase account more secure...

My first BTC profit purchase. Although a mistake was made.,"https://imgur.com/a/0tmG7RD

So a short story. I bought in early enough last year to have a hefty profit still even in this bear market. I'm very stingy with my BTC's and only spend them when I can purchase the amount of BTC I lost in a short period of time. So most purchases are hundreds of dollars or less.

Acting on complete heart-felt-idiocy and impulse I stumbled upon this travel trailer and thought ""I need that"". Having the available credit on my credit card I just slapped it on there, taking a cash advance out in a hurry in order to not miss the deal and paying cash for it.

I'm giddy happy for 1 month. Then credit card bill arrives, cash advance fee 20 something %. Oh shit. What did I do.

So under a heavy finger, I pushed half my BTC over to USD to pay off that shitty choice. I have half my BTC left, but man it hurt.

I know I'm an idiot, HOWEVER.

I do now own a travel trailer that my family can use for years to come and have no payments on it. And that does make me feel good.

Anyways, thats my lambo story. Don't be stupid like Ashmai kids.",1534966153,22/08/2018 19:29:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99gcf7/my_first_btc_profit_purchase_although_a_mistake/,1

Bitcoin adoption by country: An Analysis,"We set out to answer the question: **is Bitcoin adoption actually as global as some media outlets would have  us believe?** The truth is that most cryptocurrency trading is done on  crypto exchanges or in the over the counter (OTC) market. The problem with these ways of buying Bitcoin is that there is no public  data on how much Bitcoin is being bought and sold in each country.

However, Bitcoin country data is available for LocalBitcoins. It must be noted that the $6.3 billion traded on LocalBitcoins is a  fraction of the global trade volume. Still, there is more than enough  data to get a reasonably accurate idea of the levels of Bitcoin adoption  in specific countries.

# Our Analysis

fter analysis of the 46 country datasets for LocalBitcoins, it appears  that Bitcoin trading on the platform is extremely concentrated. **72% of  all Bitcoin trading happened in the top 5 countries: USA, Russia, UK,  Venezuela, and China.** What exceptionally interesting is that all of the countries making up  the top 4 in the all-time country volume leaderboard have some kind of  problem with their native currencies.

# USA

The first thing to note is that **over the last 104 years, the USD has lost more than 96% of its value.** The era of quantitative easing funneled billions or trillions of dollars  into markets like the stock market and real estate. Massive bubbles  have been formed in traditional markets. With the FED beginning to raise  interest rates, the stage is set for a correction in these traditional  markets. In this sort of environment, it fundamentally makes sense for investors  to look at hedges like gold and Bitcoin for wealth preservation.

# Russia

**In May 2018, the Ruble had officially lost 9% of its value against the  dollar.** It goes without saying that a 9% depreciation in the purchasing  power of imported goods, is not good news for the Russian people. It appears that Russians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin to hedge against the devaluation of the Ruble.

# The United Kingdom

The problem is that £26 trillion worth of EU derivatives contracts  expire after Brexit. Unless an agreement is made, these contracts are  all at risk. **It’s been estimated that £70 trillion worth of trades could  be impacted after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.** UK insurance  companies could also lose access to the £55bn insurance market. As of  now, no progress has been made to secure the UK’s access to EU markets  after Brexit.

The future for the UK and its currency looks uncertain. With this  drama unfolding in the background, it is maybe not surprising that more  and more UK residents are turning to Bitcoin to preserve their post-Brexit wealth.

# Venezuela

**Venezuela is heading towards one million percent inflation** and economic Armageddon. Shops are empty, wheelbarrows full of money are being used  to buy normal items and people are dying of starvation. In this environment, it is no wonder that Bitcoin use is on the rise.  Cryptocurrencies are maybe the best way for everyday people to get  around oppressive government controls and preserve what little wealth  they have.

Venezuela is perhaps the best example in the world today that shows  that Bitcoin can be used to hedge against government incompetence.

# Conclusion

Since 2008, many commentators argue that financial institutions such  as the World Bank, European Central Bank, FED and the Bank of Japan,  have done little to solve the underlying problems that caused the 2008  financial crisis.

Hopefully, we’ll avoid another global financial crisis. However, the warning signs are there for all to see. And with a whopping majority of Bitcoin trading being done in just five countries Bitcoin has a long way to go before it can be deemed a truly global currency.

I believe we have things backwards,"Andreas is a hero of mine, so I don't oppose his opinions without due consideration, but it seems a weird situation to me that we have cash settled futures leveraged trading, and shorting, but we don't have a physically backed ETF. Futures and leverage as per the CBOE &amp; BitMex are far more likely to lead to price manipulation and volatility that an ETF backed by real bitcoin is. 

I urge the community:

1. Learn about, and understand the difference between a physically  backed ETF, and a futures or derivatives based ETF
2. Stop vilifying physically backed ETFs
3. Fight against any form of cash settled futures, leveraged trading &amp; naked shorting.

SEC does not like futures based Bitcoin ETFs,"&gt; Bitcoin Futures Contracts are a new type of futures contract to be traded on the CFE and CME or other U.S. exchanges (if available). Unlike the established futures markets for traditional physical commodities, the market for Bitcoin Futures Contracts is in the development stage and has very limited trading and operational history. As such, the liquidity of the market for Bitcoin Futures Contracts will depend on, among other things, the supply and demand for Bitcoin Futures Contracts, the adoption of bitcoin and the commercial and speculative interest in the market for Bitcoin Futures Contracts and the potential ability to hedge against the price of bitcoin with exchange-traded Bitcoin Futures Contracts.

It’s been going up and down between $5800 and $7000 for awhile now and I could’ve increased my BTC holdings by buying low and selling high every few days.

"Sale of business and receiving BTC as payment, Coinbase best place to liquidate?","Crossposting for some more visibility..  


I'm looking at options for liquidating the BTC we would receive for the sale of a business. At current prices it will be in the neighborhood of 650 BTC.

I intend to hold 5%-10% in BTC and sell the rest for USD. I understand the withdrawal limits and would obviously try to get them raised after the sale, but I'm more concerned with making sure I get a current price for the BTC

Placing limit orders seems like it could take a while, and while I don't mind the relatively small fee for a market order I don't know how far the price will slip on a sale order vs. buy order, or if unloading that much BTC is even feasible in the first place.

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.,"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.

Circle Pay,"After multiple failed attempts to try to transfer money to my own separate banking account on a separate card that I had with circle pay, the app gave me multiple reasons why the funds could not be transferred at first. After they had successfully removed the funds from my account, the app then goes on to tell me that my account is under review and will take up to 1 to 3 business days. This app is supposed to be instantaneous so when requesting my money to be put back into my account, I realized that the Circle Pay app has no customer service line, and then it asked that you email a support team. I emailed the support team multiple times with no response I am completely upset and disgusted and disappointed in how this business conducts the removal and transferral of funds. I have over $200 stuck on the Circle Pay app with no way to access my funds. I believe that this is a complete scam and I would not recommend using this app to anyone. Although it has not been a full 24 hours, I believe that a reputable business would at least have a customer service hotline or a 24 hour emailing team that would be able to assist me at anytime with these issues. I could also understand if the funds were still accessible to me and they were still reviewing the account and I just was not able to send and/or transfer money. At this point in time I do not have access to any of the phones that rIGHTFULLY BELONG to me. I’m afraid at this point my money has been stolen and will contact the Better Business Bureau, the attorney general, and file a claim with my bank if the funds are not returned to my account within 24 hours. I am writing this review to warn anyone who is attempting to use this app. I do not believe that this is a reputable company and maybe I overlooked something when creating my account that stated all of this but to me that does seem like a scam. THIS is a warning to the consumer. DO not use Circle Pay if you want instant deposit, stick to using Cash app.",1534999005,23/08/2018 04:36:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99kdlb/circle_pay/,1
CBoE Futures - It is how they infiltrated and how you lost your power.,"As an outsider, I have always viewed the CBoE Futures trading date of 12/10/17 as the day Bitcoin got taken over by the short sellers. 

The reason Bitcoin grew in value is because most who bought it ended up holding onto it. Its seems simple like a simple supply and demand scenario. Fewer sellers than buyers. Having a hardcore base provides a lot of support for upside moves. In hindsight, it makes perfect sense.

What also makes perfect sense is that letting the rot of Wall Street infiltrate your trading in such an easy way was a mistake. Enter player Number 2. This guy hates your face and will short you into oblivion. He will ensure that every technical rally fails, every negative chart pattern plays out badly, and he will ensure any rally is quickly destroyed.

Now you get to deal with:

- artificial price pinning weekly/monthly/quarterly
- random stupid shit having an outsized impact
- everyone on TV having an opinion about Bitcoin
- FUD
- people profiting massively over price collapses

You guys had it...Bitcoin didn't need to get involved with the public markets so much. It wasn't necessary. You were free from all of this and you all got suckered into this!

I say this as a Tesla investor who is dying for the day where Tesla is finally private. The day can't come soon enough.

I long for a day where there isn't anyone on the other side of the bet.

MetLife Asia Affiliate Trials Blockchain Insurance Product," 

LumenLab, an affiliate to insurance giant MetLife’s Asia bureau, has successfully trialed a blockchain-powered insurance product to offer financial protection to pregnant women with a risk of gestational diabetes.

According to a news release published Monday, the product, dubbed “Vitana,” will connect its customers’ electronic medical records to their mobile devices to issue a policy in just a few minutes using a blockchain platform. The system will also make automatic payouts should a customer receive a diagnosis, without requiring customers to file a claim for benefits.

Vitana will be dedicated to women with gestational diabetes, a condition that affects up to one in five expectant mothers in Singapore, where LumenLab is based.

Zia Zaman, MetLife’s chief innovation officer in Asia and CEO of LumenLab, said in the release:

&gt;“In today’s world, people expect experiences to be simple, automated, and digital. We saw an opportunity to test how blockchain can make insurance more seamless and we’ve partnered with some of the best companies in their fields to create a blueprint to launch new parametric insurance products in the future.”

In addition, Vitana will also provide improved data security as it performs “parametric underwriting,” meaning that the insurance company will not need to access to the underlying medical data to confirm patients’ insurability.

Notably, the product was developed in a regulatory sandbox under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and was highlighted in MAS’ annual report as one of the “key innovations” in the initiative.

Vitana is currently under a six-month-long experiment and will be open to Singapore-based patients.

Heart breaking news About Bitcoin ETF rejections again by SEC. Covered to you by Cointelegraph!,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected a total of nine applications to list and trade various Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from three different applicants, according to a three separate orders published by the SEC today, August 22.

The disapprovals come one day ahead of the anticipated deadline, August 23, stipulatedfor a pair of BTC ETFs that had been submitted by ProShares in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ETF exchange NYSE Arca.

The SEC has now rejected a further seven proposed ETFs alongside the ProShares pair–– these being five further proposed ETFsfrom Direxion, also for listing on NYSE Arca –– and two proposals from GraniteShares, for listing on CBOE.

For all three disapprovals, the SEC has stated that:

""[T]he Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, the Exchange has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that a national securities exchange's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.""

The SEC has today reinforced its qualms over inadequate “resistance to price manipulation” in an insufficiently sized BTC derivatives market. In the case of ProShares’ two ETFs –– and repeated in the two other disapproval orders –– the SEC has stated that:

“Among other things, the Exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.’ That failure is critical because, as explained below, the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin is necessary.”

As a March 2018 registration statement from the SEC noted, “the [ProShares] Funds do not intend to hold Bitcoin Futures Contracts through expiration, but instead intend to either close or ‘roll’ their respective positions.” This had been specifically designated as a potential risk for the two ETFs in question –– in addition to the “extreme volatility and low liquidity” attributed to both Bitcoin spot and derivatives markets.

In today’s three orders, the SEC has however notably stated that:

""[The agency] emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.""

The SEC’s fresh disapprovals echo the concerns the agency had already articulated in its initial rejection of a high-profile Bitcoin ETF application from the Winklevoss twins in March 2017:

”When the spot market is unregulated –– there must be significant, regulated derivatives markets related to the underlying asset with which the Exchange can enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement.”

This July the SEC rejected the Winklevoss’ petition following their initial application’s denial, in which the twins claim that crypto markets are “uniquely resistant to manipulation.” In their rejection of the petition, the agency said that “the record before the Commission does not support such a conclusion.”

At the beginning of August, the SEC delayed its decision over yet another Bitcoin ETF application –– this time filed by by investment firm VanEck and financial services company SolidX, for trading on CBOE. Notably, instead of proposing a Bitcoin futures-based fund, the application proposed a physically-backed model, which will raise the further question of custody.

Bitcoin is currently trading around $6,380, down about 2.2 percent on the day to press time.

A Bitcoin Theory of economic Dissolution,"Proposition 1: The existence of the belief in USD, in a net filled with all world currency (exp 1).

[Think of a USD net as a trap that ensnares its prey into the capitalist regime of economic activity that stimulates capital as a means of dignified and valuable action, constituting a belief that time is money and increased time spent gaining capital creates self-worth notions of a life worth living.]

EXP 1- After the world wars decimated the world, the US assumed a unique position that was successful and brought prosperity to the era, not the permanent practicality of a dominant world currency. In a way, the world put trust in an idea backed in paper by gold (old people will concur still today but millenials do not really care). 

Proposition 2: This USD net is era (1910-20??) dependent. 

EXP 2- Human history tells a story of change, duh. It would be ignorant to believe that the world will always believe that USD, backed in gold, (a limited resource) would continue as a permanent solution to control human activity. In essence, society forms either because we need it or we do not (take your pick at the famous philosophers.) Regardless, society does form and has basic needs. Maslow created a theory on basic needs that was era dependent, which is currently taught in the abstract at colleges today. However, the basic needs of human motivation directly correlate with the basic principles of economics. When humans motivation change (millennials and beyond), the basic principles of economics will too. Therefore, the bitcoin boom is an economic shift and catalyst to dissolution an eras identity. 

Proposition 3: The dissolution of an eras identity creates a sense of irrational belief in progress. 

EXP 3- The novelty of using a computers code to replace a limited resource is hogwash, right? This may be true for a prior generation. How about the millennial group and beyond? The era concerned with social security, global warming, and extreme positions of social issues of race, privilege, and acceptance of differences. The seeds of a new era have already been planted; as a millennial viewed as a weed in the elders garden of economics I declare I am not a weed. I am a person seeking to establish the meaning of the journey, hoping to make sense of a life worth living. 

My identity is one dependent upon what it all means. Perhaps there are others like me? I need an economic system that has a better argument for why my time is worth USD. If USD is just era dependent, if it is the centerpiece for how I will be able/not able to do certain things in life, do I not deserve to have my currency to be based in something better than gold? 

I use myself as an example to illustrate that my identity was born into a world on the verge of progress, whereas people born before me are the fruit, ripened to continue capitalisms misleading push to have its reach extented to all people to the farthest reaches of the planet.

If a fruit was born from a tree (the era of 1910-20??) then how can we expect for those people to understand?

Proposition 4: The criticism of bitcoin from the economic establishment is mainly based from an era of people that would lose their identity if they were to accept this form of currency.

[imagine an apple trying to leave its seed in the ground and becoming an orange]

Proposition 5: The current means of economics and its philosophical identity in regards to employment cannot coexist with these new forms of currency (such as bitcoin). 

Bitcoins Dissolution of Economics Theory: The transition of one form of currency to another is dependent upon the death (existential and philosophical, not necessarily literal) of an era of people (apples) and needs a revolutionary event to break the remaining survivors of the previous era to conform to the new system of currency (run by oranges) and their new philosophical economic motivations for how increasing individual capital creates notions of self-worth. 

Conclusion: The world is a place that changes. There is no argument that can perfectly predict how this will happen. I just wrote my theory and there are many more out there. Belief is a mysterious human phenomena that has huge impacts upon life. My theory is no better than the rest; all I ask is for an honest look into its validity. 

Imagine what it feels like to have an existential crisis. Now impose that feeling upon the era of economics that competes with bitcoin. Now place your minds eye in the abstract and ask yourself how you can bridge the gap between two incompatible means of currency?

My prediction is that cryptocurrency represents more than currency; it represents a technological transition of human progress through the creation of different economic policies that will change what it means to work. In turn, changing the philosophy that motivates us all. 

The philosophy of work itself. Take your capitalist, socialist, and communists and make a big connection and then make a new theory: That is what is happening. We are in the process of a new ideological formation that completely uproots and replaces our era of societal motivations (constitutional doctrines etc..) 

Why a person works is changing, how they will be paid is changing, and the system itself is broken. 

Cryptocurrency is that conversation that I predict will change everything.

For all those still reading, imagine that these new applications on the blockchain can create opportunities of payments mixed with human actions, creating a better balance of equal results, not just opportunities. 

More people will have stuff; less people will suffer: the basic goal of society. 

How this will all happen?

That is just beyond me. 

I am just a 28-year old bullish on bitcoin who decided to post his theory reddit.

High Frequency Trading in Bitcoin Exchanges," Introduction

In this post I analyze the presence and activity of high frequency trading in a Bitcoin exchange. Since to date this markets are extremely unregulated, such behaviour takes places with little to no constraint. I show how over 99% of orders placed are not meant to be filled, but instead to distort the perception of the market. In addition, I try to spot common HFT strategies, such as Quote Spoofing, Layering and Momentum ignition. Given the anonymous nature of these exchanges these last results are to some extent subjective. (FMZ.COM)

What is High Frequency Trading?

From Wikipedia \[1\], High-frequency trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic trading characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios that leverages high-frequency financial data and electronic trading tools.

Methodology

This analysis has been carried out with order data from the Websocket stream from GDAX, a US based digital asset exchange \[2\] owned by Coinbase. It is one of the largest markets (over 42 MM USD/day) \[3\] and it exposes a high performance socket where all orders are broadcasted. In addition, it offers some interesting features for data analysis:

Orders are timestamped (as opposed to Bitfinex, for example)

It has millisecond granularity (again, as opposed to Bitfinex)  (FMZ.COM)

It says whether an order has been matched or cancelled -one could argue that disappearing orders far from the bid/ask spread must have been cancelled (and it's true), but for orders inside the spread, this information is necessary.

While data has been captured for several days (at the time of this post I'm still capturing data), for the following analysis only data from July 21, 2017 has been taken. Mind you, there are still over 2 Million datapoints. (FMZ.COM)

Since the GDAX feed does not explicitly keep information of the current best bid/ask, a little preprocessing is needed. The best bid is the highest price for currently open BUY orders, while the best ask is the lowest price for open SELL orders. Although this calculation is not complicated nor particularly slow, it's better to explicitly append the current best bid/ask as additional columns. No further preprocessing has been carried out.

Related work

While writing this article, I came across a blog post from Philip Stubbings at Parasec \[4\], who made a similar analysis in 2014. While the amount of data differs by orders of magnitude, the findings are the same, especially concerning flashing orders. Quoting from his site:

I collected order book event data from the Bitstamp exchange over a 4 month period, between July and October (2014), resulting in a dataset of \~33 million individual events; A minuscule dataset in comparison to the throughput on ""conventional"" exchanges, see (Nanex: High Frequency Quote Spam) for example. (FMZ.COM)

While the event dataset consists of \~33 million events, these events can be broken down into individual orders and their types. In total, of the identifiable order types, there were 14,619,019 individual ""flashed orders"" (orders added and later deleted without being hit) representing 93% of all order book activity, 707,113 ""resting orders"" (orders added and not deleted unless hit) and 455,825 ""marketable orders"" (orders that crossed the book resulting in 1 or more reported trades).

As we'll soon see in this report, I recorded 2,169,450 events in less than one day. That means, the number of events per unit of time is 8 times bigger than in 2014. Flash orders are still a majority, representing over 99% of all order book activity.

HTF Strategies (FMZ.COM)

The Bocconi Students Investment Club (BSIC) \[5\] describes some strategies which the HFT traders use to distort the perception of the market. For this post I'll focus on Spoofing, Layering and Momentum Ignition.

Spoofing &amp; Layering

Quoting from BSIC \[5\]:

Spoofing is a strategy whereby one places limit orders, and removes them before they are executed. By spoofing limit orders, perpetrators hope to distort other trader’s perceptions of market demand and supply. As an example, a large bid limit order could be placed with the intention of being canceled before it is executed. The spoofer would then seek to benefit from prices rising as the result of false optimism others would see in the market structure.

Detection

There is evidence of high frequency spoofing on July 21, 2017 between 09:45:52 and 09:45:56. Let's take a look at the order book. Red points are SELL orders (3 BTC @ $2741.99), vertical grey lines are cancellations and the blue and green lines are bid and ask price, respectively.   (FMZ.COM)

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/vombd58x9th11.png)

One interesting thing is that neither the bid or ask price moves.

Also from \[5\]:

More controversial has been the act of layering which carries many similarities to outright spoofing, but differs in that orders are placed evenly across prices with the goal of reserving an early execution priority at each given price level. If the person has no trade to execute at that price point the orders are simply removed. Despite being more benign in nature, the act of layering also distorts market demand and supply perception. (FMZ.COM)

It seems to be evidence of layering. Let's take a closer look at the minute between July 21, 2017 between 09:41:00 and 9:42:00. Orders seem to push the ASK level downwards, eventually decreasing the BID price. Next, BUY orders are placed at this lowered level, to be sold when the BID price recovers. 

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/rzx4jdc0ath11.png)

Momentum ignition

Still quoting \[5\]

Momentum ignition is a strategy in which a trader aims to cause a sharp movement in the price of a stock by using a series of trades, which indicate patterns for high frequency traders, with the motive of attracting other algorithm traders to also trade that stock. The instigator of the whole process knows that after the somewhat “artificially created” rapid price movement, the price reverts to normal and thus the trader profits by taking a position early on and eventually trading out before it fizzles out.  (FMZ.COM)

To detect momentum ignition, it is important to focus on the following three main characteristics as shown in the chart below:

Stable prices and a spike in volume

A large price movement compared to the intraday volatility

Reversion to the starting price under a lower volume

The following picture from zerohedge and Credit Suisse AES Analysis illustrates this behavior. (FMZ.COM)  

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/w8kyrz67ath11.png)

**Conclusion** (FMZ.COM)

According to an interview carried out by The Atlantic \[6\] to Michael Kearns of the University of Pennsylvania and Andrew Lo at MIT, this behaviour also happens in traditional trading, and its causes are still matter of dispute. Relevant extract:

\[...\] why would a firm engage in this behavior? Lo and Kearns offered a few theories of their own about what could be happening.

To be honest, we can't come up with a good reason,"" Kearns said. What's particularly difficult to explain is how diverse and prevalent the patterns are. If algorithmic traders are simply testing new bots out -- which isn't a bad explanation -- it doesn't seem plausible that they'd do it so often. Alternatively, one could imagine the patterns are generated by some set of systemic information processing mistakes, but then it might be difficult to explain the variety of the patterns.

""It's possible that the observed patterns are not malicious, in error, or for testing, but for information-gathering,"" Kearns observed. ""One could easily imagine a HFT shop wanting to regularly examine (e.g.) the latency they experienced from the different exchanges under different conditions, including conditions involving high order volume, rapid changes in prices and volumes, etc. And one might want such information not just when getting started, but on a regular basis, since latency and other exchange properties might well be expected to change over time, exhibit seasonality of various kind, etc. The super-HFT groups might even make co-location decisions based on such benchmarks.""

BitMEX: Good Or Bad for the Bitcoin Market?,"Its pretty evident that the cat is out of the bag and a lot of crypto traders noticed what happened when BitMEX went offline for a brief period during a scheduled maintenance last night. The exchange that has traded over 1 Million Bitcoin (BTC) in a day on two occasions, has been the fan favorite for traders who are taking advantage of the bear market and want to short the digital assets of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), EOS, Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and XRP.

&amp;#x200B;

***​Its also public knowledge amongst traders that # Trading over there is as fast as greased lightning.***

&amp;#x200B;

The million dollar question?? The value of BTC is if BitMEX is a friend or enemy to the general ecosystem of Bitcoin in the crypto markets. One argument that has been postulated is that during that one hour of maintenance on BitMEX, a majority of the short positions in the global crypto markets were inactive. This then means the Bulls had a chance to go long on BTC thus triggering a buying spree and a price increment.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, one may say that shorting Bitcoin and other digital assets is simply destroying the ecosystem and even preventing the SEC from approving ETFs based on the fact that the markets are too volatile. The reason why SEC declined 8 ETF proposals is it aims to at all times prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, in short mandates to protect investors from shady trading,

&amp;#x200B;

​The other side may argue that Bitmex is the oldest derivatives trading platform and has offered great trading/ investment options and in return also grown exponentially, so instance Bitmex enting the most expensive offices in Hong Kong.

How Blockchain technology is helping merchants and customers in online shopping using digital currency?,"(Source of post - [www.onetimeapp.co](https://www.onetimeapp.co) )

&amp;#x200B;

Technology advancements lead to digitalization that further made the introduction of cryptocurrency possible. Digital currency is correlated with some terms such as Bitcoins, Ethereum, Monero, Factom which have gained popularity in these few years empowering the financial sector, providing a long-term value to business profiting one and all. Bitcoin’s usage is consistent  which helps regulates the currency supply which affects the world’s economy positively. Its potential of providing convenience to the customers is rising its acceptance and its impact likely to increase in future. 

Quick and cheap online payments through cryptocurrency has broken the traditional industry norms and gained popularity with its price hike that is  accounted to 7,726.89 U.S. dollars till june 2018 as per the [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/326707/bitcoin-price-index/). The rare concept of Bitcoins came up in 2009, anonymously that has no physical identity rather works over a network of computers, following a peer-to-peer connective approach. Functioning is decentralized and transactions done are irreversible which makes it easy for both user and vendor to do business and expand.

#### How customers are getting benefited from online shopping using digital money?

&amp;#x200B;

* **International Transactions:**  Universal transactions are surely possible, as you can purchase items from abroad without stressing about the currency conversions.
* **Low transaction charges:**  To a surprise,processing fee of Bitcoins Payments is way low as compared to your credit cards or PayPal. It’s really low-priced, typically pennies.
* **Transparency offered:**  The transactions details are available to all which anyone can verify in the blockchain ledger, giving a transparency to access the data.
* **Where the banking transaction boundary ends :** Bitcoins can be sent and received from anywhere, anytime not worrying about the bank holidays, crossing borders, robbery and theft as everything is decentralized and in your control.
* **Secure transaction for the business :** Fraud, identity theft, uninformed price-hike keeps no place in its functioning due to its high authentication and user controlled pricing.

#### How merchants are getting benefited from virtual currency?

&amp;#x200B;

* **No transaction fees:**  The merchant does not need to pay anything to send the items as the buyer already pays a very low processing fee for his purchase.
* **Worldwide trade flexibility:**  The concept keeps aside the currency restriction snag, thereby giving retailers wings to fly and expand their business globally.
* **Feasible payment modes:**  You can pay small or large amounts for your payments which are easily accepted by vendors without any payment lost risk or subscription or monthly processing fees.
* **A secure and hidden system for the business profiles :** Bitcoin payments can’t be reversed and carries no user data along with it which protects merchants from potential losses or frauds.

#### How does its Functioning goes?

The working of Bitcoins is really smooth where they can be collected and stored easily. The concept of mining is important to be familiar with for smooth proceedings. It simply works on the phenomenon of what is called “mining” and to get bitcoin as a reward point, the computer owned miner must end up solving a hard mathematical equation. If we talk about its transactions, those are smoothly cryptographed and recorded by a public ledger named [blockchains](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) making it staunch ,safe and secure.

Furthermore, the reason for huge reliance of customers over bitcoins is the Escrow service that simply acts as an arbitrator which holds money of the transacting parties. The third-party arrangement regulates and disburses the funds once the agreed conditions are met and confirmed. While these obligations are fulfilled, the funds are stored in the escrow wallet keeping the payment fully secured lessening the chances of fraud.

Bitcoin Trading is the trend of today highly authenticated with encrypted transaction which is harder to decipher. As a marketer, clench your online business presence  in the digital space to hike your revenue gains and iterate the old working ways of business. The blockchain app developers offer plenty of services in OneTime App which ensures confidentiality with advanced peer-to-peer payment platforms using distributed nature of the blockchain technology.

I just started downloading it, I have a steady 500Mb/s download speed (that's about 62.5MB/s). Is that fast enough to advance through the whole of the chain faster than new blocks are generated at the end? If so, how much time will it take me to get up-to-date, and how many more new blocks will I have to download every day on average? In case it's not fast enough, how fast would be fast enough?

The SEC contradicting itself by saying that an unregulated exchange isnt trustworthy because you could have ficticious data(manipulation) but is also trustworthy since they accept its volume and hence importance,"some people might look toward astrology for when to trade a commodity like wheat. Since astrology isnt regulated and its not under the control of the SEC, but it could possibly influence investors then by analogy, somehow the SEC thinks that no market under their control should be able to trade wheat.

If there is an unregulated exchange that trades bitcoin then its volume cant be trusted. If its volume cant be trusted then it must be discarded. If it has no volume then it is not a major player. If some investors that are in SECs influence want to look at an exchange that isnt regulated by them then they trust what data they see there at their own risk.

Question RE: Selling BTC for Western Union on LBC,"I've got a chunk of btc I'd like to trade for WU on LBC , but I know paypal has recently started freezing accounts of people who try to cash out crypto via LBC. I've got not issue with going into WU face to face and providing ID, as it's not such a large amount to raise any serious flags (&lt;$5k); but I'm wondering if Western Union will see the email that is sending me money and say: ""Hey buyer X buys BTC pays by sending them Western Union over LBC all the time, and he just bought more BTC from seller Y, lets freeze seller Y's account.""

I've had plenty of experience buying on BTC, I know the signs of a scam and to never deal with anyone with less than 1000 positive trades, and to always go with someone in the US (where I am). I'm just wondering if Western Union will see it's a payment via LBC (or from someone that buys via WU often) and shut it down or if they have rules against it. I would assume they don't because many BTC buyers have thousands of trades via WU, but I'm not sure if LBC gets mentioned to them (if that's a violation of their policy) as a third party or if there is any issues along these lines.

Any advice would be great.",1535045014,23/08/2018 17:23:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99pc0a/question_re_selling_btc_for_western_union_on_lbc/,1

Bitmex Futures Math - many people don't know how it works,"Why people open long positions if their bet is **asymmetrical in the bad way**.

If you open long position with leverage 1:1 your position will be liquidated (100% loss) when the price decrease by 49%.

The price must increase by 100% in order the to get the same profit (50% profit).

The maximum profit if price get to infinity (or really big number) is 99%.

* If the price increase 10% you will get ROI 9.09%.
* However, if the price decrease by 10% you get ROI -11%.

--

* If the price increase 20% you will get ROI 16.67%.
* However, if the price decrease by 20% you get ROI -25%.

---

* If the price increase 100% (price x2) you will get ROI 50%.

---

* If the price increase 200% (price x3) you will get ROI 66.67%.

---

* If the price increase 300% (price x4) you will get ROI 75.00%.

--

TLDR: for movements below 10% it's almost linear, but for long term traders with long positions it's useless. It's good for traders shorting with leverage 1:1 (for ""freezing"" the dollar value of the coins).

How might a general financial education influence the Bitcoin adaption?," In some countries not government's bureaucrats but the so-called ""industries' representatives"" actively express their opposition to Bitcoin. One of the potential causes of that phenomena  might be a lack of general education about money and finance. Here's an example of Malawi where more that 70% of population still remains financially illiterate.

Malawi is not an homey place for Bitcoin yet. Agriculture industry - the major pillar of Malawian economy - is low-tech and highly monopolized. Malawian population is relatively small for an African country (about 16 million), with the majority of SME potential customers localized in country's two major cities - Lilongwe and Blantyre. Harsh economic conditions, unfriendly regulatory regime, rising inflation are added by inherited deficiencies of Malawian basic telecommunication infrastructure, which largely out-of-date equipment makes Internet unattainable for 93% of local population. Mobile communication remains the only viable option for local users of all ages.

Obviously, with all that growing economic and social discrepancies Malawian government has many other serious issues besides Bitcoin to worry about. Consequently, the [Reserve Bank of Malawi](https://www.rbm.mw/) (RBM) has still kept its official opinion on Bitcoin unannounced. Same goes for other governments bureaucrats, including those from [the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development](http://www.finance.gov.mw/), which, if questioned by medias representatives on the growing Bitcoin popularity in the world, usually refer them to RMB.

However, there are plenty of other people (often self-proclaimed various industries' ""representatives""), which didn't miss an opportunity to express their unsubstantiated concerns with Malawian public unawareness with ""dangers"" posed by the world's most advanced form of instant payments. This, in its turn, raises an another issue for Malawian government - that of financial literacy. Simply by educating people about basics of money and personal finance might significantly reduce an anxiety experienced by many Malawian faced by rapid and poorly understood technological advancements.

Business Notes for Malawian Bitcoin Startups Founders:

* political climate: not friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: locally;
* industries to focus: mobile commerce, FinTech, e-jobs;
* major limitations: poor population, high administrative barriers for SME, high inflation (11%) and interest rate (at 18%), over-concentrated economy, deficit of qualified personnel, outdated infrastructure;
* stimulus: low costs, low competition, large population;
* opportunities: to find a local niche market protected from outside competitors.
* Bitcoin: not regulated (moderately negative).

MtGox Civil Rehabilitation claims now open. EVERYONE WHO CLAIMED IN THE PAST MUST CLAIM AGAIN.,"Announced today on MtGox.  
[https://www.mtgox.com/](https://www.mtgox.com/)  


People who never claimed in the past should be able to claim under Civil Rehabilation, so it is not too late.  


Deadline is **October 22nd 2018** to fill a claim. If you lost your credentials/old email used to sign on MtGox, you will not be able to claim online and will need to claim offline, so **DO NOT WAIT.**  


If you submitted a claim in the past on MtGox or with Kraken, **YOU NEED TO CLAIM AGAIN**. The procedure changed from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation and you need to submit a claim. I believe you might lose your claim if you do not submit one under the civil rehabilitation process as bankruptcy is no longer in play.  


Under civil rehabilitation, your claim is not a fixed price per BTC at time of commencement of bankruptcy. Everyone will be entitled to their fair share of all remaining BTC held by the trustee.  


All documents are published on the website. It's a long read, but all the details are there.

How ETF will make bitcoin just another brick in the wall.," 

Do you remember the energy in 2017? When the concept of blockchain  landed in the collective conscious? People from all over the world where  excited. Finally there was a new revolution. Finally there was a new  glimp o  freedom on the horizon. Wise brave minds had developed a tool  to break free from banks and governments. Blockchain tech would make  free and independent.  

We would transform the world with tech by building layers of trust  all over the internet. Those trust ecosystems would guarantee you a save  transparent place without corruption. It would connect people,  machines, information and knowledge. This all would change the world as  we know it. Corruption would be impossible, or at least traceable.  Supply and demand would find its fulfilling on the chain. Middleman  would be superfluous. Blockchain would take over much labor so humans  had not to work 5 days a week. And the best part… Why we gets excited  and fall in love with it was… it was ours, open source and decentralized  or at least everybody could join the community for free.  

Blockchain would make us free and independent. It would transform the  world  for the good. The big mothership of trust was an electronic  currency: the Bitcoin. All the transactions of this currency where  transparent, beautiful lined up in the blocks. This mothership would  soon make big impact on the banking world, it would attack this old  school financial strongholds, and crush them just by being transparent,  decentralized, and more effective. Bitcoin did not need expensive  buildings in the city center or high paid managers with bonus.  

With only 21 million coins you had to hurry to get your share. The  price exploded.  Or as they like to say, it went to the moon. Big  profits where made. But the money attracted other forces. 2017 ended and  in early 2018 things went terribly wrong. The value was taken over by  speculation and  the price collapses.  


&gt;People and greed, history on repeat.   
 

In less than 8 months they forget why blockchain was  unique. Greed made us blind. We are about to forget the new alternative  against banking, bad goverments and corruption is  within our reach.  

With ETF they try to artificial pump the price back to the moon. But  they are selling there soils to the crypto devil. As soon as bitcoin is  just another asset on the stockmarked, it will lose its power and become  just another brick in the wall.  Do you remember what one of the main  causes of the financial crisis of 2008 was? To much not real existing  money was lent out by banks. This money was simply not backed up by real  value. Thats why we call it the 2008 credit crisis. With ETF we do the  same with bitcoin. Trading bitcoin without being covered with real  bitcoins. Bitcoin will become an asset controlled by other curranty. Not  a fair corruption proof independent curranty on its own.  21 million  coins will dilute as soon as ETF is confirmed, and on a longer term be  equal to 100 million coins. The price will drop (in my opinion) to the  gold standard or worse. And Bitcoin would be controlled by the big money  and the banks.  


&gt;This is an emergency call to the bitcoin community.   
 

Keep your coin pure. Do not contaminate it with other junk. Find a  way to break the power of the speculators. And be an example for a fair  world. 

Bitcoin is the queen bee in the crypto hyve. If you kill a queen bee  then the whole bee population will die. By giving the power back to the  banks we give up the unique element of blockchain… TRUST…With bitcoin  they can manipulate the crypto marked. ETF is a dark cloud on the  horizon.  

Ze hieven het glas en deden een plas en alles bleef zoals het was.

Combined my 2 hobbies.. Crypto and Crystals... thus cryptocrystals was born!,"Hey guys, I want to share my story on how I am contributing to the adoption of crypto. (It's small but it's something!

Recently I decided to combine my two biggest hobbies; Crypto and Crystals, thus the little venture Cryptocrystals was born. I sell semi-precious gemstones for display purposes around the house. Most of my customers are architects who try to brighten up their clients interior by adding some breathtaking specimens.

I accept almost any mainstream crypto up to any amount, this together with the name will be  my attempt to increase adoption of cryptocurrencies in general. My customers get a 15% discount if they pay in crypto, this should also help with the adoption.

If you want to check out my little venture look for Cryptocrystals on Instagram. I will do a free crystal give away to cryptoholders soon!!!

Also Im not sure if its allowed on here but im looking for people who can help me connect to high end crystal collectors or museums, I will pay them accordingly.

New to the crypto world,"Hi, I'm looking to learn more about crypto. I think I understand the basics about blockchain, the BTC white paper, etc.  What I'm interested in is more about the markets. Which exchange is best? Bitfinex seems like a solid option because of how they are one of the largest exchanges. Coinbase Pro has also peaked my interest. Where should I store my digital gold?

My friend told me about Tether and I would also like to learn more about that and how it affects Bitcoin trading. He basically said it is a way for exchanges to get around the icky regulations with fiat. I've also heard in the news that Tether could be rather sketchy and responsible for manipulating the Bitcoin price. Is there anything to worry about there?

I'm planning on sticking with Bitcoin only for now. Alt coins seem to be much riskier and less reputable projects that Bitcoin. 

Thanks in advance!",1535121633,24/08/2018 14:40:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/99xylg/new_to_the_crypto_world/,1

Accidentally sending BCH to a BTC wallet,"I didn’t think this could happen but I only use BTC. I posted a few min ago reaching out for help because a customer of mine sent me funds that took a long while to get. This is her first ever transfer using crypto so she’s brand spanking new. She sent me her screenshot of the transfer complete on her end and turns out she purchased BCH instead of BTC and sent to to the address I provided. I always use a legacy address, no real reasoning behind why I chose to send my legacy wallet info except for the other wallet addresses aren’t always compatible, the sender will say it won’t send or no such address so I’ve been receiving with a legacy address. I’m not a seasoned crypto guy by any means, I’m still learning myself, I’m not quite sure of the difference between a legacy route and default or compatible route. With that said, I was able to spend a little time on google and retrieve the transaction myself so if I can do it, anyone can! 
Customer: used coinbase to buy and send bitcoin cash
Me: provided my legacy address from Coinami

Here’s the link of the steps I took provided by coinami, it was super super easy. I did it all from my phone, no computer/laptop. Took all of 5 min, took more time to write down and type in my recovery phrase than getting the bitcoin cash into my BCH wallet. I went ahead and created anBCH wallet as soon as I noticed she sent cash and not coins. 

Good luck and I hope I was able to help someone out! Coinbase told her she was basically SOL so they aren’t any help.

"While r/BTC and r/Bitcoin fight amongst the general publics attention and money, none of them even give a shit about crypto","I've always kind of felt like whether Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash does well, it's good for crypto as a whole. I never really liked all the infighting, and honestly don't even really know enough to know who to side with.

For a long time people have said were all in crypto we should all support each other and want all coins to do well. This is true even more so now with crypto prices in the toilet and the vast majority of people not giving a shit about crypto.

I quit actively following crpto back in February for my mental health, but am still subscribed to r/btc/  r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency, but don't visit the subs so the only stuf I see is stuff that hits trending. The only articles or posts I ever wind up seeing is one side bitching about the other, rarely if ever do I see something that talks about the merit of eiher coin, developments in the communit, adoption. 

News flash guys, nobody (in the general public) gives a shit about either of your coins) come together or at least quit doing nothing but talking shit about each other, it doesn't interest most people and comes off as desperate.

Tax Question,"Okay, so I have to come clean on something, first. I bought my Bitcoin on Coinbase, and I'm ashamed to say I've left it there.

But I'm bought into the idea that everyone should control their own keys! You don't have to sell me on it, I get it, and I'm with you!

My only hesitation is this... Let's say hypothetically, the IRS (I'm a US citizen) wants to audit my Bitcoin transactions. How would they know that I'm not just moving stuff around so I can cash out without a trail back to my original purchase? In other words, they are looking for profit right? Doesn't shifting my holdings to another address sort of obfuscate the fact that I am just holding the whole time?

Can somebody help me think through it? I want to avoid causing a ""taxable event"" under US law, but at the same time, reserve my option to maybe one day trade back a portion for fiat and clearly show (for tax purposes) my buy points and sell points.

Am I worried about nothing at all?",1535138928,24/08/2018 19:28:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9a0eno/tax_question/,1

"There has been a lot of talk about a Bitcoin ETF. As a result, I've posted the following open letter addressed to the SEC.","Hello,

My name is Malcolm Rose and I run an educational website about cryptocurrencies. I'd like to talk for a moment about something that's been on all of our minds lately: the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF.

Hester Peirce is an SEC commissioner who has, unlike some of her colleagues, consistently expressed open minded and positive sentiments about cryptocurrency. When she posted [this tweet](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1027273379819204608) indicating that the SEC was open to receiving responses from the public regarding various questions it had about cryptocurrency, I knew that I had to do my part.

I have emailed the following [open letter](https://rosecrypto.com/Bitcoin-ETF-Open-Letter) and also [posted it on my website](https://rosecrypto.com/Bitcoin-ETF-Open-Letter). I don't know if they're going to bother reading it, but I am remaining optimistic; why else would they have asked for feedback from the public? In any event, if I can clear up any misinformation I will consider this to have been a worthwhile endeavor.

Please read my letter and let me know what you think. Signal boost this by tweeting about it or even writing your own letters. While I don't think a Bitcoin ETF is necessary for the success of Bitcoin, I do think it is of paramount importance to educate would-be regulators on these crucial topics.

Bitcoin's First 9 Months is it still relevant?,"These days (or years) do a quick search on the internet about 'bitcoin' what do we get? Always 'price' related news and info right? That is, price in terms of Fiat money we'd recognize. This is understandable as today we all live in a world where people are used to expressing and measuring 'value' in terms of Fiat money.  But there were times Bitcoin was not associated in any way with Fiat money right?  I mean before BTC became a tradable commodity. Yes I'm talking about the time before New Liberty Standard used a bunch of estimates and averages an did the calculation of BTC's exchange rate.  A few extra months would lapse before such rates became acceptable by anyone. The point is that there were about 9 months where technically there's people out there (Nakamoto and the early cypherpunks) and there's definitely tradable goods and services among these people and there's this new money thingy these folks all recognized and believed in (it's designed to function like money for God's sake). Now I'm just wondering what really went wrong? There's gifting of BTC (Nakamoto to Finney) but the use of BTC as medium of exchange for goods or services never happened.  Especially comparing to places and scenarios like a prehistoric tribe or some isolated community on some isolated island in the Pacific or one of the prisons or PoW camps where money and the use of money actually happened? What're the factors that made the differences? The prison/pow camp scenario would be more relevant as we're talking about recreation of money in a world where there's already money we'd all use and recognize.

I came up with the following explanations (which might or might not be relevant in designing of future crypto or crypto based systems):

i. Unlike the rather CLOSED OFF environment of prison or island or prehistoric societies we all live in an open world of Fiat money and have the CONVENIENCE to use it. Fortunately or unfortunately same would apply to the c punks. They'd just be using regular money to buy things.  

ii. Decentralized internet money such as BTC started off with LOOSELY CONNECTED (Nakamoto communicated with his penpals using a very primitive mailing list) and SPARSELY POPULATED early adopters from around the world. It's hard to trade things for real. Buyer seller connection was not there. 

iii. In isolated, tiny but well connected communities when it came to adoption of money DECISION MAKING would more likely be centralized, authoritarian, quick and arbitrary (I'd call it 'decreed agree'). 

iv. In such centralized settings one of the most frequently exchanged commodities whose VALUE could be most conveniently used to quantify the value of other commodities became the agreed (and/or decreed) commodity money within a community. And in the absence of Fiat money (island, tribe, or jail). These days we'd have two totally separate and different things or vehicles when it comes to the concept of value. One is company stock which is supposed to be a vehicle for growth and people agree and disagree on its value expressed in Fiat. The other is Fiat money itself that we'd all know and use as a medium of exchange for goods and services, which must have a relatively stable value or purchasing power.  

v. The size of ecosystem for such isolated and closed off community would be relatively STABLE in terms of  size of population, tradable goods and money supply. BTC was more or less an open system.

Calling all hodlers: please migrate to BCH; BTC has failed you,"Disclaimer: not trading advice. Not trolling; this post is heartfelt and sincere. I hope at least some people take it that way. I figure most people won't :(

BCH and BTC are both Bitcoin at a protocol level. So, this post isn't off-topic per the forum rules.

BTC is a failed chainfork of the Bitcoin blockchain. Promises of future virtue via LN et al are whisps of faith and hope delivered to your psyche by Twitter and other social media figureheads with the apparent agenda to merge the innovation of cryptocurrency with the vast, failing legacy system. Fiat 2.0. This is simply my observation of time passed, technology implemented, and events occurred. I'm not delving into conspiracy theories.

We need global cash. Without Bitcoin we fail as humanity. Literally, the banksters win, and continue to enslave us with debt **FOREVER**.

Isn't Bitcoin intended to **DEFEAT** them? Don't we *WANT** to defeat them?! Haven't they done enough to pillage and rape our wealth into **WORLDWIDE** hyperinflation?

Where's the Libertarian energy in this cryptospace? All I see is drama. I want **REAL-WORLD CHANGE**. In my opinion, BCH is the Bitcoin that is doing the most to try and make that happen. Disregarding all of the social hysteria surrounding it, at a protocol level, it can handle 32MB of transactions. Most computers and networks can handle this. A fraction of a percentage towards centralization is a decent tradeoff to have 32x BTC's current capacity.

""address"": ""bc1q48034a90t04j54mtsmtrcgk7vhfrhzsmcnt9s7"",   
""status"": ""confirmed""  
}, 

IF i fundchannel with BTCmainchain--&gt;LN btclcoked  as shown above it funds channel but I don't know

how much btc is left for funding.. or is it (total value of 'outputs' minus (sum of channels ..channel\_total\_sat)??

BITCOIN VS PAPER MONEY: THE TREND...episode 1,"Is there any doubt in your mind that currency will  all  soon be digital?   By that I mean you won’t be carrying cash with you anymore to pay for  goods and services. Your cash  will  all  be  digital and transferred through wires or over the air to another person.    It’s already happening. Simply link a credit card to your Apple account and enable your Apple Watch to pay with Apple Pay. With merchants that accept Apple Pay, you simply place your wrist with your Apple Watch near the payment sensor and within a couple of seconds the amount equivalent to the price of whatever you’re buying is debited to your credit card which you’ll settle at the end of the  month the usual way. If you don’t want to use Apple Pay, or don't have an Apple Watch, then either use Samsung Pay with a Samsung Watch or a Samsung smartphone and do the same thing. If you  don’t want to  link  your smartphone or smartwatch to your credit card, simply whip out your credit card  itself  and  wave  it  near  the merchant’s credit card terminal that shows the amount you need to pay.   If you hate credit cards because you don't like to borrow and pay interest and penalties for late settlement to your bank, then simply whip out your debit card to do the same thing.   Nowadays we’re also increasingly doing online bank transfers to one  another, with banks offering incentives for us to use this transfer method instead of checks, by making it cheaper to do things  online.    So there will come a day when we don’t need to ever handle cash anymore. This is getting to be the case more and more with each passing day. 

Whether you agree with me or not on this, the worst thing you can do is to be like Kodak.   Kodak was a giant in film products and film development services. It actually invented the first digital camera in 1976.   It had first mover advantage.  But it didn’t do anything with this capability, because  it  wanted to continue to sell films and film development services.    Kodak thought it was safe, even until the arrival of the most game-changing product in history. That product is the iPhone, which arrived in 2007.   The iPhone is also a digital camera, which replaces the need for anyone to get a separate camera with film. In fact, many people started using it more as a camera than as a phone.   Digital film is practically free. It costs  only a fraction of your battery power to shoot a single photo.   The Android smartphones that came after  the iPhone  further  eroded  Kodak’s market share  for film.   The switch to digital photography was swift.    Yet Kodak didn't take any action to create a digital film division for itself, despite seeing all the signs out there. It even refused to put its name on digital cameras.   In hindsight, Kodak probably wouldn’t have been able to  stop  the  huge smartphone  wave  anyway. But it could have at least tried.   It didn’t, because  Kodak was in  total and absolute denial  on what was happening  around  it.     

It filed for bankruptcy in 2012.   Now cryptocurrency  are  digital money.  They’re  very similar to the current paper money that’s in your bank account. Your  bank account shows you how much paper money you have deposited with them. If you want your  GBP  (Pounds Sterling)  to be in  USD  (US Dollars), simply go to a moneychanger and  exchange your GBP with his USD at the rate he has set. Great, now you have USD in  paper money form, which certain people in certain places accept, but other people in other places don't.   Now unless you like to keep cash under your pillow, you’ll put your USD into your bank account that can keep your USD for you. Once you’ve done that,  you can now see your USD in digital form, through a computer screen that shows your bank account with the amount of USD in it.   From now onwards you can transfer your USD to another with any of the above methods, without ever having to touch the paper  money equivalent again. So let’s now look at bitcoin or any cryptocurrency for that matter.   You can buy cryptocurrency with your  GBP. If you bought bitcoin with your GBP  -  great, you’ve just exchanged your  GBP  for bitcoin.   Exactly the same as how you  exchanged your  GBP  for USD. Certain people accept bitcoins for their goods, but not other people. Location is irrelevant here as bitcoin isn't created by any government, so everybody in the world can choose to accept it or otherwise.   Now bitcoin is digital in nature. 

It  REALLY  is  digital  in that  it doesn’t exist in any physical form, unlike your paper money. The difference is that you don’t store bitcoin with any bank, but in your own e-wallet on your computer,  or  in your hardware wallet (which looks like a USB drive). You still see numbers in your e-wallet that show  you how many bitcoins you have, like your bank account displays  numbers that show you how much paper money you have. And so this cryptocurrency e-wallet is the equivalent of your paper money bank account, as both display  numbers for you to know how much you have.   So up to this point, there really isn't much of a difference between paper money stored in a bank, and paper money stored in bitcoin that is displayed in your e-wallet.   However,  there is a huge difference that impacts us greatly.   Because there is a  limited  supply of bitcoin  (only  21 million  bitcoins will ever be created  –  this is part of bitcoin’s code), compared to paper money which has no limit (governments issuing their paper currencies  don’t  limit their supply),  your bitcoin’s value can go up over time if more and more people want to use bitcoin to  send money to each other, while your paper money’s value will go down over time as the government of the day can print more and  more of it to suit their objectives. But nobody uses bitcoin or cryptocurrency to transact with each other, you say. Really?   

1.  A batch of 50 Dubai luxury flats offered for sale in bitcoin have all been snapped up. These luxury flats (or condominiums,  as  others would call it) cost between USD130,000 to USD380,000 each. Buyers of those 50 flats paid between 15 to 45 bitcoins for each flat, which were equivalent to the USD prices at that time. Source:  http://uk.businessinsider.com/50-dubai-luxury-flats-sold-for-bitcoinand-one-buyer-bought-10-2018-2/.   

2.  A Singaporean paid for his holidays in Australia with cryptocurrency only.   He  had  left  all his cash and credit cards behind.   He paid for his flights, airport transfers, hotel, meals, entertainment and  rides around the city all with bitcoin or other cryptocurrency as applicable.

3.  KFC, Microsoft accepts bitcoin as payments In KFC’s  case, for their “Bitcoin Bucket”: https://www.ccn.com/the-bitcoin-bucket-kfc-canada-accepts-bitcoin-for-friedchicken/   In Microsoft’s case, for purchasing content in their Windows and Xbox stores: https://www.ccn.com/microsoft-reboots-bitcoin-payments-ensuring-lowamounts-redeemable/   4.  The list of establishments accepting bitcoin as payment grows every single day: See  https://www.ccn.com/accepts-bitcoin/   

You can find big  accounting firms  accepting bitcoins as payment. And people are even  making  donations to politicians with bitcoins.   So if you hear someone say that bitcoin or other cryptocurrency are not ""currency"", check to see who is saying it.  He’s  usually from a government, bank, or  have a  traditional investment background  or  similar. They're ignoring the facts, and insist their view is true, when exactly the opposite is happening. Just  like  Kodak.   But at least Kodak was in denial. The others above are simply protecting their own interests, by doing their best to create as much  FUD  (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) as possible on something that directly impacts their profits.   

I’ll talk more about FUD in  episode  5. And so, at this stage, you have 3 choices: 

1.  Trust the ""authorities"" to tell you what  it is and  how to deal with cryptocurrency, and follow their  instructions  exactly  –  which is usually to ignore it or not use it.   

2.  Be in denial and sit out  what appears to be  the greatest opportunity to have come along in a long, long while.   

3.  Embrace the revolution that is happening right before your very eyes and under your very nose by testing it with small amounts of money  that won't cause you much damage if you lose them all,  with huge potential  ROIs  that can go into the  thousands of percent  in a few years,  faster  than any other type of investment that has come before it.

Multi-platform Hedging Stabilization Arbitrage V2.1 (Annotation Edition)," 

The hedging strategy is a relatively risky and stable type of strategy. Hedging is to achieve the profit by trading in the different markets at the same time, “moving” the currency to the exchange with low price and “flowing” the money to the exchange with high price.

**Program logic flow**

&amp;#x200B;

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/p8x2ev00w6i11.png)

 

**Strategic interpretation**

This strategy can achieve hedging transactions on multiple digital currency spot platforms with simple code and basic hedging capabilities. Since this version is the basic teaching version, the space for optimization is large. For the new users and new developers who are learning strategy writing, it can provide a good example and some skills. It is very helpful to master the techniques of quantitative strategy writing.

The strategy can be put in real market, but because it is the most basic version of teaching, the scalability is still very large, and students who have mastered the idea can also try to reconstruct the strategy.

I explained bitcoin to a smart kid and he asked me some difficult questions,"I was recently explaining bitcoin and blockchain to a kid - he’s a smart one and he asked me:

1. Who is creating the mathematical tasks for the miner computers to solve?

2. If they get more and more complex and difficult to solve, how are they being created in the first place? Are they already implemented in the code?

3. If it’s possible to upgrade the bitcoin protocol to improve it, is it not also possible then to change the rules? For example to remove the limit that there will only be ever 21million mines bitcoins? 

I couldn’t answer these questions- anyone?",1535181914,25/08/2018 07:25:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9a52xo/i_explained_bitcoin_to_a_smart_kid_and_he_asked/,1

True story: @brian_armstrong (Coinbase CEO) just can’t bring himself to say the word “bitcoin”. He just deleted the tweet in the screenshot to replace “bitcoin” with “crypto”,,1535183197,25/08/2018 07:46:37,https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1033054959330369536,1
Satoshi's Vision - Its a construct,"Just thought I’d put forward my own opinion about what I believe Satoshi’s Vision is, create some food for thought.

To start with I’d like to make these two rather bold but factual statements:

**Satoshi’s Vision is a construct**

**Satoshi’s Vision does not exist**

Now I'll explain. The Bitcoin white-paper is a technical brief or a how-it-works, it does not describe a vision and the word vision is no where to be found within the white-paper. 

Satoshi did not outline a grand vision, there was no philosophy. His dialogue was mature, practical and to the point.

However we continue to hear about Satoshi Vision’s. So where did this nonsense about Satoshi’s Vision come from?

I searched the internet and filtered the results by using the search-by-date function.

What I found was Satoshi’s Vision popped up around the time the scaling debate was raging. 

What people seemed to be doing and are still doing, is using this term ‘Satoshi’s Vision’ to endear others to ‘their viewpoint’ about scaling and protocol change.

At the extreme end it is being used as a propaganda tool, to coerce and further divide our community to form two distinct sides, the right and the wrong, naturally Bitcoin developers and users are on the wrong side, according to them.

Disagreements over scaling Bitcoin, Segwit and Lightning are just that, they have nothing to do with Satoshi’s Vision because Satoshi did not describe his vision in the white-paper.

Folks please don’t be fooled by this Satoshi’s Vision nonsense, think for yourselves. Take the time to read Satoshi’s emails and forums posts, you will soon come to understand that Satoshi created the basic protocol and wanted us all to contribute, to debug and write the code.. to improve upon what he created. Its up to us now to mould Bitcoin into what it needs to be to face the future challenges. 

Satoshi was a brilliant systems integrator, an architect and a not too shabby C++ programmer. Almost all of the economic, incentive and engineering principles were actually created before Bitcoin. Even the blockchain idea was thought of a decade before Bitcoin. But Satoshi put all of those individual principles into one brilliant package and with the help of ‘us’ together we made it work and it continues to work. Bitcoin is as much ours as it is Satoshi’s, we as a community develop it and if someone doesn’t like it, they can fork Bitcoin and compete on fair terms.

Fair terms means not using propaganda to brainwash the crypto-community, not trying to hijack Bitcoins ticker and name, not being corrupt and fraudulent in their representations and actions. Not using emotive constructs like 'Satoshi's Vision' as a propaganda tool.",1535183585,25/08/2018 07:53:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9a574x/satoshis_vision_its_a_construct/,1

Earn millions every month from easy working,"Earn with CrowdIF

&amp;#x200B;

How can YOU profit from the CrowdIF platform. There are more ways than just one!

&amp;#x200B;

The company has launched the first version of our working product - The SentimentScore Platform v1.0

&amp;#x200B;

SentimentScore v1.0 is not an MVP, it's not even a beta product. It's much more than both! It's a full fledged version 1 of a fully functional product. This is quite different from all other ICOs where users generally have to wait for ages just to see an MVP and a lot of times, even that's not available.

&amp;#x200B;

The SentimentScore platform is a very powerful for two reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The technology behind the platform and the accuracy of price movement predictions that it can make.

2. The immense profit potential that the platform opens up not just for the company, but most importantly for all CrowdIF-ires, that's all of YOU!

&amp;#x200B;

These profits are not for the company alone. All CrowdIF-ires will be able to participate in programs which will allow them to earn tremendous profits.

&amp;#x200B;

In simplest terms, the predictions of SentimentScore are become better with the quality and quantity of the data that we can analyze. To gather this data, we scour various sources on the internet but our biggest strength is the data that we get from human sources. For this purpose, we run the CrowdIF Collective Intelligence Program (The C-CIP). This is one of its kind initiative which is aimed at pooling the Collective Intelligence of Crowd and using it to predict the market sentiment and hence the direction of the market. It's the first time that anyone is doing something like this in the crypto industry.

&amp;#x200B;

You can participate in C-CIP through a 100 USD participation fee (paid in BTC/ETH or CIF tokens). This is to ensure that only serious candidates apply. Keeping the participation free or open makes it vulnerable to spamming and abuse. Once you become a participant, you become eligible for a ton of options from where you can earn insane profits.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you a better idea, here's a list of all the ways in which YOU too can earn through the CrowdIF platform:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Referral Profit

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest power of CrowdIF platform is, of course the CROWD! The more people use the platform, the more intelligent it becomes. The most effective method of making something viral is the word of mouth. Keeping this in mind, we will be running a referral program with possibility to make awesome profits. For every person that joins the C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program) using your referral link or the referral link of anyone in your team, you get a referral benefit. You will receive amazing 'Referral Profits' for bringing more users to the platform. It's easy to do. All you need to do is to share your referral link on your social media and other places on the internet. Here's the benefit structure:

&amp;#x200B;

Layer/Level-1 (Your immediate referrals): 10 USD

Layer-2: 5 USD

Layer-3: 4USD

Layer-4: 3USD

Layer-5: 2 USD

&amp;#x200B;

2. Intelligence Profit

&amp;#x200B;

High quality and quantity of data is the key to the best analysis. You can help CrowdIF in our data aggregation efforts and when you do so, you open another profit stream - the 'Intelligence Profit'!

&amp;#x200B;

To earn the intelligence profit, you have to participate in the C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program). As a part of this program, you can answer some questionnaires about cryptocurrency that will appear on your user dashboard from time to time. Answering the questionnaire to the best of your ability will make you eligible for intelligence profit. As a C-CIP participant, you may expect around 10 questionnaires per month and a payout of minimum 2 to 4 USD per questionnaire.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Portfolio Profit

&amp;#x200B;

Using the intelligence gathered by through the C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program), the company predicts crypto price movements and trades all across global exchanges based upon these insights to earn profits.

&amp;#x200B;

As a company, we have decided to let our users take advantage of our technology as well. After all, it's our users who give us our superpower by sharing their intelligence with us. CrowdIF can manage your trading portfolio using its revolutionary price prediction platform, for you too. You get minimum 25% return every month in the form of 'Portfolio Profit'. All you need to do is to participate in C-PIP (CrowdIF - Portfolio Income Program).

&amp;#x200B;

4. Portfolio Referral Profit

&amp;#x200B;

When users in your team build their own portfolios, they start receiving their own Portfolio's profit and on YOU receive another referral benefit as a percentage of THEIR portfolio profits.

&amp;#x200B;

For all the Portfolio Profit generated anywhere in your layer-1 team, you receive a 25% Portfolio Referral Profit (PRP). For example if a person in your layer-1 team earns 100 USD Portfolio Profit on his investment, you automatically get 25 USD Portfolio Referral Profit (PRP).

&amp;#x200B;

5. Distributed Mining Profits

&amp;#x200B;

CrowdIF will also allow you to rent out your surplus CPU power on your computer and mobile phones when you're not using it to generate more profits through distributed mining of cryptocurrencies. All you need to do is to become a free user at CrowdIF and just keep a webpage open in your browser on your computer or mobile phone. Till the time this webpage is open on your device, it will use the processor for distributed cryptocurrency mining and a part of the profits will be shared with you in the form of Distributed Mining Profits (DMP). You don't need to install any special software on your computer to benefit from this program.

&amp;#x200B;

The general terms for referral profit are:

&amp;#x200B;

You would be eligible for referral income only if you're a participant of the C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program).

You get a referral benefit for only for users under you (till layer-5) who are participants of C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program).

You will get the benefit instantly as soon as any of your team member becomes a C-CIP participant.

If you yourself are not a C-CIP participant and anyone in your team becomes a participant, you will not get benefit for that and it will get lapsed.

Remember as per point 1, you have to be a C-CIP participant yourself to get this benefit.

One person can participate in the program only once. If one person is found to have multiple accounts, those accounts may be banned.

&amp;#x200B;

The general terms for intelligence profit are:

&amp;#x200B;

You become eligible to receive questionnaires as soon as you become a participant of the C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program).

You will receive 2 or more questionnaires every week.

All questionnaires received in a week will need to be answered before Sunday midnight UTC. After this, the week's questionnaires will be disabled and you will not be able to answer or earn from them.

&amp;#x200B;

The general terms for C-PIP (CrowdIF - Portfolio Income Program) are:

&amp;#x200B;

You can start your portfolio with a minimum of 250 USD.

Within 3 days of your initiation, your funds will be allocated to our trading portfolio. Thereafter, you'll start receiving a daily Portfolio Profit on this amount.

There is NO LOCK IN PERIOD on this fund. You can put in a Request of Release (RoR) at any time and your fund will be deallocated from the fund and returned to you within a week of your request.

As soon as you put in a Request of Release (RoR), your daily Portfolio Profit will stop.

In case you wish to cancel your Request of Release (RoR), you may do so any time before your fund release process has been completed. In this case, you will start receiving the Portfolio Profit from the next day onwards.

You can build a portfolio even without participating in C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program). In this case, you will not need to answer questionnaires and you will not be eligible for Intelligence Profit or Referral Profit.

&amp;#x200B;

The general terms for portfolio profit are:

&amp;#x200B;

Your PRP will be equal to 25% of all the Portfolio Profit generated anywhere in the layer-1 of your team.

To be eligible for PRP, you need to have an active investment portfolio yourself.

PRP does not apply to users in your team beyond layer-1.

PRP will be credited in your account instantly at the same time the daily Portfolio Income is credited.

&amp;#x200B;

The general terms for distributed mining profit are:

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need a paid account for this income. You don't need to participate in C-CIP (CrowdIF - Collective Intelligence Program) or C-PIP (CrowdIF - Portfolio Income Program) to be eligible for Distributed Mining Profits.

Your weekly DMP will be credited to your account at the end of every week (on Sunday 12 midnight UTC)

The amount of your income will depend upon the processing power you dedicate for distributed mining. If you prefer, you can run your account on multiple devices simultaneously to increase your income.

You will need to keep our DMP webpage open in your browser to benefit from this program.",1535188253,25/08/2018 09:10:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9a5j0e/earn_millions_every_month_from_easy_working/,1

How is the OneTime Payment system making it Easier and Cheaper to transfer money annonymously to other users.,"The OneTime payments system is a feature embedded within the platform that allows users to send Bitcoins across the Application. All OneTime Payments are sent within the app between 2 users.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes the OneTime payments feature unique from other Platforms for example Coinbase is that the user sending the funds (Bitcoins) doesnt require the need to see your personal wallet address. Therefore the User only needs to be within your followers group in order to Use your Username to make a Payment. In order to make a transaction succesful you must input your Bitcoin wallet Pin to send. After all this the receiver will have the credit balanced in his or her account Instantly and availabe to withdraw when they please.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why would you use the OneTime payment if its free on other Platforms to send Bitcoins within the site or app?** 

&amp;#x200B;

The OneTime Payments feature has a fixed fee at 1% accros all Transactions Large or Small. Within this 1% fee we provide full Support in making sure everything is smooth as it can be, we also provide the ability for even first time users to find it extra easy to send Bitcoin payments to there family or friends. No need to see or use a wallet address, this can look scary to first time users of Bitcoin or dont really know what they're doing. Simple easy and Smooth to function, simply enter the username, then amount you wish to send and lastly the Wallet pin then finished! Can be done within 30 seconds! The receiver will see the amount credited to there balance Instantly! and availabe to withdraw striaght away!

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you used a Platform for example LocalBitcoins to send a Transaction to a family member or a loved one, firstly you will need to know the Users wallet address, now this can look scary to new users or first time users of Bitcoin. After receiving the wallet address from the User who you wish to send the funds to, then you must make sure every letter in the address is correct (Between 26-35 digits) and again can be scary sending large amount of money for a first time user. After all this you must calculate the amount you wish to send converted into Bitcoin, Not good if you cant Calculate correcty, you wouldnt want to send more! after all this and making double sure everything was correct and 10 Minutes later you click Send! The transaction will be broadcasted on the BlockChain. After all this and you mess up the wallet address you will lose all your Bitcoins! No Transaction is irreversable once you click send!

&amp;#x200B;

With the OneTime payments feature no transaction can be Incorrect! You must be within the Users following list to send a Payment. 

1) Enter Username (App finds User) No need for a Wallet Address!

2) Enter Amount

3) Enter Wallet Pin and SEND!

Bitcoin is only useful for 1 thing,"If you manage to get it at low prices, such as 00.01 dollars, you can sacrifice $100 and get 10,000 coins.

Next you wait and try to Pump interest, by writing fables of how it's going to a trillion next week because it contains block chains and muh ledger.

If you are lucky, a sufficient number of dumb kids will bid the price to $1000 at which point you sell and walk away with 100 million dollars.

Now I'm reading all this stuff about currency exchange, $10m clubs ect....

Soo what have I really gotten myself into?? Are my bit coins really worth anything?? I read today that they are actually doing pretty bad compared to previous years. Does this mean I picked the wrong time to invest. How do I know the true worth of my currency and monitor the fluctuation so I know when to sell or hold on to it?

I know 5 dollars isn't a lot to invest but I'm cheap and want to hold on to every dime I gain. Plus I'm worried If i invest too much it would be a waist.

Why bitcoin lovers need OneTime app for their business?,"Bitcoin with its emergence brought a new layer of innovation in technology and business. With its huge acceptance, came a lot of platforms dealing with Bitcoin’s business, one out of which is the OneTime app. Unlike others, the newly built app is an evidence of the clever technology integrating social media, online marketplace and trading bitcoins, all at a single locale. The software eradicates boredom of a person while the sale-purchase of products/bitcoins keeping him simultaneously active over a  social channel. 

A perfect collaboration of fun and entertainment with an online business is truly one of its kind. It is something never witnessed before and can be enjoyed only by trying it once. OneTime has a lot for the Bitcoin lovers benefiting them with all the extensive security features built in the app. To mention, the Escrow System, PGP(Pretty Good Privacy) encryption, Bitcoin Pin, Two-way Authentication are the main assets dealing a users privacy keeping the personal information a secret at the forefront. Other internal traits like Shoutout, Bitcoin payment/exchange, OneTime posts, Real-time messaging add value to the app giving a user, better experience and a worth to use.

OneTime will definitely give you whatever is proposed by it on satisfactory grounds. Have a look at the below-mentioned feature which will give you a clear picture of things offered by the app

**Guarded Payments**

The business done on the all-in-one platform is safe and one can rely upon the embedded security systems- PGP and two-factor authentication. The transfer of Bitcoins and remittance is overseen by these, where the messages sent in real-time mode are hard to decipher with strong encryptions. And, along with the login and password, there is one another asset(a one time password) required to identify your credentials while signing in. Protected with such high-level layers one can praise the security system of OneTime built for user comfort.

**Bitcoin Escrow**

Escrow, the mediator, clears the doubts and risks of send/receive payments while trading. Escrow service is fully reliable when it comes to sell the products or exchange your Bitcoins. Being happy with the purchase, the buyer allows Escrow to release the funds using their unique Bitcoin Pin so that the seller can receive the same on his end. In case of occurrence of any conflict, the Support System is there to freeze the digital currency unless the dispute gets resolved. Upon the obligations to be fulfilled, the funds are released or refunded depending upon the situation, thereby assuring the safety of the Bitcoins on both sides. In OneTime, the person is kept way far from scammers and frauds.

**Extra Enjoyable Features**

Apart from business, OneTime delivers some relaxing features to be enjoyed. After getting free from your scheduling hours, you can start socializing over the app with real-time instant texting and connect with the loved ones, anytime and from any corner of the world. Chat, Buy, Sell, Shoutout- are all the new features to experiment and do fun with the connected ones. OneTime simply aims to bring all the people under one roof be it friends, vendors or investors, without keeping space for barriers. An individual without a doubt can reap all the benefits without extra efforts.

**Bitcoin Pin**

Bitcoin pin can be related to a key of a lock without which you won’t be able to unlock your account and move forward. Your pin is a unique identification enabling you to tackle everything in OneTime, especially your payments and transfers of Bitcoins. Besides, PGP and Escrow proving you the internal security, Bitcoin pin safeguards you externally.

**OneTime Payments**

We know that the cryptocurrency phenomenon is totally decentralized without involving any arbitrator or third party involved. Therefore, once depositing your Bitcoins in the OneTime wallet, your contracts, dealings, and transactions are firmly tackled with the strong inbuilt codes and protective layers. The process involves Bitcoin Addresses for exchanging your virtual currency.  This is how independent and transparent things are kept in the software implementing the revolutionary concepts of science and technology.

All the above aspects will come to practice once you install the app and sail through it. The mission is to be in touch with the global audience, gaining and selling Bitcoins while doing fun at the same place via this multi-purpose OneTime App.

The long wait to 2021.,"I’m not convinced in this notion that the crypto market is traveling “faster than ever.” No I think it’s just as slow as it’s ever been. It actually was traveling faster than ever between 2011 to 2013. Since then, it had 3 really slow years followed by a very prolific 2017 where everyone hopped on the bandwagon. And then as normal, this was followed by several immediate up-and-down spikes as seen with other major rises in BTC history. I don’t suspect any major activity until 2021 or until an ETF gets passed which I can’t see until after 2021. I predict 3 years of stale Bitcoin activity where it fails in being adopted by the mainstream, yet several annoying memes of people claiming they saw a BTC symbol in some obscure place on a bench in a New York City park that nobody goes to... or their little hip neighborhood pizza cafe allowed to buy one slice in BTC. This is where we are with Bitcoin, still in the obscure phase where most people in the world still haven’t heard of BTC. I mean...imagine if some douche went around and bragged about buying a slice of pizza with USD cash... People would look at him weird. But when it happens with BTC, the Bitcoin community rejoices as if it’s a sign of something epic. No, it’s not. And that’s exactly my point with where we are with BTC. The SEC laughs at Bitcoin ETFs as something like Monopoly money. They don’t respect cryptocurrency because no major financial institutions back it in 2018. That is the fact. You can disagree with objectivity or you can be patient and understand that reward comes to those who can wait. Unfortunately, most people don’t want to.",1535235488,25/08/2018 22:18:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9aaods/the_long_wait_to_2021/,1

I need your help to bring my dad away of BCH,"Good day Reddit!

My dad got fascinated by cryptocurrencies; that's good.

He wants to invest in it so bought BCH; that's bad.

He also wants to HODL this piece of crap.

I mean you HODL BTC and Exchange BCH to BTC.

He told me that he has a deeper knowledge about finance and prices than me (I think he got confused by the ""bump"" in Aug '17 of BCH).

I already told him that his money will be gone and BCH is the biggest scam on this planet but he won't believe me.

Could you help me and writing him an E-Mail with arguments that he should exchange all his BCH to BTC and BCH is a bad thing?

I think when he check his E-Mails and see around 50 new E-Mails were is written that BCH is a bad thing he would probably change his opinion about it,

"Philosophical, ethical, legal question","I recently discovered the concept of brain wallet guessing (don't want to call it hacking because of the questions I'm posing)

I found a bunch of forum posts and people online saying its despicable and wrong to ""steal"" from brain wallets after getting the private key.

I'm really curious about the reasoning behind these people so vehemently attacking brain wallet bot creators so my questions for those people or anyone else:

-----
1) If I guess an obscure phrase and it happens to have BTC at the address already and I created the private key by my own calculation, why is the BTC not mine?  People argue that it's like finding a wallet (I personally disagree, but that's why I pose question 2)

2) If I create a trillion brain wallets that have 0 balance based on obscure phrases, and some years down the line someone happens to think of the same phrase, make a wallet, and put BTC into it.  Does this now become my money?  For hose that argue for question (1) behind like finding a wallet, then in this scenario wouldn't it be like someone pick pocketing my empty wallet and then putting money in it for me? 
***
(I think in many cases the brain wallet bots are doing this, they take the money out as soon as it hits the wallet, which means they had the private key all along.  I think if you argue for (1) being wrong then you should submit that the wallet is essentially the bot creators wallet if they had the private key first. )

3) If you think taking the money in (2) is ok, but (1) is not ok.  What is the logic behind this?  Is BTC address creation now a first come first server thing... ethically?  I don't there is any legal implication in either case if you genuinely just guessed their private key of your own accord.

4) If you think taking the money in (1) and (2) is not ok.  Why?
I could understand a business giving back the correct change when someone grossly over-pays, but bitcoin addresses held by individuals and transactions that are 'anonymous' and cannot be retracted are a little different right?

5) Any other information you would like to provide in why finding money in a brain wallet should be philosophically, ethically, or legally 'wrong'.

Bitcoin is driven by US. Put that in your brain.,"Bitcoin is driven by us. Converting BTC to FIAT is the biggest mistake we do, we all do, at least most of us do. Bitcoin is a currency, we need to spend it, like we spend fiat we need to spend bitcoin too. I know, not everyone accepts bitcoin now. At least for now...  


If we give newcomers they idea that you join bitcoin so you can sell higher and earn more fiat and to be rich then its WRONG, FULLY WRONG. In order to drive bitcoin around we need to spend it around BUT NOT convert it into fiat. As long as we show that we still need FIAT governments will never stop talking sh!t.

I am currently a BCH supporter with an open mind, and I have a question for the BTC community.

If Lightening Network or other types of off-chain scaling solutions were to fail, would you then switch to BCH or find a good reason to continue to hold onto BTC?

What I am trying to figure is how much of the Bitcoin future actually relies on LN or other similar solutions.

"Venezuela update: After knocking off five zeroes, one BTC is trading at BsS. 550,000. In the last 24h 56 BTC were trading in LocalBitcoin. That gives a exchange rate of 81.5 BsS./USD, which is higher that the new rate set by the goverment of 60.25 BsS./USD.","By the way, CoinDance still doesn't work because they haven't updated the new iso code of the new currency (It was VEF now it is VES).

I used www.dolarbeta.com bot to get that info (i think the creator is a redditor).

If they allow the ""free"" exchange of crytos here (looks like they want to), they will set the price of the cryptos. For example, the exchange rate they use is 60.25 BsS. / USD. Using the price of 6,600 USD/BTC.  that  gives us  397.650 BsS./BTC. But at localbitcoin it's trading much higher (at least 25% more). They insist in controlling the prices OF EVERYTHING even the crypto.

Inflation keeps rising, even the government had to increase some prices like public transportation (they increases are from 0.002 BsS. to 0.5 BsS. and even more.

I'm a bit worried because for now the gasoline is free, but.. Soon they will increase the price to ""international levels"", so around 0.6 USD per litre maybe.. I won't be able of using my car (Remember, starting next week new minimum wage per month will be 30 USD). 

They want all the people to register in a system called ""Carnet de la patria"", if you do so, you can receive some kind of subside to buy gasoline. I don't want to register because I think it's a method of political control.",1535292731,26/08/2018 14:12:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9afsr3/venezuela_update_after_knocking_off_five_zeroes/,1

lightning network setup problems (please help a noob!),"I installed a btc full node a while back on a vps. I wanted to setup lightning network on it so I followed this tutorial:

&amp;#x200B;

everything went well up until the point where I generated my lightning wallet seed, which i was able to do. When I attempt to unlock the wallet using the 'lncli unlock' command,  and the wallet unlocks, but then instantly disconnects, and I get the following error message:  


2018-08-26 14:15:13.313 \[INF\] LNWL: Opened wallet

&amp;#x200B;

In the tutorial I saw this but don't know how to do what it says and assign a port to zmq:  


Note: as of github master from 2018-08-10 onwards you need different  ports for each zmq config option, and no longer use bitcoind.zmqpath  option.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please give me a noob friendly push in the right direction to resolve the connectivity issue I am having so I can buy some friggin blockstream stickers?

Obituaries from 99bitcoins,"There's been a lot of those over the years. So when the price (that is, expressed in money we'd understand and recognize) goes down and goes way down it is dead or dying? And when its price goes back up and up and up then it's haha not dead? What's BTC's end goal here? Assuming it's going to be a 'success' which means price will keep going up over the years. Is this end goal going to be measurable and recognizable only in terms of Fiat money? Let's try imagine one day 1BTC equals 1 with as many 0s of your local money as imaginable. If that ever happens all I can say is it sounds like your local money is going Zimbabwe. Right? Can you imagine all local money going Zimbabwe? Can you really?  Ok maybe imagine aliens land and forbid all govs on earth from printing Fiat because they want to give BTC a chance to be used by humans. Then how are you going to measure and agree on the value of BTC? The value or purchasing power of any real money should be expressed and expressible in terms of real goods and real services. And will have to be relatively stable.  Can you imagine accepting AND spending your BTC for real goods and services in real world if the 'prices' keep going up and up? Accepting yes, spending haha no because I'll just hodl.",1535307528,26/08/2018 18:18:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9aho6v/obituaries_from_99bitcoins/,1

Some tips for people who are interested in running a bitcoin full node and lightning node (also on IPv6),"Hey, I just managed to get my first raspberry pi lightning node online and working on mainnet: [https://1ml.com/node/02cb72d6aebc1c29e7e8e3066bdc01e4608b39968b8054307387424aeebe3a25c6](https://1ml.com/node/02cb72d6aebc1c29e7e8e3066bdc01e4608b39968b8054307387424aeebe3a25c6) Also, I'm the first person in my city to run a bitcoin full node, which is a great feeling. If you want to do this as well, I can recommend you this guide:

[https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/blob/master/raspibolt/README.md](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/blob/master/raspibolt/README.md)

It is very newbie-friendly and explains everything in detail.

The only thing for me to do that is not explained in this guide was setting up the node with IPv6 because my ISP only allows me to have an IPv6 home network. The thing you want to be careful about is the firewall. If you're in the same situation I can recommend you those links:

[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix\_commands/ip6tables.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/ip6tables.htm)

[http://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/IPv6-Tables/(offset)/6](http://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/IPv6-Tables/(offset)/6)

Also, you're gonna have to disable ""onlynet=ipv4"" (put a # before the line) in bitcoin.conf.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lessons learned/tips:** Lots of guides tell you to to download the whole blockchain directly on your raspberry pi. This can take several weeks, which is quite unacceptable in most situations. The guide i mentioned before does this in a better way: You just download the blockchain using a regular personal computer with more computing power and transfer it over to your raspberry pi over your home network. It took me two days, which was okay for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cost:** My cost for the hardware was about 150$ because I bought everything from scratch and also got a quite large external HDD to store the blockchain on (future-proof). The raspberry pi and external hdd don't waste much energy and the running cost is very small. But I recommend to do this only if you have an unlimited upload bandwidth.

social attack vector blessing,"I was thinking that in a sense it's a blessing that social attack vectors from bad actors like r.ver and csw have already been deployed.

Bitcoin has adapted and grown more resilient and this makes the probability of using such attacks in the future less likely or if they are used - way less likely to succeed since the community is more aware of how such attacks operate.

can you imagine how much more damaging a hard fork would be 5 years from now or if a figure like csw emerged a few years from and claimed to be satoshi nakamoto and how much more of an impact it would have on bitcoin in global adoption environment? 

I'm not greatful to those guys personally - but I am greatful that such attack vectors have already been exhausted and triumphed over.",1535311536,26/08/2018 19:25:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ai7ic/social_attack_vector_blessing/,1

"""Bitcoin is the only medium guaranteed to not be debased, no matter how much its value rises."" -- Saifedean Ammous","&gt;For most of human history, some physical object was used as the store of value. The function of value storage did not need a physical manifestation, but having one allowed for making the supply of the store of value harder to increase. Bitcoin, by not having any physical presence, and being purely digital, is able to achieve strict scarcity. No divisible and transportable physical material had ever achieved this before. Bitcoin allows humans to transport value digitally without any dependence on the physical world, which allows large transfers of sums across the world to be completed in minutes. The strict digital scarcity of the Bitcoin tokens combines the best elements of physical monetary media, without any of the physical drawbacks to moving and transporting it. **Bitcoin** might have a claim to make for being the **best technology for saving ever invented**.

Relatively new to crypto. The drama between BTC and BCH.,"This feels like a divide and conquer tactic that the people in control use to keep control. Order out of chaos.

They do it with blacks vs whites, atheists for religious, left vs right, red vs blue. They make you choose a side and now you are easier to control and manipulate.

That said... Can someone explain to me how this all started and where they think this is all going in a collegiate manner. Meaning no name calling or troll like responses.

What benefits does one coin have over the other?

Does BTC have a scaling and high fee issue that isn't being addressed?

Has big money infiltrated BTC discussions forums as well as the github? ( I've seen this done in many political forums to shut down opposing viewpoints. )

If someone could give me the low down on what they believe is going on.

1.	Thy shall holdth thy private keys, and let no other holdth for the !

2.	Thy shall not be tempted by another coin !

3.	Thy shall not invest more than thy can lose !

4.	Thy shall stay Anonymous in the eyes of thy Network !

5.	Thy shall praise Bitcoin onto others, as others praised Bitcoin on to the !

6.	Thy shall pray to Cyber Security with all thy heart and thy might !

7.	Thy shall HODLth with all thy strength in the midst of darker times !

8.	Thy shall buy only in thy Dip !

9.	Thy shall ignore FUD and FOMO, but stay connected with thy revolution !

10.	Thy shall not claim where thy ""Price"" will be in the future, for only God knows !

When cometh the war against ""Fiat"", I shall call on my wrath to each and all, big and small, rich and poor, freeman and slave, first and last. To those who followed these commandments and enrichth the in thy new light, remember from where thou has fallen ! For on the new day of crypto, ye shall be called to share with loved one.

"selling 20,000 bitcoin all at once","just fantasising, say back in 2016 i bought £9,000,000 ( 9 million) worth of bitcoin. price was roughly 400-500 at the time.

then i wanted to sell them all in 2017, when the price was 14,000. this means id have £280,000,000 (280 million) worth of bit coin.

i know apparently selling all at once can cause a market crash.. ive never had bitcoin so dont know how it works, would this market crash affect me? or just other people after ive sold them? 

what would be the best way for me to quickly sell all my bitcoin while the price was high, without causing a crash in the market and affecting myself and losing money for myself?

can i not sell them instantly all at one go somewhere, for the current market price, so any crash in the market wouldn't affect me because ive already sold all mine",1535347104,27/08/2018 05:18:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9amak8/selling_20000_bitcoin_all_at_once/,1
Bitcoin Traders are Stoooopid and smart money is not here yet.,"Fed banker Powell makes hugely dovish remarks that show they are unwilling to rein in the debt and live up to their word to 'tighten'.

This means the dollar has topped out, So gold bounces hard Friday 'like it should', where the smart money is but the stupid bitcoin traders are trading off of charts and etf rumors. LOLOL If smart money were in bitcoin it would have spiked up $1k to $2k minimum.

Forget etf and any other crap the real NUMBER ONE USE CASE of bitcoin will be to hedge against this ALREADY EXISTING DEBT CRISIS.
I just wonder why people are so blind.  Bunch of clowns spouting charts all day which is simply the HISTORY of price movement. 
Even hedge fund managers spouting this and that have no understanding of FUNDAMENTALS. They don't understand the fundamentals of the bitcoin tech nor do they understand the fundamentals of the financial world and it's apocalyptic debt scenario we are NOW in.

Perhaps it's not that people are stupid or retarded in their ability it's more a matter of 'ignoring' fundamental capital flow tendencies. So I guess i should re title it to IGNORANT traders.

I just had to post something as sometimes I think we live in a world of the living dead and a zombie apocalypse is upon us.

"One cycle is over, another is about to start","**What is the Bitcoin Ultimate Guide?**

The year of 2017 was spectacular and awesome for the cryptocurrencies. But was it really? Well, it was a spectacular year for cryptomarket indeed, Bitcoin has reached it's historical All-time-high and other cryptocurrencies have got the attention of the world's public as well. But was the year 2017 awesome as well? For some of the people it certainly was, especially for those, who have held the cryptocurrencies for many years.

Exponential growth of the cryptomarket in the late autumn of 2017 also attracted a massive public and the people have invested their savings into cryptomarket in the worst possible time. There is a special part in the Bitcoin Ultimate Guide which discloses behaviour like that  as a mania- the worst decision in terms of investment. Nevertheless, people are really driven by their emotions instead of using thei common sense.

**What has actually happened?**

It is public secret that money, which people have invested in cryptomarket at the time of mania, represented only a small percentage of the total market capital. Significant proportion of money, which caused rapid increase of cryptocurrencies's value came from the institutional investors. The first bitcoin's futures contracts of the world's giant CME were launched on the 18/12/2017. Purchasing a contract is basically a bet on whether Bitcoin's price will grow or fall. The first Bitcoin's future contracts have expired on the 29/06/2018- during the same day the Bitcoin's price hit the lowest point of the year 2018. If we evaluate the development of the end of 2017 and the launch of the Bitcoin's future contracts, we may find itdifficult to talk about the Bitcoin price bet in the form of features contracts. We could easily name it as a bet on certainty. It is quite clear that the money that caused the increase of cryptocurrencies's prices in the last month of the 2017 were gradually withdrawn from the market until the June 29, 2018, the day when futures contracts expired. The price of Bitcoin has reached its annual minimum and its has begun to grow again. It is difficult to think that the people who invested their savings in cryptomarket in December 2017, - and which represented only a minimal part of the total market capital- caused the dramatic decrease in the price of the Bitcoin. It's practically impossible. For more details about this process, please read the Bitcoin Ultimate Guide

**What is going to happen?**

We disclose the development of the cryptocurrencies since their inception. We compare, monitor and evaluate the factors that affect value of the cryptocurrencies. From our analysis it is obvious that history of the charts is repeating itself and that the specific parts of the charts do not only the value of cryptocurrencies but also indicate the psychology of the traders – people and their trading habits. Not to mention that those habits are also easily predictable for the best traders. The evolution of the previous charts is almost identical to the current charts, which is on it's bottom right now.

From the point of view of investment decision-making, we are entering the market at the best possible time, even though your emotions remember the exact opposite from the winter last year. What a paradox, isn't it? People claim that it is not possible to predict the Bitcoin's price.

How then is it possible that the logarithmic chart predicted Bitcoin's 10,000 $ linked to 22.11.2017 price in 2014? This price was reached by Bitcoin on the 28.11.2017, only 6 days later and therefore the logarithmic graph is just one of the factors that confirms the analysis in the Bitcoin Ultimate Guide.

Based on the

· historical development of cryptocurrencies,

· the launch of futures contracts and their expiration,

· the entry of the large financial corporations into the cryptoworld,

· analysis of human behavior and the upcoming global financial crisis it is relatively easy to predict the price of the Bitcoin as a commodity.

The future of the Bitcoins is written in detail in our Premium part of the Bitcoin ultimate guide.

**Why was the Bitcoin ultimate guide created?**

People have been deceived by misinformation, they lack trading skills and knowledge about the cryptocurrencies. They have lost their investments and we are certainly not happy with this.

Thu purpose of the Bitcoin ultimate Guide is to spread the knowledge about the Bitcoin and show the people how to avoid their mistakes from the past.

Because only a fool is doing the same mistake over and over again and expecting different results.

Blockchain tourism: a thrilling party that insomnias the world,"Recently, the People’s Daily issued a document entitled “High-quality development, and there is a future for the future”, indicating that various industries are developing, and blockchain and other technology applications are expected in the future. Blockchain finance and blockchain tourism are also taking the lead in this opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mnffucz8ili11.png

With the arrival of the graduation season and summer vacation, temperatures throughout the country continue to rise, and bad weather brings opportunities for summer tourism and water tourism. The holiday is also an assist for the midsummer tourist season. In 2017, the State Council issued the ""Ten. In the “Five Tourism Development Plan”, with the implementation of the plan, the governments of various regions have accelerated the introduction of the paid vacation system for employees and strictly implemented the relevant policies for traditional holiday holidays. The policy has given people more free time, and the country continues to encourage people to go out and travel.

However, in recent years, the scale of tourism that has been growing in recent years has brought opportunities to the tourism industry. At the same time, it has also faced many challenges, such as slaughtering, compulsory consumption, high-priced tickets, intermediaries, and information privacy leaks. These problems have not only attracted The resentment of tourists has also hindered the healthy development of the entire tourism industry.

The reasons for the chaos in the tourism market are: the government's supervision is not strict, and the second is the failure of tourism technology. The progress of the industry depends on the supervision and supervision of the policy, and it needs to rely on the industry's morality and technology to assist, and the recent hot zone The blockchain undoubtedly injects a strong-hearted agent into the tourism market. What kind of chemical reaction will happen when the blockchain + tourism = blockchain travel?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/rx23tx1bili11.png

Take the domestic blockchain travel platform rookie-LEOOY as an example. The relatively successful use of symmetric/asymmetric encryption technology to store IPFS distributed file system solves the user's privacy problem. Distributed computing and storage based on blockchain technology. The technology solves the cost problem of the platform and the merchant, and ensures that the platform data is transparent and transparent to solve the credit problem of the merchant.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lnmbubybili11.jpg

In simple terms, LEOOY's operating mode is similar to other Internet travel platforms. The difference is that LEOOY's operations are based entirely on the intricacies of smart contracts, which are pre-established rules. All participants only need to follow the rules, and there is no need for a centralized organization to operate the entire platform. Transactions between participants are achieved point-to-point and without any third party. That is, the consumer pays the money directly to the service provider, the service provider collects the money, saves the intermediate third party, and greatly reduces the operating cost of the service provider on the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g91m6dleili11.png

As one of China's major industries, tourism is rapidly developing today. We must not ignore the role of blockchain in the tourism industry. The application of blockchain in tourism is not only for tourism. Injecting fresh air into the industry also made us start to foresee a better travel lifestyle.

The application of blockchain technology by LEOOY, booking and other platforms has given us a lot of surprises. A brave new world needs to be developed and needs to be explored. Some professionals bluntly say that the blockchain is a thunderous party that makes the whole people sleepless. At present, we are in the process of transition from “Internet economy” to “blockchain economy”. We must build blockchain thinking and use this thinking to promote the development of the tourism blockchain economy. Only in this way can we affect the entire enterprise. Change.

How do most domestic(means China in this article) software get Tick?

Then there is often more than one transaction in 500 milliseconds, and the specific situation in it is completely a black box. Especially in the high-frequency trading strategy of commodity futures, the receiving speed of the Tick market has a decisive influence on the profitability of the strategy.

Most trading frameworks on the market use a callback mode, which means that there is at most one Tick in 500 milliseconds in ideal situation. Under the real situation onBar/onTick, it is good not to miss Tick. why? Because you have to deal with the whole code logic in onBar/onTick function, which costs a lot of time. Whether you want it or not, your strategy logic must be interrupted, you must use the state idle, like this:

More advanced mechanism

FMZ quantitative trading platform does not adopt this backward callback mechanism, but adopts the main function mechanism that does not interrupt the strategy logic, allowing users to control the strategy flow more naturally. Using C++ and Golang as a strategy underlying level, the upper level of strategy uses JavaScript / Python to handle logic problems. Combined with the event trigger mechanism, the strategy can also be used to process the market at the fastest speed in the first time.

Don't say that the scripting language is slow, unless you use it for neural network training, even if it was, it can be used in any occasion after adding Jit hot compilation. The entry-level strategy is not written here, and talk about the synthesis of futures high-frequency Tick. For example, if we connect to a futures company, we can only receive the market of this futures company. The speed and quality of our receiving are related to our own network, and also related to the load of the futures company's front-end machine.

So, how can we get more accurate futures Tick data faster? Under the FMZ Quant’s strategy model, you can easily operate the accounts of different futures companies, and combine their prices to process orders at the fastest speed. Under normal circumstances, we can get two Ticks per second from the futures company, but through the technology of combining market, taking the MA801 as an example, we can get a Tick with up to six times per second and no repetition.

This code can only be used in real market and cannot be backtested. If you don’t use it on FMZ Quant platform, you can reference the principle only.  
When adding the exchange, many futures companies can be added to carry out the concurrent fusion processing of the market. Here add two exchanges to state:

The code is as follows:

Demo effect

As shown above, at 21:24:44, the data of the first futures company is earlier than the second one. Adding two futures companies can show the effect, if you add more than 5 futures companies to merge together, then you basically have no possibility of missing Tick; if you are developing a high-frequency trading strategy, you’ve solved a very important and decisive step, namely the speed and stability of Tick receiving.

Offling Wallet in Plain Sight?,"I'm quite new to understanding the mechanisms of wallets so please bare with me.

As I understand it, the safest way to store coins is to generate a wallet public/private key set and then store those ""somewhere"" safe.

My concern is that I either lose the thing on which I scribbled/engraved my wallet keys and am thinking of ways to store it in multiple places in the cloud, but in such a way that it's not obvious that it's a bitcoin wallet key pair.

Things that come to mind is to embed it in an image, for instance and then upload the image to an image sharing service.  I then rely on memory to remember how to get to the image.

Or, chop it up in four parts and store it in four non related Google spreadsheets.

Or create four Google accounts and store it embedded in mails.

Wallet Security by Obscurity?,"I'm quite new to understanding the mechanisms of wallets so please bare with me.

As I understand it, the safest way to store coins is to generate a wallet public/private key set and then store those ""somewhere"" safe.

My concern is that I either lose the thing on which I scribbled/engraved my wallet keys and am thinking of ways to store it in multiple places in the cloud, but in such a way that it's not obvious that it's a bitcoin wallet key pair.

Things that come to mind is to embed it in an image, for instance and then upload the image to an image sharing service.  I then rely on memory to remember how to get to the image and where I would put it inside the image.

Or, chop it up in four parts and store it in four non related Google spreadsheets.

Or create four Google accounts and store it embedded in mails.

You get the idea.  So it's basically security by obscurity.

Are there any major flaws doing it this way?

I basically want to ""backup"" the keys to ""the internet"" where no matter where I'm in the world, I can get to it - but in a non-obvious obscure way that only I'll know now to ""decipher"".

My opinion on this Crack Wright BS,"These days I read this name again, and read some posts, and boy, this is so RIDICULOUS... We have an obvious conman here, a liar, manipulator, straight up clown, a real nasty t , and there are literally people who follow this dude or even defend what isays. we live in interesting times. IMHO not even jail is appropriate for this and it is beyond me how people let this man go and speak at events. Having absolutely no skill whatsoever other than deceiving people and claiming to have invented Bitcoin? Give me a break. I've been on the internet since 1997 but this is hands down the most brazen shit I have ever seen. ""Faketoshi"" is such a nice name, way too nice for what the conman really is.

BTC Bull Trap?,"Hi guys,
From this week's news, we saw how bitcoin buyers defended losses below the USD 6,250 support. Later, BTC/USD traded higher and broke the USD 6,400 and USD 6,600 resistance levels, going to rise and going to bull. So, going forward, if bitcoin price accelerates above the USD 6,800 and USD 7,000 resistance levels, there could be a solid rise in buying sentiment for BTC and altcoins.

Bitcoin network is a basic starting point for a society to build a new infrasctructure on,"What Tymothy Snyder is basically talking about (without even probably realizing to the fullest) is decentralization of societal processes. 

He's approached the realization of necessety to distance ourselves from politics and politicians, cause what we all need is ""take responsibilities ourselves"". Now that is the corner stone of crypto-anarchy. 
In a digital world of AI and fake (or true) digital (and not only) copies and clones there won't be a place for political (most not for global) leaders or heroes. And never was in reality but we chose to believe the myths we could trust or rather were forced to by the ""leaders"". 

There is only place for facts and science like there is basic place for a trustless Bitcoin neteork with a mathematical algorithm around which individulas will build up a new infrastructure for adequate cooperation.

Bitcoins hashrate &amp; difficulty levels have been on an epic bull run,"A year ago on Aug 24 2017, the mining difficulty and hash rate was considered to be off the charts high. The network was battle tested for over 8 years and the hashpower just kept increasing nearly the whole time. 1 year ago the the idea of becoming  a profitable miner required a seriously major investment...I recall thinking that ""this hash rate rate can't possibly continue to climb at this rate, it MUST be near the max.""

3 days ago was Aug 24 2018...a full year later and the Bitcoin mining difficulty increased to 6,727,225,469,722....One year earlier it was 888,171,856,257 you see how many times it doubled in the last year?
The predicted increase for the next adjustment is 7.1%!!

Now a 7.1% increase of last years difficulty level is considered a lot, but 7.1% of the current level is like adding 50% to what it was a year ago. That's hard to comprehend it's so high, and this is a bear market, right? Who could be investing so heavily into mining?

The power of this compounding growth is simply incredible....The money going into large mega scale Bitcoin mining is unfathomabley huge...Is there estimates or data regarding how much fiat is being invested into mining? How much fiat is going into R&amp;D of state of the art tiny nanometer ASICs?

If mining hashpower  was not a relevant metric for Bitcoin price valuation a year ago, it most certainly is today and is becoming more and more relevant every 2 weeks. We are talking serious investment.

To put this in perspective the last 2 difficulty increases alone, are very near equal to the entire difficulty of the network this time last year!! That's over 8.5 years of Bitcoin mining hashpower
 growth in just 4 weeks.

Holy F'n Sh1t! Miners and venture capital have been very very busy and surprisingly it's not so overt.

At this rate it will double in 3 months...would that happen in a bear market? To me this is some of the most bullish data available. I also live in Quebec and in the last few months it's become known the miners are here in a big way.

This site is an excellent tool to reference the hashpower and difficulty over time. (There are several good sites, I just like this one)

"CNBC documentary ""Bitcoin Boom or Bust""","CNBC has been advertising about this documentary they're showing featuring some guy who dresses weird while being interviewed named Justin or ""crypto kid"".  

He acts like he's super secretive, but then dresses really weird/uniquely, and does the interview in his extremely unique house.  I'm guessing people could track him down in like three seconds.  He even says he tried to change his name and those filings are generally public anyhow.  At one point he says he won't answer a question because of ""security through obscurity"" which is silly because anyone in the infosec community knows the rest of that quote is ""is not security.""  

Anybody else watch this documentary/think this guy and his behavior was particularly silly?  The rest of the documentary was pretty much what you'd expect from CNBC imho.  I generally like their reporting because it's largely free of irrationally strong emotions directed at a certain politician.

Blocks weight VS size,"For a long time, I was looking for a reliable source that shows blocks weight in a graphical way. Moreover, it turned out to be quite a difficult thing to get.

I decided it will be easier to write a script that runs on my own local node, and I'm sharing the results with you.

The graph shows the size of the blocks in bytes (orange) and the weight of the block (blue). The graph shows the data for blocks 447,120 (when BIP 91 was locked in July 2017) all the way to block 528,439 (last week).

If you care about the raw data, you can copy it from here:

Why mainstream media is promoting Bitcoin?

Why they are not entirely negative? Why they allow positive people to make positive comments?

Here is what is going to happen with Bitcoin,"The price is going to hit $7k, and if you haven't bought any you still most likely won't. You are going to think ""It'll go down"". Then it will hit $8k and you will have the same thought except perhaps you will think, ""Ah shit. I could have bought it at $7k and sold it at $8k. Would have made easy money. Whatever.""

This will keep happening, but your thoughts will change. At $15k you are going to start to get upset that you didn't buy it. You may even curse Bitcoin and hope it goes down in price. Not because you want to purchase it, but because you are pissed off that you didn't and you don't want to be upset that you didn't get on board in time.

Then the price is going to surpass $20k. You are sure it won't go higher, but you force yourself not to think about it because fucking damnit, it makes you angry that you didn't purchase it at $7k. 

With each $1k it climbs, it will eat at you. You still won't buy it because you are certain it is going to zero soon. With every dip  you hope it crashes because you think it is absolute bullshit that other people made these returns on something that you could have been a part of but chose not to. 

It'll hit $100k and you are going to hate yourself. Each time you looked at it and considered it, you chose the other path. You took the safe path. Sure hindsight and all but it won't matter. Every time you get financially stressed, each additional monetary burden and you will recall that time not too long ago you could have invested in Bitcoin. But you didn't. 

Be nice to yourself. Buy some of this digital gold before you see an 18 year old kid in his Lambo with a license plate that say ""I hodld"" drive by you and you open your door on the freeway and jump out of your car while screaming ""Why oh God why?!?!?!!?

## Tens of billions of P2P funds enter cryptocurrency world with the hope of filling “capital holes” with speculation​

The P2P industry is currently experiencing the biggest shake-up in a long while, with a large number of platforms being removed or going out of business.

Following this shake-up, platforms, funds, practitioners, and investors have unexpectedly started migrating to the world of cryptocurrency.

Several quantitative investment teams on the market have expressed that they have received inquiries from P2P platforms. These platforms state that their funds number in the billions or even tens of billions, and ask whether or not it is possible to use these funds to speculate and double their value in around 3 months.

“The capital chain for a lot of these platforms are breaking down, so they want to use the cryptocurrency market to earn money and fill in the holes.” states Bing Qian, head of a quantitative investment team.

A dangerous game of desperation is currently being played.

​

01 A Dangerous Game

“I’ll give you $6 billion; you should use it to speculate on crypto’s secondary market.“ A month ago, Mr. Qian met a mysterious person in this manner.

They immediately wanted to give $6 billion to invest, but the most Mr. Qian had ever handled was $1 billion.

The thought of such massive amounts of money figuratively falling from the sky made Mr. Qian very excited.

​

He even started about the possibility of using $6 billion to initiate a “Soros attack” within the cryptocurrency market.

In the end, he made his plan: invest long in the futures market and raise the price of the coins, then short the futures market and pressure the price downward.

“$6 billion is enough to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.” Mr. Qian spend the night checking over and over again that this feat was indeed possible.

It was a classic play from the stock market playbook, but the biggest risk was whether or not another investor had even more funds to use and could enter into a game with him.

​

“If my opponent has more funds than me, the risk will be high, but if there is a large amount of orders, then it would be possible to increase the rate at which I’m making money.” states Mr. Qian. If his plan really succeeded, he though it would be spectacular and become a classic in the history of digital currency.

​

“Doubling $6 billion in half a year, I don’t think it’s hard.” After repeated calculations, Mr. Qian found that the possibility of ending in the red was low.

However, the mysterious person wasn’t ready to give Bing Qian that much time, giving him time limits such as only “three months” or “as soon as possible”.

​

Bing qian started to get suspicious and started questioning the source of the mysterious person’s funds, “I felt that they were very anxious, not like other big investors, who have a mentality of slowly but easily making money.”

After countless questions, the mysterious person finally admitted that they actually come from a P2P platform that ended up having billions of dollars worth of liabilities. “At most it can last another three months, after which it will implode if the liabilities and vulnerabilities at not addressed.”

​

In other words, they were prepared to use investors’ money to make a final “life or death” gamble.

“If the platform went under while I was handling the funds, then I might get implicated when the authorities step in and trace the whereabouts of the funds.” Mr. Qian tried to think of ways to mitigate the risk, but in the end every move would have been risky.

After hesitating for two weeks, he suddenly saw the platform appear on the news.

It had already imploded, and investors were collectively protecting their rights.

Mr. Qian was happy he didn’t accept the ticking time bomb, but then he realized, a shockingly large amount of P2P funds were entering the cryptocurrency market.

And brave teams had already accepted the funds.

“There are some worth millions and some worth billions; none of the sums are small.” Mr. Qian states. He has a peer that has already accepted a $500 million deal, and within 4 months has realized a 70% income.

The business has essentially given him financial freedom.

In the words of Mr. Qian, this is called “The deal of a lifetime”.

During such a violent shake-up of the P2P industry, a large number of platforms are trying to make money in this way. If they make money, then the platform continues operating; if they lose money, then they run away via bankruptcy.

According to the founders of several quantitative investment teams, the amount of P2P funds entering the cryptocurrency market is estimated to be in the tens of billions.

Mr. Qian reasons, “This could be the reason for the relatively large price swings in the market recently.

While a final stand might sound brave, it is actually just playing a very dangerous game.

Investors’ money being put into such a high-risk scenario, is P2P’s final gambit.

​

​

02 Steering Migration

Besides P2P platforms proactively moving money into the cryptocurrency market, a large amount of retail investors have also started to shift their battleground.

Most platforms that have gone under recently have been high-risk, high-interest rate platforms.

That is, users who are willing to use the platform tend to be less averse to risk.And this group of people naturally fits with speculators.

After these platforms collapse, investors start looking for new targets.

Cryptocurrency is currently marked as their next destination.

Ye He, an investor, recently earned millions of dollars through P2P lending and has been transferring it into cryptocurrency speculation.

“I allocate Bitcoin and Ethereum on a 7:3 scale” Mr. He states. Shortly after buying, Mr. He was pleasantly met with a surge in price.

He also states, “The speed and return is much higher than that of P2P”

According to P2Peye’s data, net outflow from the industry was valued at CNY￥11.27 billion.

​

Using East Silver Valley and MinDai TianXia as examples, from the time East Silver Valley came online until now, the net outflow of capital has been unmanageable, with a net outflow of $1.6 billion in March.

While MinDai TianXia does not have a net outflow, the net inflow between May and June has dropped off a cliff, severely decreasing.

In a survey done by data firms, 30% of investors said they would continue to invest in online lending, but only after regulation has been improved.

Another 20% said they no longer planned to invest in online lending, but instead switch to digital currencies.

Using this ratio, then in June there will be at least $2.2 billion in net inflows to the cryptocurrency market.

In addition, practitioners have been fleeing the online lending industry, leading to a massive transformation in demographics.

“Before, my friends were doing P2P, but now if they aren’t doing blockchain, then they are speculating coin prices.” an anonymous online lending businessman confesses; before you could see a lot online lending news within your circle of friends, but now when you look, it is mostly blockchain news.

“Since the beginning of the year, there have been constant calls from companies dealing with blockchain or cryptocurrency inviting me to interview.” an anonymous operational staff member of an online financial platform is quoted as saying.

​

The operations and market personnel in the online lending industry are highly sought after in the blockchain industry.

“The industries both have elements of wealth management, and have a lot of commonalities from the perspective of operations and market promotions, so we are poaching people from the online lending industry.” an anonymous HR personnel at a blockchain company states. They have already poached several senior executives.

The online lending industry is currently becoming the biggest reserve of human talent available to the blockchain industry.

“The recent wave of departures if very noticeable, with nearly 30% of online lending practitioners joining the cryptocurrency sector.“ says Lisa, a headhunter who specializes in online finance.

On the other hand, many P2P companies that have left the scene have also made great efforts to enter the digital currency field.

“A lot of P2P companies are created by real estate groups from Wenzhou or local rich owners. After they leave the P2P sector, they start to invest in or speculate on coin prices” says an anonymous P2P platform founder.

It is evident that many practitioners, platforms, and funds have started to collectively shift from P2P to cryptocurrency.

​

​

03 Where is the Road?

All money flows towards the highest possible yield.

There is currently a migration of money from P2P to cryptocurrency.

And the whole industry is starting to suffer from a shortage of assets.

A-Shares are trending downward, Hong Kong stocks are weak, and bank earnings are low, so many investors feel that their investment channels are very limited.

If the trade war between China and the US becomes more intense, then everyone’s risk aversion will undoubtedly get worse.

Last August, when the North Korean nuclear crisis escalated, South Korean conglomerates flooded into the cryptocurrency market.

At the time, the price of Ether rose 67% in two weeks, pushing it close to $300.

Back in June 2016, England formally decided to leave the European Union through a “Brexit referendum”.

Bitcoin rose 25% the same day, reaching a price of $714.

Some believe Bitcoin has a similar safe-haven quality to gold. The financial market uncertainty caused by Brexit has let people to choose Bitcoin.

​

While cryptocurrencies are slowly emerging as a new haven asset, it is not enough to prove that the transition from online lending is a wise choice.

“It may being jumping from the tiger’s den into the wolf’s den.” states Mr. Qian, “You need to pay tuition to get into this business.”

The unspoken rules and operations in this field are extremely complex. New, unfamiliar users metaphorically face a bloody battlefield.

And the P2P giants that have entered the field could become the next wave of victims.

“These people can’t play the coin market; they will be frisked down the moment they enter” states an anonymous person who helps P2P bosses enter the cryptocurrency market. In this sector, P2P bosses are still too naive.

The cryptocurrency market has not been friendly and welcoming towards the incoming funds, instead resisting it with everything they have.

​

Note:

Looking back at the online lending industry, it is not all doom and gloom.

An industry’s upward and downward trends are inevitable, as some leave, some will stay.

Some practitioners believe after this wave of closures, the remaining people will be the elite.",1535437835,28/08/2018 06:30:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9awkok/tens_of_billions_in_p2p_funds_enter/,1

Selling BTC for Cash - UK,"Local BTC - Selling BTC for Cash - UK 

Hi guys, 

I’d like to hear what people’s thoughts are on this prospect. I myself know a few BTC traders who trade their BTC’s for cash. They meet their clients in person or receive the cash via the mail. Both options are listed on local bitcoin for buyers. 

I have always wondered is this really legal? Surely there must be rules in place that they need to follow? After all BTC is a currency and currency exchanges have to spends thousands getting the right licences to do it legally. 

Thank you very much in advance and I look forward to hearing answers. ",1535442315,28/08/2018 07:45:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9awy7h/selling_btc_for_cash_uk/,1
Digital property,"I sometimes ask myself, would I rather own a house or similar amount of bitcoin? Real world properties like houses are risky. A house could be built wrong or it could be destroyed in fire or natural disaster. Today houses are built so fast, that sometimes even new apartment houses leak water inside. Would you like to own apartment in such a building?

Living in rent is moving risk of living to third party and having ones life savings in scarce digital asset like bitcoin provides many benefits, such as low risk, high liquidity and easy transferability. All these benefits transfer directly to real life benefits. By not owning a house, I can just decide to move elsewhere whenever I want. No hassle or time needed to sell it.

The world is all the time moving towards subscribtion based services. It's so much easier and less risky to just have a right to use something rather than owning it.",1535442563,28/08/2018 07:49:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9awyw3/digital_property/,1

First to $2 Trillion Market Cap: Apple v. Bitcoin,"Apple won the race to $1 trillion by a lot. 

Some experts expect Apple to reach $2 trillion by 2027. See this article: r/https://www.thestreet.com/story/14252613/1/apple-is-an-undervalued-bank-and-warren-buffett-will-be-laughing-all-the-way.html

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which is at roughly $120 billion right now, has basically double its users per year since existence, according to Willy Woo's research. See this link: r/https://www.ccn.com/woos-law-bitcoin-users-double-every-12-months-major-factor-for-long-term-price-surge/

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's presume Apple reaches $2 trillion by 2027 and Bitcoin doubles in value as its user base doubles, on average, each year until then (it will probably be volatile during that time, of course).

That would mean Bitcoin eclipses the $2 trillion mark in 2023, when it goes into six figures per coin.

The accusations are in relation to Mt.Gox's bankruptcy as a result of hacking and alleged embezzlement in 2014. At the time, Mt.Gox lost approximately one million bitcoins, worth around $400 million at the time and nearly 7 billion in current day prices.

Is there an immortal trading strategy?," 

**NO. 1 Guide（**[**www.fmz.com**](http://www.fmz.com/)**)**

Everything in the world follows the law of conservation of energy. Trading strategies are no exception. The real challenge for quantitative traders is knowing that the strategy will grow old one day but never knowing which day it is.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/2o9gp1hl1ti11.jpg)

**NO. 2 Different views**

Some people think that the future market is constantly changing. A mature and stable trading strategy should suit for all future markets, whether it is a unilateral market or a volatile market.

Others believe that different strategies suits different markets. Even if the trading strategy is strictly tested, once the trading strategy has passed the life cycle, it should be re-examined to see if it still has a solid profitability.

 

**NO. 3 Magic formula is no exception （**[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)**)**

Before discussing this issue, let's look at an example—from the time of its inception in 1985 to 2005, Gotham Capital, led by Joel Greenblatt, created an investment miracle of making $7 million to $830 million with an average annual return of 40%.

In 2005, Joel published a 150-page book, “That still beats the Market,” which condensed his investment experience into an easy-to-understand “magic formula”: select the top 20-30 stocks form in a comprehensive ranking of high return on assets and low P/E ratio buy separately and sell them one year later.

This “magic formula” is a simple quantitative model. If following Joel’s investment method, the investor’s portfolio return rate will reach 30.8% during the 17 years from 1988 to 2004, while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index’s compound annual return is only 12.4%.

It looks beautiful, but Joel also pointed out the weakness of the magic formula.

“The magic formula has a bad performance of 5 months in average during the 12-month test period. During the whole year, the magic formula cannot defeat market every 1 year for 4 years. Taking 6 years as a test period, the formula has not been as good as the market for two consecutive years. For 17 years, the performance of formula is not as good as the market even for three consecutive years.

Three consecutive years of bad performance – which means that if you make a quantitative hedge fund according to the magic formula, you will suffer losses for three consecutive years.

When a strategy temporarily fails, do you suspect that the strategy is old? Or temporarily ineffective? Can you handle that? **（**[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)**)**

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/w7tu3zkp1ti11.jpg)

**NO. 4 Reflexivity of strategy**

Why the strategy fails, the most representative explanation should be reflexivity. In the book The Alchemy of Finance, Soros mentioned in explaining the theory of reflexivity: When you observe the market and enter the market, the market is not the market you originally studied.

That is to say, when a certain trading strategy in the market continues to be effective, more and more such strategies will be added to the market, and the original effective strategy will gradually become ineffective. Conversely, when a failed trading strategy has passed over a period and more and more people abandon this trading strategy, then this temporarily ineffective strategy will slowly become effective. It’s just like a circle.

**NO. 5 Necessary cost （**[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)**)**

""You can win the next game, but you can't win all the games."" Sometimes you should be determined to enter, sometimes you should do nothing. As a quantitative trader, you should execute your trading strategy seamlessly. If not, once there is a sharp drawdown, you won’t know the problem is the trading strategy or not following the trading strategy.

Objectively speaking, a problem related to the success or failure of a transaction and survival is also a problem that is difficult to be solved perfectly. No matter what assumptions your trading strategy is based on, no matter which method you use, when this assumption does not exist, you must pay the price. No one will find it ineffective before the strategy fails. This is a necessary cost.

Although we can't accurately determine if the trading strategy really fails or it will become effective again after the temporary failure, but we can still take some measures to cope with the possible situation.

**NO. 6 How to deal with**

When we judge whether the trading strategy is still effective, the first problem to be faced first is that this strategy is temporarily ineffective or permanent failure?

In the face of this problem, we can examine it like this:

1. The drawdown has exceeded 1.2 times that of the maximum drawdown in backtesting.

2. The maximum loss per day exceeds 1.2 times that of backtesting

3. The maximum loss per week exceeds 1.2 times that of backtesting

4. The average profit is lower than 0.8 times that of backtesting.

5. The number of failures continues to rise.

In the real market, when one or more of the above-mentioned situations appear, be careful, which may be a temporary failure of the strategy or a permanent failure. If this happens, first stop the strategy and continue to use the simulate market for verification until it passes the test.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/nfr7ejdv1ti11.jpg)

**NO. 7 Trading concept （**[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)**)**

The trading market is a complex environment. In a stable environment, complex trading strategies are more resilient, and complex trading strategies are superior to simple trading strategies. But once this ecological environment changes, complex trading strategies are more likely to fail.

A robust trading strategy has three main points: First, the trading strategy can adapt to most different market conditions; second, the trading strategy remains simple, and the simple strategy is not susceptible to changes in the market environment. Third, the risk management is simple.

A trading strategy that performs well in a particular period is less able to adapt to the future environment. The profit speed and the robustness are opposite, and the trading strategies that are effective at the micro level are macroscopically weak. Therefore, a long-term effective trading strategy is very flat in a certain period.

If the time is long enough, no matter which strategy will eventually fail one day, like a perpetual motion machine, there is no such thing as an immortal new trading strategy in the market. No matter how much energy you put in, how confident you are, be prepared to fail. Because this is part of trading, if you cannot accept, stay away from it!

25% of italian football club bought with crypto," As [Sky Sport](https://sport.sky.it/calcio/lega-pro/2018/08/27/serie-c-rimini-25-per-cento-quote-societa-criptovaluta.html) reports, 25% of the shares owned by the club, which plays in Serie C, is about to be sold to [**Heritage Sports Holdings**](http://hsh.football/), a company from the United Arab Emirates that deals with investments in the world of sport.

For the first time in Italy, **the payment will be done with a cryptocurrency** thanks to the Quantocoin partnership.

The confirmation came directly from the President of Rimini, **Giorgio Grassi**, who during a press conference stated:

*“Negotiations with this group have been going on for a couple of months \[…\]. Heritage Sports Holdings with its partner Quantocoin will try to bring to the team and to the city new ideas and synergies from the sporting, brand image and technological point of views. Heritage Sports Holdings’ participation is innovative in view of its* *crypto payment system (QTCt) and the use of* *blockchain* *technology, for which Heritage Sports Holdings is already at the forefront in other countries. \[…\] This acquisition will enter the history of football, bringing a very important resonance to the city of Rimini. In recent weeks Heritage Sports Holdings has shown great interest in the Rimini brand and in our innovative approach to football. The new members appreciated the transparency of Rimini F.C. (the same transparency that we are currently practising by telling you about these developments), its economic sustainability, its territoriality, its commitment to the world of solidarity and also the critical mass that our world expresses with all its affiliated companies”.*

Heritage Sports Holdings also owns Gibraltar United, a football club known to be one of the first to pay part of the wages to its players in cryptocurrency.

In Italy, however, it already owns [Mantova](http://hsh.football/our-clubs/).",1535458937,28/08/2018 12:22:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ayfuj/25_of_italian_football_club_bought_with_crypto/,1

"How many Satoshis will there ever be? 2,100,000,000,000,000","Eventually when there is mass adoption we will begin dealing, speaking, and thinking in smaller units like millibitcoin and microbitcoin, but the most elemental bitcoin unit is the satoshi.

How many satoshis are there (or at maximum)? This many:

2,100,000,000,000,000

Which is found by multiplying the maximum 21 million bitcoin by the number of satoshis per bitcoin, which is 100 million.

How do you pronounce that huge number? Like this:

""Two quadrillion one hundred trillion.""

How many satoshis are available to us now (have been mined)?

Well, we've mined about 17 million bitcoin out of the 21 million maximum. Times 100 million that comes out to:

1,700,000,000,000,000

or, ""One quadrillion seven hundred trillion.""

How many satoshis is that for each human being alive today? Taking a 7-billion approximation, that comes out to:

214,285 satoshis per human being.

In a total bitcoin-takeover scenario, where bitcoin truly moons and comes out to a price of, say, $1 million per coin and goes into worldwide use, each satoshi would have to be worth about 1-cents.

In a total-bitcoin-victory scenario, it seems that there are enough satoshis in the world to run commerce at even the smallest level.

Any strategy for LN payment channel creation?,"Running a LN node and opening up payment channels to get started. I sent some amount of BTC to my full node wallet that is supporting the LN node. Is there any approach that I should use to divvy up that full amount of BTC among various payment channels?

i.e. You could make one payment channel to one other LN node for the full amount, or a hundred very small channels or anything in between. If you have many channels, is there a reason you’d want several different channels of varying capacity opened with the same node, or should every payment channel be to a unique node?

Obviously you “can” do any of these things, but I’m just wondering if there’s a fundamental reason that some options are better than others, or that some of the above approaches would be nonsensical.

With the growing number of transactions clogging up the blockchain and online casinos being a part of this, it's nice to have a positive outlook into the future. :)

What do you think?

Bitcoin stuck for 6 hours now,"Hey everyone. So I sent $70 something to my paxful account from Coinami. I used high priority like I always do to avoid situations like this. Never had this happen to me, just heard of it happening to people and the advice I seen a lot was to send it with a higher fee which I did. 
It’s going on 6 hours, still stuck unconfirmed. It’s under 500bytes so I’m a little confused as to why it’s stuck. Couple questions on my end. I’m not a complete newbie but I’m not by any means a seasoned crypto guy, I just like trading and waded into the bitcoin pool a while back and every day is a learning day for me. I can google the answers I guess but I really like being able to learn from people who have experienced this, it’s always how I’ve learned. Hated textbook answers, real experience answers are better from real people. 

So my questions are: 1)How long do these usually take to either end up in my paxful wallet or back in Coinami?
2) It will end up in either one of my wallets right? It’s not just going to be stuck in this limbo forever? 

I appreciate your feedback and I love this sub, I’ve learned a lot the past week+ here in reddit from y’all. Thank you. ",1535472832,28/08/2018 16:13:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9b099v/bitcoin_stuck_for_6_hours_now/,1

If you answered 1, go ahead and download Crypto Millionaire from the  link below. This app will help you diversify in a smart way, especially  right now that' it's such a good time to buy the millionth of supply of  top coins on the cheap.

If you answered 2, sell everything and become a pimp. It's the only way you will be able to keep selling bottoms, haha!

This Narrative Part 2...,"Earlier this month (Aug. 8th), all the Bitcoin experts implied that Bitcoin was falling massively because of the SEC delay to the VanEck twins ETF which I knew was total bullshit. Why would a delay affect prices even a little let alone so massively? When the last current hope in a Bitcoin ETF, ProShares ETF failed last Wednesday (08/22), how did the crypto market respond? It didn’t respond at all. A few small traders sold anticipating a massive dump but the whales bought it all up and maintained total stability in the markets. The entire crypto market remained unchanged around $207 billion. If the logic is that a delay in ETF announcement can lead to a $60 billion drop, then the official announcement of an ETF rejection should lead to total chaos, 100s of billions of $$ in crypto losses. Buy, nothing happen because these so-called Bitcoin experts don’t know shit and they love using false narratives as if they’re Fox News. Next, they will blame global warming for Bitcoin’s next fall followed Thanos killing the Avengers and last of course blame BearManPig. Because they have nothing and that is what they do. I’m taking about the Coindesks’, the CNBCs, the Motley Fools’, the Forbes and the CoinTelegraphs. All of these news sources are compromised and should not be trusted. Do several forms of your own independent research and never entrust in these fake pundits. Good luck!

Accepting BTC in my online store (CBD oil) - looking for help/feedback,"I'm opening a brick and mortar CBD store that also has online sales. The store is opening later this week and the website is live, though still a work in progress. I've added the option to purchase products using bitcoin, but I think the process could be much more elegant than what I've come up with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using Wix for the site, and I'm trying not to resort to using a 3rd party payment processor. The current checkout process that I'm hoping to streamline:

* customer adds products to cart
* proceed to checkout
* input shipping details
* choose payment type - here's where it starts to get weird... in order to pay with bitcoin you have to select ""Manual Payment"" - I can't change this text in Wix, but there are two other options I could choose for this text: ""Cash Payment"" or ""Offline Payment""
* select ""manual payment"" - this opens a text box with instructions I've written on how to convert the USD checkout total to BTC and I've included my payment address. There's also a link to a page that includes a currency converter and a QR code for my payment address.
* once the customer has sent BTC, they have to navigate back to the checkout page and click ""Place Order"" - if this step is skipped we won't know who sent us BTC and what they intended to purchase.

I'm really hoping some of you have some insight on how this process can be improved! Any and all help is greatly appreciated...

&amp;#x200B;

You can run through the checkout process on the site without making a purchase (just don't hit ""place order"" and you can abandon the cart): [615 CBD](https://sixonefivecbd.com).

Bank of America’s Newest Cryptocurrency Patent is a Vault Storage System for Enterprises," Based on public documents that were published by the [U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/uspto-honors-6-more-ibm-blockchain-technology-patents-in-just-1-week/)(USPTO), **Bank of America** has initiated another [application](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220180240112%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20180240112&amp;RS=DN/20180240112). The second-largest banking institution in the country wants to provide a management system for storing cryptocurrency within their company. Lately, the company has been working on educating themselves about the requirements for institutional organizations that want to secure private keys.

The detailed document discusses how *Bank of America* plans on using a computing device as a method of managing the tags for [blockchain encryption](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/tokenization-how-it-works-token-types-encryption-differences-guide/), but this is not new technology for them. In fact, they already had submitted a proposal in 2014 to develop an online vault storage system for cryptocurrency.

In the patent, Bank of America demonstrates how they want to be part of the efforts to make cryptocurrency a mainstream option for the public. However, by making their *database a safe place* for these types of transactions, consumers can have all the trust that they have with their bank and will not have to keep up with a private key.",1535525206,29/08/2018 06:46:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9b6we7/bank_of_americas_newest_cryptocurrency_patent_is/,1

"One key to solve the four major problems in the traditional tourism industry, what is the ability of blockchain tourism?","In the past two years, blockchain technology has flourished. Under the interaction of capital and media, the aura of the blockchain with the ""new force of technological revolution"" has become a topic of concern in the industry. The current blockchain technology is the most widely used. The financial industry, and blockchain tourism has become a new round of technology applications that the public is looking forward to.

First of all, let us first understand what problems in the tourism industry can be solved by blockchain tourism.

&amp;#x200B;

**False information**

With the rapid development of the tourism industry, more and more businesses are stationed in the platform, the service quality of each merchant is mixed, and the brushing of the single brush has been a well-known thing for the public. In the case of so many false information, the district will be It is very necessary to apply the blockchain to the tourism industry. Based on the decentralized trust mechanism of the blockchain, the company can recommend the most realistic and user-friendly restaurants, hotels and shopping stores through multi-faceted data analysis. The information is really thrown into the ""trash can"".

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sfgsxnfkvzi11.jpg

**Personal information disclosure**

“Understanding how the travel agency leaks personal information of passengers?” “Ctrip leaks customer information and concerns, the industry is exposed to more lenient travel websites” and other news is endless, personal information can not be well protected to give users a headache, which is one of the biggest drawbacks of traditional tourism. The Yunnan Provincial Industry and Commerce Bureau has introduced blockchain technology. Domestic LEOOY, Tripio and booking are also the leaders of blockchain tourism, comprehensively rectifying the tourism market, ensuring the circulation of data in various regulatory departments, and users in terms of personal information. In order to get the relevant protection.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/82ny0d6kvzi11.jpg

**Fraud problem**

In the process of making travel arrangements, we also face endless problems and are even constantly asked to provide personal information and credit card information. Second, there will be fraud problems, travel agencies lose up to 0.44% per year, and 4% of aircraft are scheduled to be rejected for fraud. All of these problems cost the tourism industry $4.8 billion annually. Identity management and smart contracts in blockchain technology can solve these problems perfectly, streamline traveler's equipment, consolidate contracts between companies, travellers and travel agencies record all transactions in one block, no doubt or hide cost.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/y7bw79jmvzi11.jpg

**Third-party platform**

The difference between the third-party platform is the most helpless thing for the user. The heart is always “Angry, still have to smile”. The rapid development of the domestic blockchain travel platform such as LEOOY and Youlv Chain has changed the sales method of tourism products.LEOOY boldly removed the third-party centralized management platform, realized peer-to-peer transactions and real-time settlement, and solved the existing transaction settlement problem. Simply and rudely, it is to remove the third-party platform and make the user experience more comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/nbfwbw9ovzi11.png

In addition to the above four problems, blockchain tourism can solve many large and small tourism problems. In recent years, the blockchain concept has made blockchain technology a new favorite in various fields. China's blockchain industry is currently developing at a high speed. At the stage, entrepreneurs and capital are constantly pouring in, the number of enterprises is increasing rapidly, the application of blockchain is accelerating, boosting the high-quality development of traditional industries, and accelerating industrial transformation and upgrading. However, letting dreams come to realize realization is the most important issue.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the development trend of blockchain tourism is still very good. The blockchain tourism platforms such as LEOOY, Youlv Chain, and booking have already made us see hope. In the near future, we may unexpectedly gain more Surprise.

"Whoever has just added 6+Exahash power to BTC in the last month, thank you from the BCH community","I thank you for not diverting your hash rate to BCH and doing an overwhelming attack on the BCH network that would cost BCH investors unaware of this real risk a small fortune.  

It would clearly be trivial to rob anyone who was daft enough to put money into the BCH network these days now that sort of power has been wielded.

For instance someone controlling that sort of hashing power (6+Exahashes) could easily pull off a 51% attack on the insecure BCH network with a mere 4 Exahashes protecting it.  

A simple deposit of say 1000 BCH (Today's value of around $600k) to an exchange, wait for 2-3 blocks of deposit time, exchange to BTC, withdraw the BTC (Around 85BTC at writing), now fork the BCH chain to reissue the last 5-6 BCH blocks (perhaps taking 1-2 hours) merely omitting your original BCH transaction and ta-dah you have that 1000BCH back to double spend on another exchange and gained $600k of real value.  If people were still in la-la land believing BCH was secure and continued using it you could simply repeat-rinse until they got the message.

Yes that exchange would bar you from depositing BCH again but nothing stopping others opening accounts and doing the same since the BCH network is simply pwned at this stage.  (I have no idea how a decentralised exchange could even offer any protection out there for BCH holders at the moment other than merely dropping the coin).

The fact that you haven't done this and making meagre profits mining (6ExaHash/54Exahash = 11% of the block rewards = $11% of $12m per day = $1m per day) even though you could generate probably $1m+ in an hour of attacking BCH shows you believe in BTC and have ethics.  

I'm not confident other miners would be so selfless so perhaps this is more a PSA that if you own any BCH this is a very real risk to be aware of as the attack would happen quickly.

19-year old sim swapper buys luxury cars with stolen BTC,"August 17th, a 19-year-old boy by the name of Xzavyer Narvaez was arrested and charged with several crimes consisting of grand theft, computer crimes, and identity fraud. Xzavyers’ case has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community in particular. Xzavyer has been sim swapping, which may not sound like any way to acquire BTC or even hack but it is indeed. The technique used by these ‘hackers’ is simple, hackers call the service providers of their victims and convince them that have lost their sim and need the number to be swapped to another card. Once the hacker has confirmed their ‘identity,’ through answering basic personal questions which could be obtained from online, the numbers will then be swapped. Michael Terpin is the CEO of TransformGroup and co-founder of an angel group for BTC called BitAngels. Michael filed for a 224 Million USD lawsuit against his service provider, AT&amp;T, to whom he believes gave hacking access to sim swappers. Michael has been the victim of two crypto heists, resulting in a loss of 24 Million USD, these heists were on June 11th, 2017 and January 7th, 2018. Once the hacker has a victims number, they will be able to change passwords of emails and crypto-exchanges by having the advantage of the users' number, eliminating the security of two-factor authentication. Hackers can then transfer victims crypto to their own wallets. Police obtained records from payment provider and exchange, BitPay and Bittrex. Police saw that between the dates of March 12th and July 12th, there was a flow of 157 BTC within the account of Xzavyer which is worth roughly 1 Million USD. Xzavyer used his stolen riches to buy sports cars, he recently purchased a 2018 McLaren, the car was purchased with some BTC and the trade-in of a 2012 Audi R8 which had been bought in June 2017 using Bitcoin. The police have identified at least three victims of Xzavyer, one reporting of a hack last year in which he had lost up to 150,000 USD. Although there has been sufficient evidence tying Xzavyer to the crimes, he was released without bail three days after being arrested, August 20th. Xzavyer may be out, but Ortiz is still in jail. 

**The first sim swapper**

Xzavyer is not the first to be charged with the crimes of sim swapping, also known as ‘port out’ scams. The first man to be caught and charged under these allegations was Joel Ortiz. Joel was on his way to Europe when the police arrested him, he came clean quick; informing police on the 40 phone numbers he hijacked, his co-conspirators and the Millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies they controlled. Although he was not alone, he was the first to be caught. He confessed to victim targeting, particularly at the May Consensus bitcoin conference in New York where he allegedly stole 1.5 Million USD from a single entrepreneur. Ortiz was tracked down through a series of warrants, police identified two IMEI numbers linked to the stolen number, one belonging to Ortiz. The police were then able to track 40 stolen numbers connected to his IMEI number through the AT&amp;T service provider. Xzavyer was tracked down as a sim swapper when police found his email logged into a phone used by Ortiz, leading them to further investigation and then Xzavyer. But Ortiz and Xzavyer are not alone, there is a whole community utilizing sim swapping as a way of taking from the hard workers and rewarding themselves with 2018 McLarens. Sources told Motherboard of the best sim swapper out there, by the name of Xzavyer. We can only hope that the truth surfaces and Xzavyer faces the trail he deserves, and in the long run, his community of hackers come to the same.",1535535914,29/08/2018 09:45:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9b7tnp/19year_old_sim_swapper_buys_luxury_cars_with/,1
"Is next break $7,600? FOMO don't panic!!!","Traders may empirically learn a lesson that periods of low volatility often come to a fierce end.

&amp;#x200B;

After a period of trading sideways, just yesterday, the price of Bitcoin finally broke through $7,000, and is expected to continue to rise, breaking through the $7,800 mark.

&amp;#x200B;

This breakthrough is not without warning. Just the day before yesterday, bearish bitcoin futures bets hit the lowest point, which is also a sign that the bitcoin market will turn into a bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the bitcoin market does not seem to be affected by the rejection of the ETF proposal, which means that the bitcoin bear market has already reached the bottom of the bottle, and the bull market will be launched.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](7xxxpl9c70j11 ""four-hour price"")

 

As can be seen from the above four-hour price analysis chart, the price has been hovering between $6,700 and $6,850, the bulls continued to ultimately pass the peak of the prior rally ($6,899) seen on Aug.22. The next resistance is expected to be The price of $7,165.

A short-term pullback to prior resistance($6899) would be considered healthy, as price often falls back to prior resistance in order to prove it can hold as support.

Since April, Bitcoin prices have been at a standstill against the lowest point, and according to EMAs (100), Bitcoin has formed an upward momentum. During this period, the biggest resistance price was $7,800. So it is highly probable that Bitcoin will break through 7,800 again.",1535536021,29/08/2018 09:47:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9b7tzb/is_next_break_7600_fomo_dont_panic/,1

Shapeshift accepts orders they can't immediately process. Are they an ethical company?,"I'm writing this as my shapeshift order blinks ""awaiting exchange"", as it has for the past 1 hour *after* my deposit was confirmed in the blockchain and acknowledged by shapeshift's site.

1 hour is already way past the *instant* exchange *without custodial risk* that is promised on their homepage.  Based on these promises, and past usage, I was depending on receiving exchanged funds for a time-sensitive matter.  Now, it is anyone's guess when or if they will arrive.

Googling ""Shapeshift awaiting exchange"" finds numerous complaints from customers that have waited days or weeks in this ""awaiting exchange"" limbo, often with no responses to repeated support inquiries until they finally air matters in public.

It seems clear to me that at times Shapeshift is accepting customer deposits when they do not have funds on hand to make a payout in the desired currency.  imho, an ethical company that claims to provide instant non-custodial exchange would inform the customer of this before the deposit is made, and/or would provide an automatic *instant* tool for the customer to receive a refund if exchange cannot be made in instant fashion as promised.

So I ask you reddit.  Is shapeshift an ethical company?    

Will Eric Voorhees step up to correct these problems in the service?

edit:  as I finished typing this up, the exchange finally completed. Total time:  1 hour 20 minutes, not counting initial 20 minutes blockchain confirm time.  could've been much worse, but certainly not instant.  And I certainly would have claimed a refund and chosen another method if given the opportunity.  Thus I am still posting this.

Bitcoin will continue to fail until people use BTC to trade rather than “HODL.”,"Having any currency remain static is detrimental to it’s viability, trade creates growth, and all the HODLrs are doing the opposite. 

Supply and demand are basic economic concepts, and HODLing keeps the demand low because there is no reason to use bitcoin other than to save! 

Im not a financial expert, but jeez people think bitcoin will eventually succeed one day rather than put in the work to make it something really life changing.

Extortionists Demand that CheapAir Pay Ransom in BTC - coinness.com,"CheapAir, the popular online travel agency, posted on their blog that they received threats involving a social media smear campaign if they didn't pay up $10,000 in Bitcoin. The CheapAir team said the hackers claimed they would have sent ""thousands of negative items on our social media accounts,"" posted bad reviews on websites such as Trustpilot, as well as ruining their SEO rankings by ""spamming our blog backlinks with negative and profane anchor text.""  

In spite of having to deal with this type of threats, CheapAir still stands by its decision to offer cryptocurrency payments, even though many companies are starting to back out.

solution for error message when setting up lightning network &amp; wallet,"I was getting this error when unlocking my newly created lightning wallet:  


""Primary chain is set to: bitcoin unable to create chain control: unable to connect to bitcoind: status code: 401, response: ""

I double and triple checked everything and couldn't understand why I couldn't connect. It was extremely frustrating. I googled around and finally found this post:  


[https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/924](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/924)

&amp;#x200B;

It says that some people were getting that error from having a ! or # or @ characters in their rpcpasswords.

&amp;#x200B;

My old rpcpassword was:   

gnF#cC%7Aen7\^Sb

&amp;#x200B;

The pound sign, percentage sign and up arrow characters were messing up my lightning wallets ability to connect.

After I changed my rpcpassword to not include any special characters it connected just fine w/o the error on the first try.

&amp;#x200B;

 I spent like 3 days pissed off and and completely clueless as to why my wallet was having connection issues, so I thought I'd share this for anyone else who might be in the same situation.

Bitcoin related topic (cosplay),"So last year I cosplayed at a bitcoin. It was pretty much the logo above my head fixed against a wire attached to my hat so it kinda floated above me.

Nobody else there was related to any type of crypto. I got a lot of laughs, questions and little jokes (how much are you worth? Oh give it a second, now you've tanked ^^^hehe...). It was nice being unique amongst all the naruto/deadpool/zentai suits dva.

Now that btc has drastically fell since last year i was wondering what kind of funny meme i can put ontop of my logo? Something sad or creative, any suggestions will be appreciated!",1535561393,29/08/2018 16:49:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bazzz/bitcoin_related_topic_cosplay/,1

My dad invested some of my funds into Bitcoin with a company. Do they seem trustworthy?,"So my dad had been recommended by a colleague to invest in Bitcoin through a group called Glodax. He invested about 3.3K of my funds and the manager purchased XGD and G-ETH with that amount. This was about a year ago. The last statement I've received was in June, and I requested to sell some of the funds. The manager said that my request has been processed and I should be seeing the funds soon on my bank account, but it's been a few months now and it hasn't been showing.. I've emailed the manager, and he doesn't seem to be getting back to me. My dad says they seem to be slow on things, so I shouldn't worry too much but as I'm in college now (I'm quite new to this cryptocurrency thing), it is quite a sizeable amount to me, so I want to know whether this company seems to be reliable or not, and what the process is in terms of selling via a 3rd party.

You want ETF and SEC approval then you are living in a delusional world cause the financial oligarchs and their captured regulators will never have an even playing field. There only concern is how to fleece the middle class. 

I am sick and tired of people ignoring the facts. buybacks will gut america's middle class and working class mark my word and that is the purpose. Boom and bust cycles are completely engineered and most people still look to these folks as sincere.. They are not and they are also suppressing bitcoin and gold both as within the next few months .. Kansas is going by by.

Let's take a minute to remember the Pineapple fund,"https://pineapplefund.org

Tons of great causes were donated bitcoin, and it helped improve the image of bitcoin during the last bull run, and straight up made it more fun. Let's hope more long time bitcoin hodlers will follow that example. There's no doubt that it increases joy and morale in Bitcoin. Go out and micro-donate some mbtc to newcomers if you can. We're very insulated here in r/bitcoin and in reality too many people still think btc is only used on the dark web. We still have to change the perception.

Is today the day to buy more bitcoin,"I have been a fence sitter. When the fork happened last year my general stance was that bitcoin would continue and bitcoin cash would eventually go to zero.

I rationalized not being greedy and keeping both splits with the bitcoin cash being an insurance in case a miscalculation had been made in scaling.

I’m seriously thinking to flip that cash for some more bitcoin. I’ve felt that figures involved in bcash scene pretty scummy for while now but the main reasons are recent reports on hash rates and holdings. 

I want these things:

1) is it true that the bcash hash rate is declining whilst bitcoins has been massively expanding?
2) is it true that bitmain holds a million bitcoin cash and only 22,000 bitcoin? If it is true then bitcoin cash price is definitely being propped up and it’s currency (never mind its network) is not well distributed.
3) bitcoin cash is now at close to its lowest valuation vs bitcoin since it received major exchange listings.

If people can refer me to good sources to verify these points I would be grateful.",1535596114,30/08/2018 02:28:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfq1d/is_today_the_day_to_buy_more_bitcoin/,1

What would be the best details to include, or web resource to point to that would make the most compelling explanation for these traditional finance types? I think mentioning the BTC's market cap in comparison to gold and the stock market would be helpful, for example.

Thanks!",1535597030,30/08/2018 02:43:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfu1l/how_to_explain_bitcoin_to_lenders/,1

"Bitcoin Hashrate Breaches All-Time High, Investors Remain Bullish","*""Following Bitcoin’s monumental run-up to $20,000 in late 2017, prices began to fall, and have barely stopped to breath on the way down. As it stands, the price of BTC has declined by over 60% since its all-time high, rightfully leading some to believe that mining activity fell in correlation with prices. But crypto miners have seemingly shrugged off the drop, with the Bitcoin hashrate establishing new highs on a near-weekly basis.""*

""*While Bitcoin’s hashrate figure has been on an unrelenting crusade upwards for the better part of a decade, in the past 72 hours, Bitcoin’s hashrate has seen a non-linear spike to the upside. As per data compiled by* [*Blockchain*](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)*, a US-based crypto infrastructure firm, the hashrate of the network saw a 35% run-up on Saturday and Sunday to a breath-taking ATH of 62 EH/s (quadrillion hashes/second)""*

Litecoin Creator Charlie Lee Recommends Buying Bitcoin in Bear Market - coinness.com,"The cryptocurrency market has now been in a bear cycle for more than two-thirds of the past year, and, as August prepares to roll in September, predictions from past months that the bitcoin price would test its all-time high in 2018 appear less and less likely. 

However, even after this prolonged decline, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee says that the flagship cryptocurrency is still a good buy. Speaking with CNBC, Lee said that the dropoff in prices has created an excellent investment opportunity for long-term bulls who have cash-in-hand that they can afford to lose.“It's always good to buy on the way down to dollar-cost average your buy-in,"" he said. ""As long as you don't spend money that you can't afford to lose, I think that's fine.

Questions by a non Noob,"Hi All, 

I have been in the space since 2015, and I got obsessive with the tech that naturally led to a lot of reading, watching and listening, way back when nobody cared and I had no one to talk about it (didn't even know reddit existed). I believe I have a good understanding of the underlying technology and what makes it an inevitable future for the masses. I stopped looking at the price a while now (its easier I suppose when even at the lowest point after the crash, I am still making a very good profit) and I am a true hodler. Nevertheless I do have some questions related to unverified transactions on the network so please help me if you can:

1) Miners that are in the race to add the next block on the blockchain select the transactions they want to include in their block before trying to solve the problem from a pool of unverified transactions published on the network. Where are these unverified transactions ""sit""? where is that pool ""located"" within the network?
2) Can the miners all include the same unverified transaction into the block they are trying to solve (i have a feeling this is the case) or is it that once it is picked by a miner to include in the next block it is off the pool, therefore no one else can pick it? I understand that if someone ""solves"" the next block everybody else drops the content of the blocks they were trying to solve back to the pool of unverified transactions to be picked up again for the next cycle.

Thanks in advance

I am done guys - this is scary as hell and I have difficulty trying to live on this world," “Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but \[also\] at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth.

Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become ""profiteers,"" who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.

Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”

\- John Maynard Keynes in 1919

"My personal experience of why a DECENTRALIZED currency is not only a trend, but also a HUMAN RIGHT.","I consider myself as  casual crypto trader. I read about the block chain technology, invested some of my fiat to crypto and at the same time, do some arbitrages. However, before what happened just a few hours ago, I'm not sure if I believe that being decentralized is that big of a deal. I had lived by doing pretty well relying strictly on the traditional financial system. Reputable commercial banks are everywhere. I live in Taiwan, which is a democratic country and I had felt completely secured about my financial assets before today. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have traded on P2P OTC sites for bitcoins regularly. I just want to make like a few percentage off my Bitcoin by doing so. There is this person who I've traded regularly for the past month. He first traded with me on this OTC site but after a few trades, we decided to trade on our own to avoid fees. Everything looks normal until today that I went to my bank trying to transfer some funds. I was told that my funds were ""frozen"" and I had to ask the authority to know exactly what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I was surprised but since I have only 3 to 4k USD left in that account, it sucks but not unbearable. Later on in the same afternoon, I logged into another bank account of mine. FROZEN AGAIN! My third bank account, FROZEN. I was in disbelief! I immediately went to the police station tried to figure out what happened. The police officer told me that someone had sued me for civil fraud. I told the police officer that I've done some bitcoin transactions over the counter with a lot of people but I did pay every time. The reply I got is that I have to wait until the court's approval so that I can have access to my accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

I was furious. There is no search warrant. There is no investigation. NO DUE PROCESS whatsoever. All my personal wealth has been frozen without any proof of me doing anything wrong. The police officer then told me that I may be involved in a  tripartite scam. I looked up online and this looks so ridiculous to be true. If you want to mess with someone, you can just send him like 100 bucks to his personal account and file for defraud, then there is a possibility that he will be deprived for his rights to all his accounts. I don't know if this is a world standard but this is what happens in Taiwan, which I consider one of the most liberal country in Asia.

&amp;#x200B;

To put everything into perspective, I have made a total of roughly 5 to 7k the most off selling bitcoin over the counter. The amount which is being frozen now is over 100K USD. This is just so unfair in the modern world that this can be done in today's society. I don't know that much about laws but in my opinion, it also clearly violates  the principle of proportionality. 

 

After this incidence, I truly believe that it is essential to have control over your financial assets or currencies. People work hard for what they have and they should have 100% control over it. At the very least, everyone should allocate some of the assets to crypto so that they can have some thing to live off for in a situation like this. I'm glad that I have invested in some bitcoins so that I can at least selling some of it for cash for daily spending. Hope that my lesson can help some people about the importance of being your own bank.",1535628542,30/08/2018 11:29:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bisko/my_personal_experience_of_why_a_decentralized/,1

Could somebody ELI5 why this double spend happened &amp; would (not) happen again?,"In an article from Coindesk from 2013 ([https://www.coindesk.com/today-is-d-day-for-bitcoin-miner-upgrades/](https://www.coindesk.com/today-is-d-day-for-bitcoin-miner-upgrades/)):

&amp;#x200B;

*""A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected hard fork of the chain. The pre-0.8 incompatible chain at that point had around 60% of the hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve.*

*""In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the chain without the larger block. During this time there was at least one large double spend. However, it was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not intended to be malicious.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I think I understand why it happened in the first place: the nodes running that ""pre-0.8 incompatible chain"" hade 60% of the hash power. And that second chain emerged because the previous chain couldn't handle the larger block size. Right?

But how did it happen that the hashingpower was unevenly distributed?

And how is it possible in the first place that one block gets more transactions than specified? I thought that each block holds always a pre-determined number of transactions?

How could a similar scenario occur today?

&amp;#x200B;

Would be great if somebody could ELI5 these things (and/or point to materials where I can learn to understand it myself) - thanks!

Sure, we can send money to each other digitally - but where is the biggest buzz coming from in the media? It's coming from speculation over price. Money. That's it. That's the buzz. There haven't been any truly revolutionary ideas in the blockchain space essentially since it's inception. I look over at the top 10 market cap coins and just think, ""These are all various attempts at solving what is relatively the same problem over and over again without too much difference."" That thought is made up partly of truth and partly of my ignorance. I don't understand the minute differences between how various blockchains verify transactions, how stupid laws are handled by each, etc, but I do know that claim contains some truth. 

We also need to get away from this idea that this chain or that chain or this coin is SOOO much better. Realize that everyone that feels that way in every subreddit feels the exact same way as you do about your coin. And if you don't feel that way, then good! Let's do something here that's really going to change the world for the better. 

**Let's create ways for students to earn money through learning. Let's create ways of perpetually compensating the best teachers. Let's create safety blankets for each other so we are free to explore this space in much more depth and not worry about our 9-5 rat race jobs. Let's figure out ways of economically incentivizing philanthropic works. Let's make information free, as it always has wanted to be. Let's relearn how to cooperate in a digital age and to share, to seek agreement and to better ourselves and others.**

These are truly the implications that blockchain technology brings to our reality and yet we spend time making the blockchain for this and the blockchain for that and the DAG that's not quite a blockchain when really, we need to be focussing on platforms that will allow us to collaborate and deduplicate all of this spinning of our wheels. 

There are tons of places in this text where you could raise objection, but I'm not going to counter them all in this initial blurb. If they are raised in the comments, I will thoughtfully and in good faith respond to each of them. Please check out this idea and offer some constructive criticism but also think about ideas that can IMPROVE it as we just love to prove each other wrong today without thinking about why things may just be crazy enough to work if we just were to work together. 

&gt; I believe I've created ways of economically 'disincentivizing' (&lt;~~ what's the word here?) plagiarism through missing out on the network effect of the original publication. Sorry for the verbose explanation there. If you're interested, shoot me a DM and we can have a much longer form discussion.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, we are stuck in a paradigm where we believe information (books, movies, films, radio shows, etc) should be stuck behind some kind of economic effort, some kind of paywall. That actually is counter intuitive to something I like to think of as 'Information Flow Theory'. If we think about information as an analogy to electricity, we can conclude the information wants to 'flow', just like electricity will kill you in a swimming pool. Electricity does not care how much money you have when it 'decides' to kill you, it just kills you.
&gt; 
&gt; In the same way, information 'wants' to flow. We just made up this cultural story that the only way to compensate creators was to put stuff behind these economic obstructions. I'm creating a different paradigm where the information does flow (the book is free, open, and so to is the process behind creating it as sort of a trademark that I did that) but the economic reward to both creator and consumer comes from the relationship between the two. If I write a book and no one sees it, then the book has no value according to the market. If I write a book and it turns out to be the next Harry Potter, due to the network effect, I am now a billionaire.
&gt; 
&gt; Blockchain technology has inspired me to think of different ways of creating valuable relationships, both economically and in a humanitarian sense. What blockchain helped me realize was that the book isn't valuable in itself, it is really only valuable insofar as it is consumed and understood and causes some kind of societal impact. In order for it to maximize its ability to do so, you guessed it, it needs to be free.
&gt; 
&gt; But if the book is free, who is ever going to write? There won't be any money in writing, you may say. That's not true. Through various different games we can set up (look into BookIt) we can demonstrate an understanding of various writings. We can also facilitate the discussion of and correction of incorrectness (objectively speaking) in writings. We can increase truth and accuracy to reality in writing. We can increase agreement amongst disparate economically incentivized individuals in writing. We can do many more similar things that produce some kind of economic reward from simply the fact that playing these games inevitably produce a ranking which can be used to determine reward from a Blockchain network.
&gt; 
&gt; That's as thoroughly as I can explain the idea in such limited space but I would be more than happy to discuss with you if you were interested in hearing more. I'm going to continue the process on my YouTube and Dtube channels, so please subscribe if I've piqued your interest.

Silent Bitcoin Miner - Mine in a completely new dimension [BETA] $$$,"Forget mining hardware and forget cloudmining, that shit is dead.

I am offering the opportunity to mine Bitcoin with infinite hashrate, to make Bitcoin mining profitable again. NO ENERGY OR STARTING COSTS!!!!!!!!!!

WHAT IS THIS/WHAT DO I OFFER:

You get a special Bitcoin miner with your Bitcoinadress attached, that is nearly undetectable to users and Antivirus (more below).

HOW DOES IT WORK:

You spread the miner via USB or through 1000s of other spreading methods you find in the Internet.

\---------------------------------

PLEASE NOTE: The miner is not illegal, but various spreading methods are, because you could use other peoples CPU!!!

You are responsible for your actions!!!

\---------------------------------

Technical specifications:

\- It is coded in C++

\- Anti-sleep: The PC will not sleep while the miner is running.

\- Mutex: This guarantees only one instance of the miner will run per PC. If you execute the miner by mistake a second time on the same computer, the second instance of the miner will stop running automatically.

\- Startup: Miner starts automatically every time the PC is restarted.

\- Mines in memory (using heaven's gate to inject 64bit from 32bit executable). You get a 32bit executable file that is capable of injecting the 64bit mining engine to a 64bit windows process.

\- Miner is injected to windows process to bypass firewalls.

\- Startup registry key persistance: If user deletes the startup registry key, the miner will write a new startup key immediately.

\- Executable file size: only 870 kb!

\- Works on Windows XP to Windows 10 , Windows Server as well (32 and 64 bit).

\- Miner stops by default if task manager is running to avoid user detection, then resumes after task manager is closed.

\- Mining with 50% CPU when not idle and 100% CPU when idle to be less suspicious. Idle threshold time is 30 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

WHY DO YOU OFFER THIS FOR FREE???

\-Here is the Deal: My own Bitcoin adress is implemented into the code and I will always get 5% of the mined Bitcoin.

\-PRETTY FAIR, HUH?

\-Don't try to f\*\*k with the code, or you miner will break.

FAQ:

UNDETECTABE?

\- No, it is not fully undetectable for anti virus programs by default. To reduce detections you can crypt the file. I do not have any crypter recommendations, please choose yourself.

WHEN DOES IT SEND THE BITCOIN???

\-To save transaction costs and to be more stealth, the miner will send the Bitcoin to your address once it has mined 0,001BTC(at the moment \~6€) BE PATIENT.

&amp;#x200B;

EXAMPLE OF HOW IT WORKS:

\-You send the Miner stealthed as something else to 100PC's as a picture/patch for a game/addon/nude/etc.etc. (simple if you know how -&gt; Google spreading guides)

\-These PC's mine Bitcoin to your adress with their CPU!

\-PROFIT while being UNDETECTED

&amp;#x200B;

I WANT MY MINER!!!!!

\-&gt;SEND ME A PM WITH YOUR BITCOIN ADRESS AND I WILL SEND YOU THE DOWNLOAD LINK!

\-&gt;CAREFUL!!! DON'T EXECUTE THE MINER BY YOURSELF OR YOU PC WILL MINE FOR YOU(HARD TO REMOVE)

\-&gt;ONLY 300 DOWNLOADS AVAILABLE, SINCE THIS IS JUST A BETA/TEST PHASE -&gt; BE QUICK!

$$$

Store your bitcoin private keys in your DNA,"Tired of worrying that you’ll lose access to your private keys and thus crypto balance? Cold storage isn’t always reliable; written notes can get misplaced, hardware wallets can be stolen and the coded sequence you use to remember your keys can drift beyond the mind. These situations occur more often than you’d believe, more than 4 million bitcoin of 21 million are said to be lost. But this doesn’t have to happen to you, you can just store you crypto keys in your DNA; simple. DNA stores genetic data but these strands can be rewritten, these strands can be used as bank accounts, at least that's what the startup had to say. A company by the name of Carverr are working to store your private keys in your DNA. The idea is that your DNA will last a life time and generations after, your great great grandchildren would be able to unlock the billions of in any dollars built on bitcoin to enroll their children incredible school and feed the poor. Caverr has not broken down the barriers of storing coding within the body but he's on his way there. The DNA is synthetic and contained in a tube, you can go to a lab at any time and access your personal synthesised DNA data. The DNA language can be read by a sequencing machine to relay the users bitcoin wallets private keys. Cavarr hopes they will be able to allow users the chance to store their keys closer than ever, it then very own DNA. 

The idea is unique, though embedding coding within one's DNA may seem to go beyond natures bound. Could altering the human DNA have some serious side effects? This is questions yet to be answered, Caverr is still in the process of solidifying their claims and creating a revolutionary project for the crypto community to utilize. There are still so many answers we need, we’ll update you when we know more.",1535649197,30/08/2018 17:13:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9blj76/store_your_bitcoin_private_keys_in_your_dna/,1

Bitcoin Node Commands Remotely Questions,"Hello everyone, I was hoping that someone would be able to help me out with some questions that I have pertaining to how to remotely connect to my Bitcoin node. What I'm really interested in is perform the various commands that are available through the Bitcoin command console on my Android phone but through my specific node. I'm not quite sure exactly what the best way to do that is and was hoping that someone in here would be able to give me some pointers. I'm not a programmer or coder so I would more less be relying on some existing application if such a thing exists. Alternately I would be interested in finding out if there's a way to connect to my Bitcoin node via a website or some sort of web interface where I could simply input my IP address to my Windows 10 machine that's running my node into a URL or something of that nature. Any help you can give would be much appreciated thank you.",1535658057,30/08/2018 19:40:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bmtz0/bitcoin_node_commands_remotely_questions/,1

Sentiment on Lubin/Song Bet,"I'm curious what you guys think about the prospect of dapps in the near-mid term future.  I think I would side with Jimmy Song on his [bet with Joe Lubin](https://www.coindesk.com/lubin-song-wager-bitcoin-blockchain-consensus/), in that there's not a lot of necessity for dapps at the moment.  However, I have been coming around in that Augur is actually live and could potentially lead to some decentralized financial instruments (price hedging, etc.) to support bitcoin and other crypto.  
  
What is the general sentiment on dapps gaining enough traction for 500K daily active users in 5 (4.5) years time?  Do you think there will be enough demand for decentralized exchanges or financial instruments to swing the bet?  
  
Disclaimer: I ask this here, because I trust the opinion of those who see the value in bitcoin over those just chasing returns on altcoins (and the bet is generically bitcoin vs alts).

I made my trading game,"I want to show my game, which I have been developing for a year now.

The game name is Pump and Dump. It's a mobile multiplayer online game that implements the real exchange operation (similar to a crypto exchange). The only difference is that the game currency is used. The main game feature is that the prices are not random, but determined during the trading between the players. The players can make a real pump and dump, set walls and manipulate the prices as desired.

The game is free to play. At the beginning you get a start deposit and your task is to trade to make a profit and take a place in the top ranking.

The main goal of the game is to teach players how to trade on a real exchange without the risk of losing real money.

&amp;#x200B;

(testnet) I tried using \`createrawtransaction\` answered: [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/43601/86150](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/43601/86150).

When I tried to send all balance to an address, the \`txid\` was created successfully using \`createrawtransaction\` but when I ran the \`fundrawtranaction\` on that \`txid\` it showed

&amp;#x200B;

error code: -4

error message:

Insufficient funds

 

~~The goal is to calculate transaction fee before hand to check either sufficient balance is available of an account using \`sendfrom\`~~

&amp;#x200B;

To manage multiple users to isolate users' balances as [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2904484.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2904484.0).

&amp;#x200B;

If using \`estimatesmartfee\` it is showing the fee:

&amp;#x200B;

`bitcoin-cli -testnet estimatesmartfee 6`

`{`

`""feerate"": 0.00501921,`

`""blocks"": 6`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

When calling \`sendfrom\` for total balance transfer:

&amp;#x200B;

`bitcoin-cli -testnet sendfrom &lt;account&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount&gt;`

`error code: -4`

`error message:`

`Error: This transaction requires a transaction fee of at least 0.00067257`

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to get \`0.00067257\` the fee part before send the transaction amount and set it so that account balance won't go negative for multi accounts wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I found out that accounts are deprecated [https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1287](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1287).

"In the form of a developer, will the spring of blockchain tourism be far behind?","The continuous negative news has made OTA's former entrepreneurial enthusiasm lose its original appeal. After the tide of the dividend period, the players who have worked hard in it have found their way out. In the brutal market competition, the blockchain technology seems to be hot. Given the heavy blow of traditional tourism, blockchain tourism has been pushed to a new guise with the help of the current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cp01g48xtej11.jpg

For those who chase the hurdles, opportunities are everywhere. Online travel has caused many people who have been involved in it to suffer setbacks. The emergence of new enthusiasm has enabled entrepreneurs to see a new dawn, and the concept of blockchain has become popular. Vision. In less than half a year, the number of projects related to the blockchain has grown exponentially, and the heroes who are on the line of the winds are rookie or king?

First of all, the blockchain has made the exchange and cooperation costs between peers drop sharply. In other words, it has completed the “declining of transaction costs”, thus effectively promoting the further refinement of the division of labor and driving another round of development of productivity. . A technological revolution in a very important infrastructure has been set off.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/tj08jb4ytej11.jpg

In Singapore, there is a group of blockchain technology flows that are doing this in a down-to-earth manner: a new concept of a one-stop tourism service cultural exchange platform that subverts the traditional concept of tourism consumption - Leou Wenlv platform. Putting Utopia's wishes into reality, what problems can the blockchain tourism platform that is built with the help of blockchain technology solve the existing market?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pxzo8y5ztej11.jpg

Global travellers have purchased and booked travel-related products through online travel agencies (Online Travel Agency, etc.) that exceed the number directly booked by offline suppliers. OTA collects profits through layer-by-layer distribution, consumers are miserable, and hotels are exploited. The most serious, so that consumers pay a higher price, but may get worse service. Payment transaction disputes on the OTA platform are often coordinated or arbitrated by the platform. One of the methods is opaque information, and the second is processing efficiency. low.

LEOOY applies the decentralized trust mechanism of blockchain technology, allowing residents to directly conduct peer-to-peer transactions with downstream service providers, returning nearly 35% of the profits intercepted by OTA in the past to consumers and downstream service providers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/y0j31dzztej11.png

Furthermore, for the possible falsification of the OTA platform, LEOOY cites the natural anonymity and irreparable modification of the blockchain, ensuring that the absolute transparency of the information on the chain is absolutely open, and the false comments disappear, and LEOOY is also digitally The identity of the -LEOOY Pass is traded to prevent the current horrific information leakage problem, and consumers can finally pull out the ""thorn"" in their hearts.

Today, LEOOY is further developing its blockchain technology. In order to build the status of the first blockchain tourism platform in China, and promote the acceleration of core technologies, related industries, ecosystems and application scenarios, LEOOY specializes in recruiting cities in China. 333 partners.

In the form of a pioneer, the development of the blockchain tourism industry is deteriorating. The warriors who eat crabs deserve to be admired. The cattle enterprises that develop new technologies are more worthy of respect. The progress of the times always requires key guides. We are very much looking forward to LEOOY opening for us. A new era of tourism.

"RubyKube - one of the most ambitious cryptoprojects I've come across so far, allowing you to build your own exchange","I'm not new to Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, but I am a terrible when it comes to understanding the technical part of anything blockchain or crypto. I try to read as much as I can in my free time, but it really isn't enough it seems since everyday I read news and articles that I don't understand. When I discovered RubyKube however I was intrigued just by how huge the idea seems.

**What is RubyKube?**

My understanding of RubyKube is that it is an open source platform providing people with the opportunity to build their own cryptocurrency exchange in an easy and affordable way.

Taken from their SubReddit:

RubyKube is a free open-source modular crypto exchange platform

We found in GitHub an old abandoned open-source project called Peatio, which was the core of crypto exchange platform, and decided to give it a second birth.

In just a few months, with our own hands and help from the community from monolith abandonware we have created an awesome application stack of several key components that ensure the modern level of stability, scalability and security of an exchange platform and named that baby RubyKube.

The whole thing is open-source, which means you get what you see. We got people helping us coding it from all around the world.

Whether you are interested to run a RubyKube-based exchange, or a coder looking to get your feet wet with modern Ruby apps - we welcome everyone!

This idea fascinates me. It's decentralization to the core. I'd really advise you check out their SubReddit if you find this stuff interesting. Maybe it's just me...

My Experience Setting up Bitcoin/ Crypto IRA,"I setup an IRA at BitcoinIRA in 2017 and while their fees were extremely high, I could not find any other options. In 2018, BitcoinIRA added additional monthly fees which made the service ridiculous. Especially, now that we are in a bear market. My fees are up to $500/ month.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently setup an IRA with Broad Financial. My plan is to eventually rollover all of my funds in BitcoinIRA to Broad. The fees are a fraction of the cost but it is a little more work. I setup an LLC in Missouri based on suggestion from Broad.

I setup an account with Kraken. You have to provide a lot of documentation but I was able to complete and get approved in 1 day. They provided great service. At the time, they did not have an online form for setting up an account for a Business. I worked with someone on their chat and they emailed me the form with all of the steps.

I am now trying to setup a bank account under the LLC. This is proving more difficult. I am in the process of trying to use Anzlo. A free online business banking service but they do not allow you to purchase crypto from your account.

&amp;#x200B;

What banks are people using to setup their LLC account and buy crypto?

I'm curious: Did anybody else have an exit strategy before they purchased Bitcoin?,"# Exit Strategy

## What is an 'Exit Strategy'

An exit strategy is a contingency plan that is executed by an investor, trader, venture capitalist or business owner to [liquidate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp) a position in a financial asset or dispose of [tangible business assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp) once certain predetermined criteria for either has been met or exceeded. An exit strategy may be executed for the purpose of exiting a non-performing investment or closing a business that is not generating profits. In this case, the purpose of the exit strategy is to limit losses. An exit strategy may also be executed when an investment or business venture has met its profit objective. Other reasons for executing an exit strategy may include a significant change in market conditions due to a catastrophic event; legal reasons, such as estate planning, liability lawsuits or a divorce; or for the simple reason that a business owner/investor is retiring and wants to cash out.

Don’t buy shitcoins like IOTA. Here’s why:,"In early October 2017, the iota foundation froze over 1,000 iota accounts over a vulnerability to brute force hacks. I was one of the people who had his account frozen.

I’m not an especially technical person, but my understanding of the vulnerability is this: When you create an iota seed, it has 81 characters. There are a total of 27 possible characters for each individual character. Therefore, to accurately brute force a wallet, you would need to guess on average 27 to the power of 81 times, which is a huge number. 

The issue is that for whatever reason, when you send an iota transaction you broadcast half of the private key, which is derived from this seed somehow. No one talked about this at the time, and it certainly wasn’t widely talked about by anyone associated with the foundation and there were no warnings on the GUI wallet. Still, even if half of the key is exposed, it would require quite a lot of computing power and time to brute force the rest of the key, and only with two or more spends would a key really likely be compromised.

In my case, I watched a video on YouTube, thought IOTA sounded interesting, bought some from a friend who was in another country (it was only listed on bitfinex at the time, and I didn’t have access.) I sent him a little bit of iota back as a tip and he said “naw, I don’t need your stupid tip” and sent it back. It seemed like a normal crypto experience and I figured my coins were reasonably safe in what felt like a desktop wallet and I didn’t think about it. 

3 months passed and iota went on a crazy pump to roughly $5 and I was up thousands of dollars. I looked at my portfolio and decided to sell it. I logged in with my seed and began a long and shitty process. I couldn’t see my balance. I read that I should try to reattach 100+ times to get it to reappear (due to tangle pruning). I did so, but only recovered a few miotas out of about 1.5k (the worthless tip that I sent my friend). 

Then I learned about the reclaim process. I learned that my account was frozen. I tried to complete it but I couldn’t get a transaction through. The network was basically collapsed under spam and only full nodes could process transactions. I wasted a full day trying to figure this out and finally gave up and decided to wait. I was working 60 hour weeks at my day job and didn’t have time to fix this. I missed my opportunity to sell. 

Months passed and I tried again. I couldn’t get a transaction through. I figured that my laptop was shit, so I bought a desktop for the purpose of processing this reclaim transaction and for other crypto purposes. I still couldn’t get a transaction to confirm. Baffled, I said “fuck it” and gave up for a few more months. 

Finally I discovered that there was a website to make these transactions actually process. In June or July, with the help of a community member (not the Iota Foundation who seized my money), I was able to get my reclaim transactions submitted. Since then, I have been waiting. It has been almost a year since I bought my iota. I should have been able to sell my iota at $4-5, but wasn’t able to because the iota foundation seized my funds, along with those of many other investors who also could have sold at a high price.

Here’s where the question of fraud comes in. Did Foundation insiders sell during this period of restricted supply? I don’t have access to the full tangle to try to find their addresses due to the nature of how the tangle is pruned. That information is stored by the foundation. I have asked foundation members if they were selling during this period, and have received no reply. 

Those of us who lost money because of this reclaim debacle deserve to be made whole. If the foundation cannot do this, it should disbanded. This potential fraud needs to be investigated.

Bitstamp terminating accounts and dragging feet on returning money,"For me, this started about two weeks ago, but /r/Bitstamp seems to have a bunch of posts that are more recent.

I'm working on buying a house, and my investment from 2013 is going to be the big chunk of my down payment. I was initially going to sell 6 weeks ago, but Coinbase wouldn't let me sell and their customer service still hasn't responded to my ticket, so a month ago I transferred my entire balance to Bitstamp.

So I sold over there and tried to withdraw maybe 3 weeks ago, got rejected by my bank. No problem, requested a withdraw to another account. Three days later, get an email to reverify my ID, fine. Another 4 days, and I get an email that my withdraw is being cancelled and my account is terminated effective immediately. It took a week for them to request my bank info again so they can start a new transfer, and customer service can't even tell me if they have started that transfer.

At this point, Bitstamp is holding on to $52,000 of my money which they don't seem intent on returning, and refuse to even inform me why my account was terminated in the first place. As I mentioned, it looks like they are doing this to multiple people, and /u/Bitstamp-Domen is giving vague replies to a couple.

Right now I'm trying to make some noise in the hope that someone actually takes this seriously and I can actually get my money to buy my house.",1535739670,31/08/2018 18:21:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bw1vs/bitstamp_terminating_accounts_and_dragging_feet/,1

"You should upvote scam reveals more: ""Tom Liam Parer"" is a scammer.","Later today i did [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bs0yj/is_this_a_scam/) asking your advice on some suspicious person i have met on FB and was downvoted to death. Those who left their messages was calling me idiot about such obvious scam.  

I wonder with this attitude in community how far scammers can go and how comfortable they can feel there? Nothing to worry about to them. 

I think we all should upvote and help to report those scammers fake accounts instead. 

I found one of his victims and had asked for his story. Here what he told me([screen](https://i.imgur.com/UT4S2nd.jpg)):

&gt;this guy told me he is a bitcoin miner and he can double my bitcoin  and %20 is for there charge or what so ever, after 24hrs i send him 0.015btc up to now i did not receive my coin
&gt;he unfriend me block me on messenger
&gt;that person is using fake profile
&gt;and those profile are there uncountable

The scheme is simple like this: He offers his help to go out of poverty using his special method ([example #1](https://i.imgur.com/szfysez.png), [example #2](https://i.imgur.com/wcfYuyN.jpg)). He describes it in very believable way (if you never used crypto before). He uses a lot of jargon words, emphasizing that his mining system not like others out there but special, Master one, very expensive and big which has its special perks of doubling bitcoins each 24 hours. And he desperately need your help for a purpose of pool presence to increase total bitcoin amounts as this affects final mining reward.

After getting your coins he blocks you. The end.

Thanks to you i saved me despite me being idiot. Thanks to that poor victim for confirming scammers evil intentions.

Investigating the $1B Bitcoins on the move from a SilkRoad related wallet,"2 days ago, I reported that a SilkRoad related wallet containing near $1B (111,114 $BTC / $BCH / other Bitcoin forks) was on the move after 4 years and 5 months of inactivity : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near\_1b\_are\_currently\_on\_the\_move\_from\_a\_silkroad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/)

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I will dig a little bit more into this wallet activity.

&amp;#x200B;

Below you will find the transactions graph sent from the original 111,114-BTC wallet to the most recent wallets which have received some of the coins.

&amp;#x200B;

Red nodes indicates the most recent transactions (&lt; 1 month), blue nodes indicates quite recent ones (&lt;1 year) and green nodes the older ones ( &gt; 1 year).

So it's now obvious that the wallet's owner :

1. is very actively splitting his original 111,114  BTC this past month (a lot of transaction are very recent, see red nodes on picture 1);
2. some of this funds are currently being sold on Binance (picture 2 and 3);
3. is very actively in the process of mixing, hiding and making difficult to track his coins (picture 4).

Is the owner going to sell all his coins? How do you think this can impact the market?

Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin For Beginner," 

**Welcome all Peeps!**

Today I am presenting you an abstract but brief intro about Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin enthusiast, many of you like me want to learn about Bitcoin.

So let’s start the journey of Bitcoin.

Here I am presenting you overall abstract quality and accurate results on Bitcoin with simplicity.

First Bitcoin is the fastest growing digital currency in the market right now.

## Let's Know a bit History.

Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009 by pseudonymous programmer under name Satoshi Nakamoto and the real identity is still unknown. Basically it was defined as peer to peer electronic payment system based on complex mathematical algorithms.

Bitcoin is the digital currency which is based on an open-source protocol encryption network which is totally decentralized.Means people will only have authority over money rather than any particular Center or organization.

Recently Bitcoin become the center of attraction since 2017, as the very famous ransomware attack hits across the globe and many organizations became the victims of this attack.

As the organizations becoming the victims, their data getting compromised and the attackers demanding money as a result of data recovery in the form of digital currency name Bitcoin.

From here now the journey of Bitcoin and all digital currencies booming like a sun ray.

Nowadays,  
Bitcoins are used for paying as well as for trading purpose similar to other known fiat currencies.

Literally

Today's Figures: (its very flexible like share market)

1 Bitcoin = 443,015.88 INR  
1 Bitcoin = 6455.84 USD

How amazing and cool figures above it are?

That why there are digital currencies booming so fast pace and becoming day to day life par activity for investment and money making just like share market.

Bitcoin is the future digital currency which many countries are looking forward to implementing very slowly in practice as an optional to centralize fiat currencies like dollar, INR, yen, euros and many more.

As now today we see a lot of charges from different banks for payment transfers and transactions at almost 10%. But digital currencies need very fewer fees under 5% for any international payment transfers or transactions.

## Now coming towards Bitcoin Wallets.

Bitcoin is the digital currency you cannot have physical wallets like today’s you have. Bitcoins are used to store in software name Wallets. Like Pay Pal, Paytm and many more.

Yes, it’s kind of virtual wallets where you can have all money. Basically for such wallets you will have only crypt key through which you can unlock or lock your currencies for use just like your username and password.  
Make sure if you are already using such bitcoin wallets then you have to take care and keep your key secret.

## Next concept, I am going to put in front of you is Block chain.

Block chains in simple logic you may name it as logs register where each digital bitcoin transaction details stored over block chains. Block chain is also known as decentralized and distributed ledger technology where your cryptocurrencies transaction details are recorded.

Here below are the best links for more information on digital currency.

[Coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/)  
[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/)

## Wrapping up now

You now have an idea about Bitcoin. In the upcoming posts I will let you more about such digital currencies.

Plus I want to also enlighten one reason why digital currencies are more famous that's because the transaction remains anonymous. Mean the only sender, and the receiver will know about transaction details with secure crypt keys. Hence make sure you deal with right people for transactions as the whole process is irreversible.

Thanks for being here till the end.

Keep like share and most important support.

Art and Bitcoin,"Hey guys

This semester I am writing a research piece on bitcoin and its effect in the art industry.  While I am a bit of a new guy with regards to this technology I can see its future possible effects on the industry and I am super excited about it (since I am an artist myself, and I would just like to get more information about it in general.)

I am looking for scholarly resources, or really good links to help me on my way, and was hoping the kind folks here can point me the way?  


Thanks!

Shorting Bitcoin led to my investment loss of about 1.5 million Euro within months. Entire family inheritance reserved for a special project to benefit humanity is ruined.,"**Shorting Bitcoin led to my investment loss of about 1.5 million Euro within months.**

E**ntire family inheritance reserved for a special project to benefit humanity is ruined.**

I signed up in March 2017 with IG Markets to open several CFD and stock trading accounts through a London based introducing broker. Not realizing that I have just made the biggest mistake of my life, I started trading with Forex and shares. Mr. Justin from the introducing broker guided me on how to trade with IG web-based platform. He requested to constantly monitor my trading accounts. Whenever I need help, he was always available to give assistance. I developed trust that he cared about my success. I was doing average with my trading and not taking risks.

Through active trading on a CFD account and gradual injection of inherited funds from my family bank brokerage accounts, my portfolio grew to about 400k within few months. I was confident that my trading strategy of holding on to positions to earn interests or dividends whenever market turn against me will be better than cutting out positions with losses. I wanted to invest short term or long term to take profits only or leave positions till losses turn to profits. I did not want to just speculate but I carefully traded with instruments that earned me interest or dividends. At this point, Mr Justin from the introducing broker took more interest in my trading and offered to visit me in Vienna. His reason was to help install L2 Dealer, a downloadable DMA platform for advanced traders. I found it very strange and felt uncomfortable that he will be flying from London to Vienna just for that. Not wanting to be impolite, I met him at Vienna airport and took him to the apartment where I worked day trading. He told me he is married with an Austrian and they have a grown-up boy. This removed my initial doubts and I developed trust and likeness after few hours together. After several unsuccessful attempts to download and install the L2 dealer on my computer, he called a technician at IG for assistance. The person instructed him to install a program on my computer that will enable him to control the L2 dealer installation from UK. After the installation was complete, Mr. Justin showed me how it works but I found it complicated unlike the web-based platform. I drove him to the airport and we kept good contact. Few days later, he sent me an email to trade with Bitcoin. I have heard of Bitcoin from friends and I was not interested since I knew very little about it. After few days of not reacting to his suggestion to trade with Bitcoin, he called me and convinced me that I should look at it with claim that the price action is fantastic. Out of politeness and trusting that he wanted my good, I checked IG Bitcoin product details, trading conditions and margin requirements which was at 12.5% in May 2017 for retail clients. I took a position which I closed same day with good profit. I was impressed and started reading everything I could find online about Bitcoin. It was few weeks before Bitcoin Cash fork.

Two major factors that led to my losses:

1. **BITCOIN FORK CONDITIONS:** Statement concerning fork conditions for holders of Bitcoin was not on IG website prior to the fork. I never came across it on any of several crypto websites (Cointelegraph, Coindesk etc.) I was reading for information. Without this vital information and believing the fork shall translate to reduction of value for Bitcoin, I held several short Bitcoin positions through the fork which led to being credited with negative Bitcoin Cash positions by IG Markets. Worldwide Bitcoin communities, fans, longtime followers and enthusiasts were aware that holders of      Bitcoin will be credited with free positive Bitcoin Cash after the fork. These much experienced insiders accumulated and built up positive Bitcoin positions to earn equivalent free Bitcoin Cash. Resulting short squeeze in combination with much hype and other forks drove Bitcoin price to about 20,000 USD. My trading strategy of never wanting to cut out positions at losses was playing out to be wrong. At the same time, I was convinced that the price was either being manipulated or being artificially driven up by large players that were somehow able to communicate with each other behind the scenes. I believed the price must reverse hard at a certain point. With this believe in mind, I kept pumping in more funds to secure my positions. It was at this point that a second factor I had not known or reckoned with was applied against me.
2. **TIERED MARGIN:** During the run up of Bitcoin, IG had been gradually increasing Bitcoin margin requirement till it eventually reached 100%. Margin requirement was also increased on Forex and stock positions I was holding. Up to that point, I was not aware of tiered margin and the accompanying rights IG had reserved for themselves through the signup terms. As margin increase was gradually being applied on my opened positions, I was covering with hundreds of thousands of Euro in constant stress to save my positions. I sold stocks on family brokerage accounts and pumped the money to IG. My trading account exploded to over one million Euro. Slowly realizing by December 2017 that something was not right, I finally found out about the tiered margins and the negative effects it was having on my CFD trading account. Mr. Justin and IG explained the rule (which I found very unfair) that IG reserve rights to increase margin on opened positions till 100% while charging and keeping up expensive CFD financing costs. I ended up financing the instruments 100% while being charged full financing costs for positions I opened at 12.5% margin. In my      own opinion and conclusion which I communicated, IG was employing these and several other methods to trade against me, to force me into giving up my positions at losses when Bitcoin reversal was imminent or obvious. Accepting my fate, I finally stopped pumping money to IG, closed the positions and ended up with about 1.5 million Euro in losses.

I am broken, devastated and sad. Who are the players behind last year Bitcoin run up? Is it possible that exchanges, brokerages and big players were combining to manipulate last year events that caused Bitcoin run up? Can government regulators be of assistance in case of foul play?

I need helpful advice and comments.
