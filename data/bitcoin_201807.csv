for he saw the foreseen without potion

Unfortunate true, as the young man he knew

That all would be cured through Satoshin

Then gloomier times were suppressed

Fell the thieves, banksters and unrest

They all joined in the fun, until all came undone

But then true of the Q came their test

When the Year of the Dog comes to pass

and three, six and nine come to grasp

No more jumping, yes true, but what else could they do

Lehman Bros failed us all way too fast

Now, the question in mind, like that sign in the Times

could he possibly still be alive?

Bitcoin and game theory,"Hi, I have read a few articles about 51 percent attacks and that bitcoin is secure from these due to there being no rewards for anyone to do so.

This seems flawed to me, surely if someone could openly or covertly manipulate a 51 percent attack then they could at least in the short term make a big profit. 

Now my point is not that a 51 percent attack is easy it is more that it might have a big reward if done well. Can one give me an example of a malicous action and how bitcoin provides no incentive for doing it?

Most crypto-friendly US banks? (And a couple of other questions).,"Hi, I'm moving to the USA this August to study a Master's in Washington DC. I have heard many stories of people getting their bank accounts frozen for transferring money to exchanges, so I was wondering... which banks do you think are the best if I plan to send money to an exchange regularly? I want to get a job on my free time and that money will mostly go to crypto, so one transaction every two weeks or every month (depending how often I get paid) is very likely to occur.

And yes, although I would love to not have to open a bank account, it's still a must in order to pay the university and the rent (at least). I hope future international students will be able to use their bitcoin's wallet for all of this :)

Oh, and another question: do you recommend to carry my Ledger Nano S on my hand luggage or on my checked baggage. I know US officials can be very strict on immigration, so they may ask me to unlock it for them or something? I guess carrying it on my checked baggage will pose no problem, right?

And finally, I also have a piece of paper with all my exchange account passwords written on it (they are super large and weird so I can't remember all of them). I'm afraid to carry it with me because it might get picked up on the scanner and someone may read it. I know, I'm a bit too paranoid but still. Do you think folding it so that the written side is hidden will be enough? I hope so because I'm not willing to store it on my checked baggage, where it could be open and read without me even knowing. I keep most of my cryptos on my Ledger Nano S, but some withdrawal fees are just criminal, and because I don't have much money to begin with, it isn't worth it to move some of them to my ledger.

Why do financial regulators need to learn their lessons with Bitcoin the hard way?,"2008-2018 debt crisis has positioned Greece among those EU states (together with Spain, Italy and Cyprus), which financial gate-keepers had publicly revealed their inability to face the challenges of the new, open, technology-based XXI century's economy. Additionally, Greek banking system near-collapse in 2015 led to the astronomical surge of crypto-currencies' popularity.

Greece authorities' long-lasting reliance on EU fractional-reserve, highly centralized banking system led to the complete unraveling of country's financial markets. National debt skyrocketed and international creditors shut their doors to Greek's counterparts. The government reacted by trying to postpone June 2015 installment to IMF. Massive panic ensued with population racing to empty their banks' accounts. In response Syriza's cabinet introduced capital control regime, which limited withdraws to 120 EUR per week. No wonder, then, that so many Greeks saw the light those days and started to convert their savings into Bitcoins.

It came to the point where Tsipras cabinet closely considered an option to use Bitcoin as the anti-austerity measure. That didn't happen, however, but, thanks to this crisis Bank of Greece position on crypto-currencies became significantly less hawkish, compare to that of their EU mates. When BOG issued its first, February 11, 2014 memorandum on Bitcoin it turned out that its content and wording are both measured and thoughtful.

This positive trend was reinforced in February 2018, when BOG stated the following: ""Given that virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, are still at the forefront of publicity and with a view to informing the public of the risks associated with their use, including the loss of money, the Bank of Greece refers to the recent Communication from the European Banking Authority (EBA)."". It easy to see how this type of matter-of-fact statements is more professional than FUD spread by many other EU central bankers.

Notwithstanding, it hasn't yet led to the massive adaption of crypto by Greek population. Neither it resulted in Bitcoin to be declared a legal tender in this country. Greece official position on crypto is, still, the caution one, and it's unlikely to change without the consent of the ECB. Meanwhile, Bitcoin stays in a gray, ""unregulated"" zone in Greece.

I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.""

Change POW algorithm!,"Blockchain was supposed to be trustless. Since when is *trusting* Bitmain not to do a double spend attack trustless? 

I'm not saying they are going to do that, as they are not economically incentivized to do that *for now*. 
I'm saying we shouldn't even remotely be in the position to be having to think of it as being a possibility.

Change POW to something only CPUs and GPUs can mine. There are solutions for that where ASICs and FPGA couldn't be produced with an efficiency margin (check RandomJS, ProgPOW &amp; Merkle Tree Proof POW algos). 
In the most likely case they'd even be worse since Bitmain has no chance of competing with Intel IP and others. They are only good at producing ASICs, which is also a huge burden on ecologic footprint, because they are obsolete after a year and you literally can't use them for anything afterwards. A GPU or CPU doesn't have huge efficiency gains year to year. Therefore much longer usable and better for the environment too.

Don't forget decentralisation either...

Bitcoin will have much more inherent value if it's truly decentralized, as it is more secure then and there isn't a big Chinese corporation in control of it.

"Trying to start BTC mining, nothing works no matter what I do","Hi, I'm trying to start Bitcoin Mining with my gaming pc to get a little bit of money over the summer (I'm not expecting much, I'd be happy with just a bit and not having my parents know) but no matter what I do, everything errors or nothing happens. I mined with Nicehash for a couple of hours and it did work, then I found out that it's not a good idea to mine with them for multiple reasons, so I stopped. I'm trying to mine in Slush's Pool as I am new to Bitcoin Mining but all miners fail. My rig is a GTX 970 paired with an i7-4790K so it should be perfectly capable of making a little bit at least.
As I am in the UK I'm trying to mine to stratum+tcp://eu.stratum.slushpool.com:3333 but this is what happens with each miner. Apologies if I am trying to mine with miners based on AMD GPUs, after trying all these I heard that there's separate miners for Nvidias, AMDs and ASICs but I'm not sure if that's true because I am really new.

cgminer: Just gonna post this, bit too long to explain http://i.prntscr.com/ryWtgXPlSKu_NphqonBF6w.png and the config file says https://pastebin.com/fipMCZbz

EasyMiner: Kinda worked but I stopped because it said it was mining LTC instead of BTC and I didn't know how to direct it to my wallet

cudaminer: I don't even know it looks fine for like 1 second then just spams loads of errors like this for example (I noticed it gives some sort of directory and well it is running on my secondary hard drive but not in that directory?) http://i.prntscr.com/G5bYYdvWS_KHPmOhw8A7tQ.png batch file: https://pastebin.com/z8EXqfsq

GUIminer: Nothing happens, everything gets set correctly and yes I am aware of having to manually put in the host after it got changed and then having to manually put it in but it still doesn't work http://i.prntscr.com/_cnNOIaBSmyunNFar6cl_A.png

ccminer: The only one that doesn't error and it looks like it's mining (or I think it does anyway), but still does nothing. I monitored the GPU and CPU and no load, and the dashboard says it's doing nothing. http://i.prntscr.com/tR4Z687BS-_WapJSaGc8XQ.png batch file: https://pastebin.com/fyPxteBY

Does anybody know why this is happening? Do I need to use a specific mining software or change some of the settings or switch pools? Everything I do doesn't work and I have no idea why the hell it doesn't. I've followed every guide on youtube and nothing. Thanks for any help.

How safe is Bitcoin?," Bitcoin is well known for its safety. The biggest dangers are mainly hacker attacks on third party services, through which one accesses his bitcoins. These are above all the various crypto exchanges on which the users have created accounts or the bitcoins stored locally in wallets.   


Basically, either the exchange itself is directly attacked, so that data can be stolen there. The biggest known incident was the hacker attack on Mt.Gox about 4 years ago, when a huge hack of Bitcoins was looted. This was also the reason for the decrease of Bitcoins 2014.  


Today, the exchanges have improved to prevent such occurrences, because it can come to hacks and the trade is severely restricted or even stopped completely. This often leads to strong price fluctuations, mainly caused by so-called panic sells.  


An equally large attack surface offer individual mistakes that can easily be prevented. Individual mistakes are the responsibility of individual users and are often:  
\- insufficiently secured user accounts due to weak passwords  
\- Login on a phishing site  
\- send the private keys to a scammer  


If a stranger has once gained access to your own accounts, he can quickly transfer the entire balance to another wallet and due to the anonymity, it is no longer clearly comprehensible. For such a kind of total loss helps therefore only a careful handling with your personal user data.  


But as long as you follow to the usual security rules and pay attention to secure passwords, which you should also change from time to time and do not use the same password on many other pages, an accident normally cannot happen.  
The high demand and high competition between exchanges has also contributed to the improvement of safety standards.

I think I have burned a couple mBTC,"I think I have burned a few Satoshi,

I have used Nicehash at first in December with an external wallet I’ve created with Electrum Wallet. But after a while, I realized that Nicehash would pay my proceeds only when I’ve reached 0.1BTC and that was projected to take me 3 months back then.

I decided to take the loss and suck it up, it was worth a couple of day of mining at most when I started to assemble my rig, so it wasn’t full steam yet, still worth 20ish euro back then. I started mining to an internal wallet from NH were I could control to send my BTC when I wanted and sooner than 0.1 BTC.

Later, I haven’t used my external wallet yet to collect my mining proceed from the internal wallet to the external wallet like I intended and a security issue in the version of Electrum I had was found. Electrum urged its user to create a new wallet right this seconds and move the funds from the old wallet to another.

I updated Electrum, created a new wallet, but to be sure I didn’t screw up and send BTC to a potentially compromised wallet in the future, I’ve deleted the old wallet and destroyed the paper copy of the seed. There was no BTC to transfert in it anyway.

Today, I’m looking on my phone browser the status of my Nicehash mining and I saw the bookmark to my old wallet. I always though it went back to zero because that was too long I haven’t mined to it and Nicehash took the dust because of it.

Still don’t know why but today I decide to put the BTC address into a blockexplorer and it looks like Nicehash did pay me afterall !

https://blockexplorer.com/address/1Ckyh7SrVpCTvTfgggmyPiNFs7zFwAX2U9

But I don’t have my wallet anymore and I’ve destroyed the seed of it. Basically I don’t have access to those Satoshi anymore.

I hope Bitcoin won’t be worth a gazillion Euro in the future and make these lost Satoshi worth a life changing amount of money or I would be kind of sad. 

It’s not worth much at the moment but still now with the decrease of profitability it’s almost a couple of day of hashing away for me and I would like to have them.

I’ll look around in my study if I don’t have a double of the seed somewhere. I remember I’ve schredded it and there was only one or two paper version of it.

I think I’ll frame the QR code of the wallet to remind me how stupid I am.

"Is it too late to trust? (A discussion on ""helping Bitcoin"")","Almost a decade of existence.

Saturation of the idea is worldwide.

I feel like we have to increase our scrutiny for services offering to ""help"" ""provide security"" or ""improve Bitcoin""

There are a lot of groups with varying levels of interest that would benefit from ""helping""

It seems there is a new ""Bitcoin"" anonymity service or ""Better Wallet!"" every other day now.

I have a difficult time pruning legit from fake, and I've been here since 2010.

Can newcomers really deal with the garbage dump of bad advice and fraud services?

Even after the events of last year, the primary Bitcoin fork has come under scrutiny and varying forms of social attacks.

Sometimes, I feel like I need to learn the source code, just to be able to double check and trust it, myself.

Is there a legitimate and reliable way to test or check the validity of new ""Bitcoin"" information? Who is ensuring what's trustworthy? Can we share and discuss methods and resources for making sure something is safe? (Can this ever really be done enough? I feel like Bitcoin safety tips are necessary every day.)

Can the random number be brute forced?,"So I've been looking into the low level workings of ECDSA and am getting a bit lost.

According to the PS3 hack release, they define:
R=(mG)
Where R is part of the signature, m is the random number and G is a parameter.
As R is public, and so is G, could the value r be brute forced guessed and then matched against the value of R.

Once found it could then be used to find the private key.

So I suppose it's 2 questions,
Is this possible?
And what's the possibility? Still 2^256?

Bonus question, what's the difference between the private key and random number, as some sources state they are both created the same way (point on a curve) and some state completely different ",1530471209,01/07/2018 18:53:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vc44a/can_the_random_number_be_brute_forced/,1
Data center Bacloud starts an acceptance of Bitcoin payments throught the Lightning Network,[removed],1530471250,01/07/2018 18:54:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vc4c7/data_center_bacloud_starts_an_acceptance_of/,1
Data center Bacloud starts an acceptance of Bitcoin payments throught the Lightning Network,"         Lithuanian data center www.bacloud.com is starting to accept Bitcoin payments through the Lightning Network ( LN ) for all data center services like dedicated servers, VPS hosting, domains registration, etc. LN is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although it is still at it’s early stages and more suitable for advanced technical users, LN is, with no doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network.

Cheaf Commercial Officer of Bacloud data center Andrius Petkus tells:

	We understand the importance of going step by step with technologies and offer our customer's instant domain registrations or instant other services. Customers do not like to wait until the payment will be confirmed by miners, they like to get and use services straight away. We always get many questions, such as: why payment was not applied to invoice, when our customers will get services activated, etc. It helps to eliminate long confirmation procedure and Bitcoin currency may be used as a day to day cash payments using Lightning Network.

	Bacloud uses www.coingate.com services for merchants to accept Bitcoin and more than 50 crypto currencies. Our clients are very happy with their payment processor, it is very easy to use. We started to use CoinGate to accept Altcoin payments only, but our clients saw the benefits and naturally switched to pay Bitcoin bills using their system. Every month we have thousands of payments, never had any issues with their system. LN is a next step, We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the development of Lightning Network.

**Why is Lightning Network exciting?**

As a second layer solution, LN brings a number of improvements to Bitcoin as a currency and protocol:
*1. Thousand-fold increase in network capacity (transactions per second).
*2. Network confirmations no longer needed to trust incoming transactions.
*3. Trustless crypto-to-crypto trades, called Atomic Swap.
*4. Improved privacy: only senders and recipients can see transactions.
*5. Micro-, pico- and nano-transactions, as small as 1/1000 of a Satoshi.
*6. Potential for real-time trading directly from a controlled wallet.

	Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon first proposed the Lightning Network in a 2015 white paper as a solution built on Bitcoin. The goal of the network is to make bitcoin more of a day-to-day currency that can be useful for daily trade and micropayments.

Searching for someone who can donate 5 bitcoins,"Hello there and thank you for reading this message,

I know I'll get a lot of hate comments on, but I am determined enough to ask it anyways. I have ambitious goals and dreams and although I want to keep myself anonymous, I decide to talk to myself about what I want. 

First of all, I am a dancer and choreographer and want to become the best and give workshops all over the world. Also, I want to choreographe for artist in Asia, since I love Japan when I was three years old. Aside from that I also want to become a mangaka (which is a Japanese cartoon artist) to entertain and inspire people as well. A mangaka is very though to combine with dancing, but with a lot of research, I can organize my schedule very good. 

I am not a great drawer, but I have a great fantasy and know that if I put in the work with drawing, I can become one. I also have the talent for dancing, because I worked so hard everyday at the dance academy. 

Last year, I went depressed, because I couldn’t achieve my goals and I became in a big debt, because of a dance school that paid me 2/3 months late, as I was a teacher for the school. I had to pay of course for the bills, but ignored them, because I wanted to take risk of showing myself international workshops and become better. 

I tried to earn money with affiliate marketing, but it didn’t work and have zero money to do anything. I have a mother at home who let me stay and eat and I am grateful for that. So what my point is that in order to pay my bills and invest in my goals, I would like an amount that keep me safe for at least 4 months. After that, I know I will earn more money and have the life I want. I even purchased the book Think and Grow Rich on how to become successful in life. 

I know I can do this, but I need an amount to keep me safe so that I can learn more and do things that get me the results I want. If I can’t get the amount I want for it, I have to postpone again for at least a year and I don’t want that. The amount I want is 5BTC, but if you don’t want to donate 5BTC, you can also donate 1BTC and if you don't want to, that's okay, I understand. Why bitcoin? Because the transaction between bitcoins and my bankaccount is very fast and that's convienent for me.

What will I do after I achieve my goals? Well I also have a goal that I will help people with money problems who want to achieve there goals, but can’t, because of the money.  Also, I have more things I want to achieve in life, so life doesn’t get boring.

Thank you for reading all this and I wish you a nice day.

If the payment processor is using the LN and someone wishes to convert every purchase, that person would have to pay a fee to settle their balance for every purchase which means they'd be paying a fee every time just like normal on chain transactions?

[Article] When is the next bitcoin halving?,"Sometime in May 2020, Bitcoin miners will see their profits suddenly cut in half. Called ""the halving,"" the event is not an accident but a function of the software supporting the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. The halving is meant to maintain the integrity of Bitcoin as it matures and inches toward achieving its ultimate supply limit.

Bitcoin has already seen two halvings, once in 2012, when Bitcoin was still a geek fad, and again in 2016, before the rising interest in cryptocurrencies and digital tokens caused a surge in the price of Bitcoin. This time around, things are much different. Bitcoin is worth around 20 times its value at the previous halving, has a market cap of around $130 billion, and large companies have built profitable businesses around mining the cryptocurrency. The next halving will certainly have huge repercussions in the mining industry and the Bitcoin community.

Here’s what you need to know as the next halving draws close.

Bitcoin future prediction:,"Bitcoin future prediction: 

Honestly, in 2011 it went from pennies to $20, then back down to $4. In 2013 it went from $4 to $200, back down to $60 ish and then up to $1000 and then back down to $300. It fluctuated a few times before 2017 when it went to $20,000 and then back down to $6000… All of those previous swings are larger than the swings we’re seeing now. Now everyone is acting like the sky is falling because it lost half it’s value from peak, even though we’ve seen worse swings than this. Due to past trends, I legitimately think we’ll see it go up to $50,000 or even $100,000 before it tanks back down to $20,000 ish. If that happens, I think we’ll see people say the same thing that they’re saying now; “Bitcoin lost so much value, it’s finished,” just like they’re doing now, and I think they’ll be just as wrong that time too.

Runs.com - Blockchain based eCommerce Platform for Unparalleled Curated Experiences,"*Processing img ixdepwb3tg711...*

Runs.com is the world's first Blockchain-based eCommerce platform for experiences targeting over 2.5 billion people. Runs.com is headquartered in Singapore with offices in New York and Bangalore. We are initially bringing together Coffee, Cinema &amp; Cricket enthusiasts from around the world onto our platform. Our aim is to build a global community of people around their interest areas in 25 countries and 125 cities.

We plan on achieving this by building a decentralized platform where the decision-making power lies with the user rather than the platform.

[Runs.com](http://www.runs.com/) is led by **Giri Devanur** who is an **EY Entrepreneur** of the year award winner in **2017** and an Alumnus of Columbia University. Giri was the **CEO of AMERI100**, a company that made its journey to **NASDAQ** in just four years. Giri Devanur is joined by Dr. Artit Wangperawong who holds a Ph.D. from Stanford University.

Our Token Generation Event (TGE) comprises of **2 phases** \- presale and crowd sale. There will be a total of 75,000,000 tokens available for contributors.

**The presale will come with an attractive 30\% Bonus** **as an early bird offer.** Backers and fans can log onto [www.runs.com](http://www.runs.com/) to be a part of this on a first come first served basis, for a limited time-period. **Runs, recently closed a seed funding of $1M backed by Panamax Capital, Beast Capital and Columbia Angels**.

Runs.com will be disrupting traditional eCommerce platforms which use SKUs as the fundamental way to identify units. Moving away from the conventional SKUs, Runs.com has patented a **new method** of identification and tracking called XKU - 'Experience Keeping Unit'. Runs.com XKUs will cover the 3-S parameters - Story, Source and Sustainability.

**What is an XKU?**

An XKU is a product and service identification code for an item that helps track the item for inventory. It can be assigned to both physical and non-physical products in inventory.

Unlike SKUs whose code usually reveals a product’s details, such as color, size, style, price, manufacturer and brand, an XKU includes the basic elements of SKU and three S-factors- Story, Source, and Sustainability.

Each XKU has a unique experience attached to it and is secured on the Blockchain as a ledger entry.

My 2 Sats...,"While I am a nocoiner, I have grown to appreciate the opportunities that bitcoin gives people. I used to work at Walmart, I was a customer service manager for about 19 months. I oversaw the money center and had to know all the policies and procedures regarding transfers. So many times people would come in and want to send money and would then complain about the fees. 

In the states it was $4 for &lt;$49.99 and $8 for &gt;$50. So many times people would complain that it was over 10%  more in fees for just sending $50. When it came to sending out of the country it was a crapshoot for exchange rates and fees. Also, sometime around February, we became unable to send or receive money from China. I always thought to myself how much easier it would be if people just transferred money using bitcoin.

I’m back with the eighteenth monthly Bitcoin news recap.

Satoshi's Book - confirms private keys to 1m BTC deleted?,"The 'real' Satoshi is now supposedly writing a book and this is an except just released:

[http://nakamotofamilyfoundation.org/duality.pdf](http://nakamotofamilyfoundation.org/duality.pdf)

One sentence on page 14 relating to when Satoshi left the project:

&gt;""*I corresponded for a little bit more, and soon after erased everything that had linked me to Satoshi*.""

Does this imply ***everything*** was deleted, including their private keys ? 

I guess we'll need to wait for the book release. 

This does appear a bit of a con job to me though, especially given the tacky puzzle and all the private details that Satoshi would never release (e.g. he worked in a university lab whilst creating Bitcoin, likely on east coast USA, now mid-40's as he joined cypherpunk movement at 14, his mother was an author, grandmother owned a publishing business, etc). So in my opinion this book is fake unless a signed message or associated bitcoin movement occurs. Don't trust, validate.

But... what if this is proven real? This wouldn't be the first weird shit to happen in crypto. If we can confirm Satoshi 's private keys to an approx 1m Bitcoin are lost that would be a rocket for the price. I also hope a section is devoted to all the Faketoshi and ""Satoshi's Vision"" fork nonsense we've had to endure.

At least bitcoin is never boring. For that, I thank the real real Satoshi!",1530522215,02/07/2018 09:03:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vh7bt/satoshis_book_confirms_private_keys_to_1m_btc/,1
Can we stop with this HODL BS?,"I’m sick and tired of seeing posts by people saying ‘just hodl’. 

Hodling is bad for adoption. 

All this ‘hodl’ bs needs to stop. 

Buying bitcoin and forgetting about it for two years isn’t good for anything other than making/losing money. Which it’s not meant to be about. 

Spend bitcoin so more people use/accept/see it as legitimate. Then the price will increase naturally. 

There’s nothing wrong with hodling, but all of this shit that gets spouted over reddit about how everyone should hodl ain’t right and this is one of the reasons that we are in this bear market. 

Everyone lost sight of the end goal.

The No.1 obstacle to mainstream adoption is...,"Ignorance!

This is a real conversation I had with a friend once:

Me: “Hey, Bob, maybe you should invest in some Bitcoin.”

Bob: “Oh yeah I was thinking about it a while back.”

Me: “That’s a shame, it’s around $3000 now”

Bob: “yeah, it was $1000 back then.”

Me: “so why didn’t you invest in some back then?”

Bob:”it was too expensive”

Me: “what do you mean?”

Bob: “I didn’t have enough to buy a Bitcoin”

This is someone who studied electronics and if you spoke to him you’d think he was above average intelligence. Yet he was completely unaware that you could buy a fraction of a Bitcoin!
I was stunned.
But I think it really goes to show just how early days we are still in. Even though a lot of people have heard of Bitcoin, many of them are still totally clueless about how it works.

"""The Gold Rush is Just Starting"" (c) Brian Kelly, 2015","*""The pioneers of the Bitcoin Big Bang are only the vanguard. There is an entire economic infrastructure to be built. In 1850s California, once the easily accessible gold was collected, the gold rush began to fade. However, its legacy is ever present—California is still known as the Golden State, and San Francisco is a hub of entrepreneurial discovery. Even the road signs for California state routes are in the shape of a miner’s spade. Likewise, the digital gold rush is beginning to influence its environment. San Francisco is a hotbed of Bitcoin start-ups, and both New York and California are vying to be the digital currency capitals. Unlike the short-lived California gold rush, the Bitcoin Big Bang has the potential to be so widespread that this gold rush should last for decades. To be sure, some of the early Bitcoin miners collected the easily accessible “gold,” but there is much more to this technology than just digital gold. Applications are being developed using Bitcoin’s blockchain technology to disrupt the legal professional, financial markets, banking, and even voting. Bitcoin as a currency, or medium of exchange, is just the beginning. It is the vanilla ice cream within the hot fudge sundae. Layered on top of the technology will be applications that enable peer-to-peer lending to boom, legal documents to become digitized smart contracts, and voting to take place from your mobile phone. Like the Internet, the potential uses of Bitcoin are endless, which means this digital gold rush is just getting started. There is still time to become the next Levi Strauss or Wells and Fargo.""*",1530530514,02/07/2018 11:21:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vhuzn/the_gold_rush_is_just_starting_c_brian_kelly_2015/,1

OCC + Aircoins = the Pokemon Go of Crypto,"The Original Crypto Coin team is thrilled to announce our partnership with Aircoins – an augmented reality (AR) game that will let players find and collect cryptocurrency (including OCC!) around their neighborhoods in a virtual treasure hunt. According to the Aircoins website:

App users can login and collect coins in Augmented Reality. Users walk into a shopping center or market and can pull App to see coins available in AR… Just like collecting POKÉMONS in ‘POKÉMON GO’.

Aircoins plans to launch their free Android app in the Google Play store in July, with an iOS version to follow. We’re excited for the opportunity to spread OCC to a wider audience of crypto enthusiasts by having our tokens integrated into the Aircoins AR platform alongside other coins including Electra, Fanfare, and Action. It’s an exciting use case which helps OCC further its aims of spreading crypto to new users.

We’ll keep you posted when Aircoins goes live. In the meantime, head over to the official Aircoins Twitter to learn more about Aircoins and their other partners! While you’re there, you’ll have a chance to win 10,000 AIR. You can also find the latest Aircoins updates on Telegram.

I bought my first bits of Bitcoin yesterday. While I wait for the transaction to clear, takes about a week for me, and Bitcoin increases in value, I’m guessing I will lose some money. Because if I bought say 1/20 of a Bitcoin and it goes up in value, I would then only own like a 1/23 am I right?

"Bitcoin will reach $50,000 by end of year, says founder of bitcoin exchange","Despite the recent bloodbath in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin bull Arthur Hayes said the popular digital coin will reach $50,000 by the end of the year.

Bitcoin's price has been on a wild roller coaster with investors, but ""something that goes up to \[around\] $20,000 in one year can have a correction,"" Hayes, the co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, said on ""Fast Money"" Friday. BitMEX, or Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, is the largest cryptocurrency trading platform by volume.

*""We could definitely find a bottom in the $3,000 to $5,000 range,"" he said. ""But we’re one positive regulatory decision away, many an ETF approved by the SEC, to climbing through $20,000 and even to $50,000 by the end of the year.""*

In May, Hayes told CNBC that bitcoin would reach $50,000 by the end of the year. He remained bullish on his forecast about the coin, despite a deep retrenchment in the digital currency's price.

Last week bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell below the $6,000 mark. The coin was priced around $5,900 Friday 5 p.m. ET, a steep decline from the December 2017 highs of around $19,500. Bitcoin is down 57 percent in 2018.

Meanwhile, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash and ripple are down for the year as well. But Hayes pointed out that bitcoin's volatile nature — and the possibility of large gains —is what makes it so attractive to investors.

*""We’ve done these kind of moves before,""* he said. With more people in the market comes more capital and the potential for faster jumps in price, Hayes added.

*""Now that we have more visibility, more people talking about \[bitcoin\], the time between an aggressive bear market and an aggressive bull market, I think, is going to shorten,""* he said.

F Banks !,"Don't mind me I'm just here to vent and maybe warn a few fellow crypto frens.

This happened to me today. I applied for a loan at my bank and had all the oks so I went in to the branch to sign the final documents.

Gave my id to the lady at the desk. She put some details in (dunno what since I already had contact with the bank and have a bank account there) and at the end when she pressed finish an error came on. I couldn't tell what it said because the monitor was a bit far and at an angle but her facial expression changed and I knew right away what happened.

A few weeks ago I received a phone call from someone at the bank that asked me about a transaction (I had sold my bcashlol a few days before on bitstamp) and I told her I had some crypto and sold. I'm not a trader.

Long story short ... I'm redlined and the bank won't give me a loan or have anything to do with me and if I have another crypto related transaction they'll close my account too.

This comes at a very VERY bad time for me since I'm in the process of building a home for me and my family and the money I wanted to loan was vital to finishing it and now I'm royally screwed because I have no more crypto and the bank won't loan me any money so .... yeah ...

"An Inevitable Outcome of those ""Transaction Equals Mining"" Type of Exchanges","In the past few weeks, some exchanges, especially those new to the market, came up with a ""they think they're the smarites"" kinda idea, where tokens of the exchange per se will be reimbursed to traders. The tokens are regarded as real money, for they're tradable for, say, bitcoin. Some influential exchanges also followed the tactic, adding variables to the game.

It is undeniable that the strategy is indeed fierce. In order to save your penny in the bear, it is natural to go to these exchanges to trade. And there are people with real trading demands who want to save on trading fees, moved from the old-fashion exchange to where reimburse.

Trading mining has indeed brought more depth of deals and rivals, which is also a good thing for real traders.

So what's next? 

To do the math, we must see the essence of this routine. In fact, transaction mining is in principle a user subsidy.

Ways of subsidizing users were vastly seen in the past decade, i.e., the internet age. From free, to pay for use, those old-school internet giants are manipulating the market towards monopoly through cycles of endless subsidaries. After rounds and rounds of fighting, the last surviver rules the market and gets all customers.

Simple as it seems: the ones with the most burnable money last. User subsidy is in essence a capital game.

Fair enough to say, due to the efforts of user education, change of habits, ...etc., there is a ""transition cost"", in the user data, where it shows a certain lap and gap, the retention rate.

When the subsidy stops, how many competitors are there and how many active users are staying, are crucial. 

FCOIN, the first employed the strategy, followed by Okex and Binance and others are playing this game skillfully at the moment, but it has nothing to do with blockchain nor creactivity. Needless to link it to decentralization or whatever higher purpose it claims to serve.

It's just another crappy strategy adopted from the classic internet trying to coat itself with blockchain. 

Therefore, you can learn from the history how this will end, Ubers or Groupons alike, there's nothing new. 

The competitors are eventually fallen, acquired or merged. 

Sounds like a happy ending, however transient. The market will not stop there. All brunch of players will re-surface after a brief silence.

The moats created by capital subsidies are just like building fortifications directly on the battlefield with banknotes. It is almost like no moat at all...

Although for most people, money is scarce. But in many cases, it is just too abundant. 

Under what circumstances may a subsidy game incarnate its value?

The subsidy wars between Alipay and WeChat reveals a good example, where neither can takeover  their counterpart and finally comes to a balance.

The most critical factor is that the cost of user migration is insurmountably high. Both parties found users are no longer attracted to or taken away by subsidies. Then they start to focus on improving other aspects.

Can the exchange subsidy battle reach this step? Are barriers to user migration sufficiently high to withstand the temptation of interest?

I am afraid, never.",1530546872,02/07/2018 15:54:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vjpc2/an_inevitable_outcome_of_those_transaction_equals/,1

Please dont listen to all the FUD being said about the lightning network lets not forget its still in what its ALPHA stage?,"Dont let others take you away from reality, the process has been consistent &amp; we can see the live improvements. 

I see all this FUD about how the Lighting network fails 99&amp;#37; of the time with Big transactions, Why is this even being entertained? - The fact we are still in the Alpha stage i wont even say Beta &amp; the fact almost all tests and improvements have been done with micro-transactions up to 25$, shows how most people just jump on the bandwagon.

\+ Bitcoin is completely capable of handling big transactions why even use Lighting Network for that? The aim of LN is to scale Bitcoin yes but at the Micro-transaction level, At the retail level that is what we need. If there is a layer on Bitcoin that handles all the Micro-transactions, using Bitcoin with-out LN for big transactions should be no issue.

I'm trying to estimate the amount of electricity used by Bitcoin miners. Is my approach accurate?,"According to https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty the total hashrate of the network is 37,498,417,926 GH/s which is 37,498,417.926 TH/s. 

To get an estimate of the amount of miners on the network, I am using the Antminer S9 as the baseline. So with 13.5 TH/s for each Antminer S9, we can guess the amount of Antminer S9s on the network to be 

37,498,417.926 / 13.5 = 2,777,660 Antminers on the network

Each Antminer has power consumption of 1310W. 

When I put that into https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/energy-consumption-calculator.html I get 

8.73296e+7 KWh/day 

Does this seem right? I also need to consider adding the energy spent on cooling, but I'm trying to get the base down first.",1530563843,02/07/2018 20:37:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vm1id/im_trying_to_estimate_the_amount_of_electricity/,1

A fun way to spread the word about BTC,"So I’ve gotten in the habit of saying “so when are you guys going to accept Bitcoin?” Whenever and where ever I pay with Fiat. 

It’s more for my own entertainment, but you would be Surprised at the responses you get and the conversations it starts. 

I know on the surface this seems like a shit post, maybe it is, but I think we are all far too comfortable shilling to each other and ranting on about crypto currencies with other crypto heads. But when it comes to bringing it up to the “common folk” and truly evangelizing for its adoption, I think people are generally gun-shy.

So... for those who fall into the “gun-shy” category.. give it a try! If more people asked and expressed a demand, then perhaps that demand might get met...hmmmm.

If anything, you’ll get some entertainment at the cashier 😁

Automatic Bitcoin price channel prediction. Support and resistance levels. Updated hourly.,"Hi all!

We launched experimental tool which makes technical analysis easier. We are trying to predict support and resistance levels for different timeframes.

Medium article with better formatting: https://medium.com/bitgur/automatic-price-channel-prediction-fe05dd544086

Bitcoin (BTC) report: https://bitgur.com/coin/BTC/prediction

#Description
This tool consists of three charts which help with technical analysis for the next 24 hours, 7 and 30 days. Each chart is based on data from three previous periods. A channel prediction for 24 hours is based on data from the last 72 hours. A channel prediction for 7 days is based on data from the last 21 days and a prediction for 30 days is also constructed. The weight of data decreases with time. Reports are updated hourly.


#Each chart has the following elements:

**1. Volume profile histogram in the left part of the chart.**

Volume profile histogram is based on the data from the previous three periods and is designed to determinate price channel.
You may read more on how to use this type of chart in technical analysis in this article on one of the popular trading sites:
https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Volume_Profile

**2. Red lines**

They are edges of a current price channel based on volume profile analysis.

**3. Orange lines**

They are main resistance and support levels for the chart, which were achieved in the course of past trades. They do not depend on the selected period.

 If more than 10 levels are found for the current price range, then 10 most significant are selected and shown on the chart. The weight of the level is based on a scale from 0 to 100. Where 100 is the weight of the global minimum or maximum (depending on which trend was stronger). The weight of the remaining levels is always less than 100 and shows how significant the minimum or maximum was.

**4. Cryptocurrency price chart**

It’s weighted price from dozens of main exchanges.



#Probable Use Cases

**1.** If you do not have a short-term trading strategy and want to open or close a position in the near future, the table of current levels can help you choose the best price.

**2.** You have a short-term trading strategy, but it does not take into consideration all historical minimums and maximums. In this case, it will be useful for you to see levels that can significantly influence the behaviour of the market.


The choice of a timeframe (24 hours, 7 or 30 days) for analysis depends on your trading strategy.

#Links

Despite the fact that we create prediction page for several hundreds of coins you must remember that this tool can be useful mostly for coins with large trade volume.

Bitcoin gambling stuff/lottery,"I'm thinking of making a site for Bitcoin gambling. More like Bitcoin lottery system. Getting a fixed amount from some specified number of players and rolling when the table is full. Who wins and how much and more importantly who loses and how much is to be decided such that the player can play the next game too.
The problem of trust. How do I make you give me your coin? I want you to keep on coming and playing. So the question of me running away taking your coins is something which shouldn't be bothering any of you. 
The winners will be completely random. 
Plus thinking of considering deepweb.

Usually it takes 20-40 minutes to received my money whenever I'm using legacy address, but after I try the CashAddr, I received the money in seconds! Is CashAddr faster than legacy address or maybe I'm just lucky? I'm sorry if it sounds like a dumb question, i'm not tech savvy at all. I try to google the answers but cannot find any answers.

Does the lightning-network have a chicken-and-egg problem when it comes to receiving payments?,"I recently played a game of roulette on http://lightningspin.com/. Sending the satoshi's went great, but when i wanted to receive my earnings i found out that i first had to empty my channel before i could receive new payments. So i first have to spend my satoshis before i can receive new ones. 

An option would be for the lightningspin guy to open a channel with me and pay me directly but wasn't LN supposed to be all about routing payment and not having to make individual channels? 

I myself solved this situation by converting my satoshis to bitcoin via https://lightningconductor.net/ so that i had an empty channel in which to receive my earnings. But this is quite cumbersome for the average user.

If i would have been a charity on the internet who wanted to just receive lightning payments this would be very inconvenient. The charity would first have to create (one or more) channels, empty them and then be able to receive payments. So that seems like sort of an chicken and egg problem. I guess you can't expect new LN users to first have to spend before they can receive can you ?

- Am i right in seeing this as an issue ? / am i missing something ?
- I guess opening direct channels would be the solution but isn't this a little too complicated/costly for new users ?

So, what exactly is Blockchain? The term Blockchain refers to a list of records that constantly grow when more information is added to it. These blocks (chains of information) are linked and secured using cryptography. 

 So, if you like to stay ahead of the technology boom and get your hands on the next best thing, this course is made just for you! The course has been designed from the ground up to give you simple and easy to understand course on Blockchain. Using a jargon free approach, you will learn what exactly Blockchain is, what are it’s different implementations, how to get started with building your own blockchain application from scratch, and so much more! 

 The focus of this effective guide will be to help you get a more hands-on approach that includes the supportive theory as well. However, we will not bore you with just theory that doesn’t help you understand the implementations or even how to work with the technology once you finish this course. 

The course focuses on helping you learn the core concepts of Blockchains, including how the Blockchain is changing the way people trade, important cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, how a distributed ledger works and why big banks and software companies are excited about this technology.

That’s not all, you’ll also get to learn practical applications of Blockchain by building a functional widget application from scratch. At the end of this course, you’ll not only have a fantastic understanding of [Blockchain technology](https://www.udemy.com/developers-guide-to-blockchain-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies/?couponCode=UJBITCOIN18), but you’ll also know how to exactly utilize blockchain and build applications with it. That’s not all. You’ll also have access to resource files and you can even add the app we build in this course to your resume, which means you’ll already start off with an app!",1530601770,03/07/2018 07:09:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vq6xm/guide_to_blockchain_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrencies/,1

OKEx Launched The Digital Asset Exchange Open Partnership Program,"Dear  Valued Customers,

After 6 months of closed development, OKEx's next-generation exchange system has been brought to testing. On 20 Jun, 2018 (Hong Kong time), OKEx officially launches the Digital Asset Exchange Open Partnership Program and begins the recruitment of “OK Partners”. By sharing the fruits of OKEx's matching system, counter system, cold wallet, hot wallet, clearing system, multilingual customer support, as well as global know-your-customer and anti-laundering system cultivated for years with our OK Partners, the program is set to nurture a new generation of digital asset exchanges characterized by high autonomy, efficiency and transparency. Aspiring teams who aim to establish their own digital asset exchanges, only need to provide their domain names, logos, operation force, and to focus on the management and operations of the exchange. OKEx's global technical team, on the other hand, will provide R&amp;D and system maintenance supports to the teams, who will share the high liquidity and advanced trading experience offered by the world-leading digital asset exchange.

The 1st phase of the program offers 100 places for participating teams. Applicants are required to deposit 500,000 OKB in their accounts, excluding the amount locked for Designated Merchant, New Listing Vote, and Prime Investors. The ideal candidates for OK Partners should possess solid industry experience, quest for service excellence, and strong industry influence. The 1st phase is expected to go online in late July. Interested parties should submit their contact person's name and phone number as well as team description to

How do we comply with FinCEN and Title 31 laws/ regulations?,"I would like to begin trading on LocalBitcoins and similar fiat-to-crypto peer-to-peer exchanges. I am trying to find all the rules I have to follow to do this legally but from the articles I've read about people being arrested for trading on LBC, it doesn't appear to be black and white. While some of these guys were clearly breaking the law, there are some instances where a trader is arrested for ""running an unlicensed money transmission business"" with not much detail on exactly why or what specifically what rules were broken.

Here are just a few:

- [Man and father trading on LocalBitcoins sentenced to 9 and 4 years in prison respectively for running an unlicensed money transmission business](https://www.coindesk.com/9-years-localbitcoins-trader-sentenced-latest-money-transmission-case)

- [Michigan LocalBitcoins trader pleads guilty to running an unlicensed money servies business (sold $1900 worth of BTC to undercover agents)](https://www.coindesk.com/localbitcoins-trader-pleads-guilty-money-transmitter-charge/)

- [Missouri LocalBitcoins trader pleads guilty to running an unlicensed money transmission business (sold $30,000 worth of BTC to undercover agents)](https://www.coindesk.com/localbitcoins-user-pleads-guilty-undercover-sting/)

- [New York man pleads guilty to unlawful money transmission (sold $13,000 worth of BTC to undercovers then lied to the feds about it)](https://www.coindesk.com/new-york-bitcoin-trader-guilty/)

- [Two LocalBitcoins traders from Florida charged with money laundering and running an unlicensed money transmission business (tried to sell $30,000 in BTC to undercovers. This one says they're being charged with state-level crimes, not federal)](https://www.coindesk.com/localbitcoins-users-criminal-charges-florida/)

- [Las Vegas LocalBitcoins trader arrested for money laundering and running an unlicensed money transmitting business (sold $9000 worth of BTC for $14500 to undercovers that told him they cash came from selling hash oil)](https://www.ccn.com/las-vegas-localbitcoins-trader-accused-money-laundering/)

I'm sure there are plenty more.

So far, I've summed up to morals of these stories up to the following:

- Don't trade more than $10,000 at a time, though it is probably wise to stay much lower than that.
- Don't trade with anyone suspected of engaging in illegal activity using the BTC/ whatever that you're trading to them.
- Consider registering as an MSB with FinCEN (not sure what other hoops there will be to jump through with this).
- Don't violate state laws.

Currently I'm attempting to read through the FinCEN website and Title 31 itself but they're not exactly written for laymen. Does anyone have any insight there can share on this topic? Any help or guidance at all is appreciated.",1530607295,03/07/2018 08:41:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vqmew/how_do_we_comply_with_fincen_and_title_31_laws/,1

I guess I could just use another wallet to convert to another bank account in another country, but I rather just cash it out to my bank account here. The other option is to just go to a currency exchange and encash it out but I want to see if I have options here.

Help me! New to bitcoin.,"Okay, So I'm really new to this bitcoin thingie and was thinking about implementing it into my buisness. I tried to send some bitcoin to my wallet (I use Ellectrum since I heard it was a decent once) but I am not sure I did it correctly, since I've been waiting hours now and nothing has showed up anywhere... I was wondering if anyone could help me out, and maybe send something like 0.1 or 0.01 mBTC to my account just so I know I did it right. Here is the BTC account ""1D6CfBqWY2VNze4mfUGCvFYBbXarsPEfDj"". Please, it would be very much appreciated!!

Also, I wonder what the purpose is of the list of all the addresses when i press ""Recieve"" in the app. Are all those addresses linked to my account? Why are there so many of them, and how do I know which one to choose? Also, when Requesting a payment, do I have to fill out an amount and what purpose those that fill? 

Please, would be greatly appreciated if you could clear some of these things up with me. And also make a small ""donation"" of a few cents just to show that my wallet is working, haha.

Have a great day guys, and thank you all so much! 

God Bless.",1530636884,03/07/2018 16:54:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vtsty/help_me_new_to_bitcoin/,1

So, I'm accepting I lost everything on the ledger. Around 1.500€ at these prices...

My only hope is that having 23 of 24 words proves to be a solution. I have contacted Ledger support and await an answer.

Maybe a software that can give me words to try? The thing is that I don't know WHERE is that word missing...

Satoshi Nakamoto is writing a book?,"We still keep you updated with crypto-news. Today we could not miss the message that “broke” the Internet.



There is some information, that there might be a book revealing the mystery of the legendary incognito – Satoshi Nakamoto and those who are behind the creation of bitcoin.



According to the report, Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the text himself. The author stated that book will be released in two parts, giving answers to the most brought up crypto community’s questions.



The first chapter of the autobiography has already appeared in the net. It tells that Satoshi first began to publish reports about Bitcoin when he (or she) was 20 years old. It is also noted that from the age of 14 Satoshi was fascinated by the cypherpunk, which is actually bitcoin is based on.



The author writes that the world-changing project appeared after a series of unsuccessful attempts made by other people. Satoshi succeeded in business only because of being at the right time in the right place.



The crypto community responded ambiguously: some does not believe that this is a real Satoshi, and not just another talk. Some believes this to be another bitcoin promotion. But one thing is for sure: the book is waited by everybody and this is one of the hottest topics in the net!",1530650609,03/07/2018 20:43:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vvnnl/satoshi_nakamoto_is_writing_a_book/,1

"BTC is in the hands of few ppl, how to distribute?","Serious question from a bystander since summer 2013.

This, what always kept me from investing: If I look at crypto, I see a huge share coins in the hands of very few people. And I'm not talking about whales here but about the next door hodler, who has one, two or even three figure amounts of BTC. 

I we scale this up to 7+ billion people. That's a huge amount of all the BTC-wealth in the hands of not 1% or 0.1% but ... well, almost noone. My guess is, that this distribution of crypto is by magnitudes worse than the distribution of current wealth. And that can't be a good thing, right? Are there reliable numbers on this issue?

Thanks for clicking! I need your help, I and a few other are building an app that lists out every location that accepts bitcoin!   


But either there is no backend that does that, or there is no data source that shows that! How about we fix that, what you will have to do is point us to a data source and API or so! Or find an open maps application or google maps and list out every single location that you know accepts bitcoin!

"PSA: You can use your own full node with your hardware wallet, using Electrum Personal Server","We want people to run full nodes, but the same time we encourage the use of hardware wallets. Using your hardware wallet with your personal full node is not possible, unless you run Electrum Personal Server. It allows you to connect your hardware wallet to your own full node through Electrum, meaning you can have offline private keys while having your own node verify your transactions. 

If you have any technical resources and capabilities, I encourage you to look into setting up a full node and use it as your personal gateway to the blockchain with EPS. I managed to do it on a Raspberry Pi, and I'm by no means a technical person. All it takes is patience, persistence and the willingness to learn.

Break even price for miners,"I know that one of the genius aspects of Bitcoin is that the hashrate can adjust to to various prices by simply scaling back but I think I,be seen in several places that there are estimates that most current miners need a price of something over $5,000 right now to remain viable.  Does anyone know if there is a site that tracked these breakevens for various alt-coins?  

I understand that this may be deemed off-topic but I,m really curious. About how joined at the hip most prices are.  Everything moves with Bitcoin.  As the price has dipped in the last couple of months I’ve taken some solace in the fact that BTC is regaining its size advantage.  Personally, I think it is good for Bitcoin overall if some of the crap alts just slip away and die.  There are maybe a half dozen that may offer some slight advantage in a few particular use cases but most of them just soiled the reputation of Bitcoin by littering the space with garbage.

Now, if the BTC price does start to move up, I worry that this coat-tail effect will bring some of those crap coins back from the dead.

Confused about blockchain.info information,"Hi

So I was just casually going trough the blockchain explorer (I know,.. its bad)

I came across this adres: [https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/address/1DcD4MpCe7zg9kErGULhtxo2QH6vXHHsnW](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/address/1DcD4MpCe7zg9kErGULhtxo2QH6vXHHsnW)

now, I have a question and I hope someone can answer it for me.

on page one, on date/time **2015-09-01 16:24:52** there was an output transaction for , so it says,-23 btc; however looking at the individual outputs it adds up to way more (around \~300 btc). I don't think its a matter of return addresses, but im unsure what  it is. Also I counted the total account balance, and its adds up when I count -23 bitcoins, but not \~300btc.

Idea: Non-profit Bitcoin Marketing Foundation,"I was chatting with btc developer friend and we got onto the topic of how the 'black market' is the world's second biggest economy. Black market meaning all unreported transactions, often in places like Africa and India. Half the world's population has such exchanges.

I know the bitcoin foundation with Roger Ver was quite scammy. What if we could do it better? Is anyone trying this? We need to bring bitcoin to the unrepresented peoples around the world and we need the marketing and UX to make it possible. 

I'm talking a fully transparent foundation with clear governance, spending goals and an independent third party escrow with the main goal to raise funds from bitcoin holders and use them to hire world-class global marketing agencies to spread the word of bitcoin and the ways that it can improve finance in developing nations. 

There needs to be better awareness and education behind the uses of bitcoin, and they need to be translated into many languages. Despite how well known Bitcoin is known in the developing world, the people who could benefit most from it at this point is the unbanked.  I would also like to move away from all the marketing being for scam ICOs which are not doing any favors for the reputation of bitcoin.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Are there any projects hoping to accomplish the same thing? ",1530717519,04/07/2018 15:18:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8w2ec3/idea_nonprofit_bitcoin_marketing_foundation/,1

When economic students of the future study monetary history..,"They will see reddit post after reddit post talking about how much a single bitcoin will be worth in dollars. 

To them this will seem as mind boggling as us travelling back to a time before gold was money and cowry shells were used in trade, and seeing people say ""the price of one small gold piece is one day going to be worth 5,000 cowry shells"".

We know today that cowry shells are worthless and trying to guess the price of gold in a number of cowry shells is beyond pointless. The pieces of paper we call money today are going to be viewed of as even more worthless than cowry shells.

1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin. It doesnt matter how many pieces of paper 1 bitcoin will be worth, what matters is how much bitcoin you have compared to the total supply at the end of the day. The price of bitcoin in dollars going up increases your wealth in fiat not in bitcoin.

It would be as insane as seeing people 5000 years ago watching the price of gold measured in cowry shells increasing because gold was taking over as the new form of money, and then selling the gold to get more cowry shells.

The goal should not be how much each bitcoin will be worth in fiat. The goal of everyone should be to obtain as much bitcoin as humanly possible before it is widely used as money around the world.",1530720986,04/07/2018 16:16:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8w2u3l/when_economic_students_of_the_future_study/,1

Why do companies experience a surge in stock price as soon as they announce anything crypto/blockchain related?,"I understand that blockchain is a revolutionary technology and is going to basically improve the world in its own way (if it's not already doing so). 

It just confuses me why companies can have a surge in stock price (7-10&amp;#37;) when they simply announce anything to do with crypto/blockchain (ie: Kodak, even though the price is going back down).",1530726499,04/07/2018 17:48:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8w3jzj/why_do_companies_experience_a_surge_in_stock/,1

Hypocrisy vs hype,"One of the most popular memes I see get reposted here every few weeks is the one saying you wont have to worry about trading back your bitcoin to dollars when it's worth millions because by then it will be widely used and people will accept it as a form of exchange. I dont understand how this can be considered  consistent. Bitcoin is made to be used. No one speculates on utilities or currency (excep some of those rip off companies that recruit people to use their app to trade currency's- please dont fall for this). If bitcoin is meant to be used, it has to be stable. True supporters of bitcoin dont want to make money on it, they want to use it. And to be used it cant fluctuate hundreds of dollars before and after you buy your cup of coffee. To want to get rich off of bitcoin is counter productive to wanting to use bitcoin, as they are mutually exclusive. Wild price fluctuations are good for speculating, but terrible to have businesses use it. Theres no free lunch here.

Problem Statement Of Buddy," Organizations battle with implementing development automation, despite its revolutionary potential. This is because

1. Appllication Automation (DevOps) is a huge boon to organizations but is challenging to adopt. 

2.  The huge amount of various tech, stacks and workflows means it is too difficult for a single party to provide the seamless automation to cover all the popular programming languages, frameworks and services - including Blockchain tech. 

3.  Large teams using DevOps as a key differentiator and value driver, struggle to scale their operational infrastructure ",1530734556,04/07/2018 20:02:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8w4jo8/problem_statement_of_buddy/,1

MATRIX: Start To Evolution (To Huobi.Pro),"As you follow from our telegram and twitter channels, we have pressed the button to get list Matrix at Huobi Pro. There are certain conditions of participation for entry into this crypto stock market, where the world’s most reliable projects are involved, and we believe that Matrix Ai will meet these requirements with our valued followers and communities. Taking into consideration the facts we will specify in this article for this transition, we are in the side of the Matrix and there is no doubt that we will succeed this process successfully.

They have some rules to complete this process :

* **HADAX processing time**  
 The trading duration listed on HADAX will not be less than 20 trading days which we already met.
* **Trading Volume-Number of Traders**  
 As you know, the Matrix has finally made a good entrance into the HADAX exchange market and has maintained its healthy volume now. With our communities and devoted employees, Matrix wishes to be confident in its strategy and targets by expanding the volume in this market by proving its credibility and authenticity by being listened in Huobi Pro. Growth of the volume is an important rule in the Huobi exchange.
* **-The number of traders and the trading volume are equal to or higher than the top 50\% Coin of the Huobi Pro (in order to be TOP 2)** In the Matrix, we are aiming at every cut that we can reach; We share our social media and our active meetings in various countries in a clear and understandable way. Even now, it won t be too difficult for the Matrix to solve these two issues quickly with our team and our communities.
* **Projects should meet the standards of SMART-Chain Evaluation Model of Huobi Pro** One of the important rules for passing the Matrix to Huobi.Pro is that it scores well on the Smart Chain rating model. Smart Chain is a structure designed to distinguish reliable and unreliable projects.Reliable and feasible projects such as the Matrix from this structure and supervision are on the list at Huobi.Pro. We will show once more here that we are a project that has the power to be able to pass through this model as a Matrix. In order to meet these requirements, the date range from 1st of June to 31th of July will be valid!

**HADAX 200,000 MAN Award Competition!**  
 Our expectation from our community is to keep the trading volume healthy and to explain this reliable project to as many investors as possible and to add it to our community. To demonstrate why MATRIX is in this sector, sharing, liking and retweeting are essential.  
 We are pleased to announce that you have a MAN award competition. The rules are clear and simple — to buy and sell MAN tokens at Hadax.  
 The Matrix will share the 200,000 MAN award for those who buy or sell min. 100 MAN from the first 10,000 people in HADAX! Competition is starting today 04.07.2018 to till 11.07.2018

Bitcoin ETF? Let's see...,"I can give my fiat money to a hedge fund guy, who takes a cut and then hopefully gives the rest of my money to a Bitcoin exchange, such as Coinbase, who then take their cut and buy actual Bitcoin on my behalf, then give a cut to their partner so the partner can pay fines to the government (SEC?)... Then I can hope and pray that the hedge fund guy isn't another Bernie Madoff, and I can hope and pray that the exchange does not get hacked, nor robbed from the inside while I hope and pray that the government doesn't confiscate my Bitcoins nor force the exchange to hand some of it over for ""taxes"" or whatnot...

**OR**

I can just buy BTC and stick it into my own wallet where I control the keys, knowing that nobody can unilaterally confiscate it or hack it.  And no middlemen to take their cuts, and no middlemen nor central authorities to be trusted.

Question about hardware wallet with electrum wallet safety.,"I am not sure how it works in the background so I wonder if hardware wallet (like ledger or trezor) created with electrum is generally as safe as a native hardware wallet.

I don't quite like the interface of the hardware wallet and am more familiar with electrum, hence the question.",1530753752,05/07/2018 01:22:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8w6mfw/question_about_hardware_wallet_with_electrum/,1

When reporting crypto tax do you need to list every single purchase or only purchases that you use as cost basis?,"Since the market is down and I have lost more than my initial cost basis I decided to go buy some alts.

When reporting this to the IRS, do I have to list ALL of my BTC purchases or just the corresponding BTC that I later sold to buy an altcoin with? I think I have to list every single purchase because it works by FIFO/LIFO?

For example say in January I bought 5BTC but didn't touch it. Then in March I bought 7BTC and on the same day I traded it for X coin. When reporting the trade of X coin do I only need to report Tue purchase of the 7BTC in March or do I also need to report the purchase of 5BTC in January as well?

Can miners artificially jack up fees injecting in transactions from and to themselves?,"When transactions are close to completely filling a block on busy periods, what prevents miners from injecting into their mined block transactions to themselves, their BTC address to their other BTC address, with high fees to artificially bump other transactions to the next block which then makes all other users want to raise their fees for their transactions so they don't have to wait longer.  The miners don't have to actually broadcast the transaction and risk losing the fee to another miner, correct?  They can just straight up 'mine it in' so if they don't win this block, they just try again next block with no risk of the artificial fee going to a different miner.  Since they will be bumping off the transactions that are paying the absolute least, they don't lose much overall either.  Causing all transactions to artificially increase would cover the loss of the few lowest of the low fees they don't get this block.  If enough miners do this, or say China gets &gt;51% of the hash rate, why would they not simply jack up fees higher then natural market demand?  Or is this not possible to do? (And explain why it isn't.)",1530772555,05/07/2018 06:35:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8w8bi7/can_miners_artificially_jack_up_fees_injecting_in/,1

what do you dislike about current hardware wallets,"**please fill out the survey if you have a minute!**   [**https://surveyhero.com/c/eb6a5de0**](https://surveyhero.com/c/eb6a5de0)

&gt;!I will randomly pick 10 participants to send out BITCOINS!!!! leave address in the end of survey!&lt;

Trezor and Ledger are the current best hardware wallets for what I can tell.

But we still find it too complicated to use especially for ledger nano S.

We are on the early phase of developing a more secured and user-friendly product which will support bluetooth and fingerprint feature!!! This survey will help us a lot!!!

We have at last a DEFINITIVE proof that Craig Wright is not Satoshi if this message is from Satoshi,"For those unaware of this message, if you read page five, Satoshi Nakamoto explains he was in his twenties. This makes it incompatible with the age of Craig Wright.

Quote :

""\[...\] Trying as a twenty something to appear older than what you are in a community that counts age as experience in order to throw people off and get them to accept your work, while trying to push something you so strongly believe in \[...\] ""

Fastest way to take out my money from HitBTC?,"Hi!

I have some coins on HitBTC which I would really like to use, but I can’t. I can’t move them from the main account to the trading account (Error: “Currency operation unavailable”), and can’t withdraw neither (“Wallet unavailable”). I already contacted them through the support, they told me to change my password and activate 2FA (which was activated already, but why not), and then they will solve the “Currency operation” error. I did it and told them, but I didn’t get answer since then. As I see, other people have trouble with HitBTC too, so I think the only solution is to contact them through a formal way (official email, mail).

My question is, how can I get them to solve my problem manually, as fast as possible?

Fortunately, I’m from the EU (just like HitBTC), so I can do it in legal way, if it is needed.

So, do you guys have any suggestions?",1530787929,05/07/2018 10:52:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8w9ikc/fastest_way_to_take_out_my_money_from_hitbtc/,1

Simple question,"We all know that the number of bitcoin is limited to 21 Millions and we also know that part of them has been and will be lost, my point is: 

How can bitcoin become a ""global currency"" if in the long run its value will increase?

Why I should spend my coin today if tomorrow they are going to value more? 

I always considered the fact that bitcoin is limited like a pros, (more it value, more ""money"" I have) but now i'm changing opinion. 
Back to these considerations there are some basics economical theories (that i'm not going to explain in this post), but an example can be (y=c+s) if the main component is s there is no consumption and the economy and the value of its money will, in the long run crash. 

I will really appreciate if someone might explain me or better provides some articles that talk about this ""problem"", i'm really interested in understand how the future can be, and if bitcoin will be there.

How Hodling helps Bitcoin,"Let's stop saying hodling hurts bitcoin. There is sometimes a general sentiment that hodlers are ""what's wrong"" with Bitcoin. ""They're not in it for the tech,"" we hear. The reasoning being that Bitcoin will not grow if it is not spent and exchanged. While I believe ""spend and replace"" is a superior strategy, let's be real, at present there is not a whole bunch to spend on without going well out of your way.

Moreover, many bitcoin holders (you'll excuse me if I switch to the non-standard spelling) really believe in the tech but do not have the skill set to contribute. As a mechanical engineer I fall into this category. I am fascinated by the tech and believe in it, but have little ability to contribute.

How holding helps:

1. There are many people that DO have the skillset to contribute to the Bitcoin protocol, development of apps, and mining of bitcoin. Holders help to incentivize these activities simply by stabilizing the price of bitcoin. Many developers in the crypto space are partially compensated in crypto and the prices being stable helps them just as much as anyone else. It's harder to retain talented people if compensation is uncertain.
2. While currencies need to be spent to be useful they also need to have value to be useful. Holders ""hoarding"" bitcoin adds legitimacy to this value. It shows that there are people out there that believe in the value of Bitcoin. And ultimately that's what gives any currency value; the belief that it has value.
3. If you believe in Bitcoin and want to see it succeed there needs to be fewer stories of people getting rekt. In the long term and on average hodlers have not gotten rekt. This recent crash is discouraging because your Grandma and Uncle's first experience with bitcoin was buying at 18K and selling at 6K. Reputation hits like that are hard to fix. I think long-term hodling is the cure.

I know this post subconsciously degraded into holding vs. trading, but I think the points stand well on their own. There is real use in buying a little bit whenever you can and Holding. There may be better ways to help Bitcoin, but holding isn't a bad start.",1530802350,05/07/2018 14:52:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wb1q9/how_hodling_helps_bitcoin/,1

Биткойн может вырасти до 50 000$ к концу года,"В пятницу ночью, оттолкнувшись от отметки в 5800$, биткойн неожиданно снова ушел в восходящий тренд, хотя еще за день до этого многие прогнозировали дальнейшее падение. Например, трейдер Ран Нойнер на телеканале СNBC прогнозировал снижение до 5350$ в ближайшие недели.
Не смотря на подобные пессимистические прогнозы, глава биржи BitMEX, Артур Хейс подтвердил свой прежний прогноз о том, что стоимость 1 биткойна составит 50 000$ к концу текущего года. Хейс отметил, что несмотря на затяжное снижение цены, биткойн способен более чем в два раза превысить прошлогодние декабрьские рекорды:  «Я полагаю, что актив, который может вырасти на 20 000 $ за год, вполне может и скорректироваться до 6000$».

"BTC ""ATMs"" are harmful to BTCs growth!"," ""ATM's"" in public spaces ...

Am I the only one who sees these as MASSIVE deterrents to the growth of crypto adoption?

Bob/Alice (lets assume in this scenario they are a middle aged, middle class person...) Hears from Pete/Sudan at work, or their grandkids, about this ""Bitcoin money"". 

So they go to their local novelty BTC ATM... Purchase some. Then they proceed to learn a bit about Bitcoin etc... 

Now Bob/Alice realises how MASSIVELY ripped off they got. 😓 10%, 15% fee! 

Now assume this also coincides with a bear market and boom! They're left feeling MASSIVELY cheated and thinking 'Why would I EVER be involved with this in the future?'

Esp(!!!!) when they can just use 'safe' currrent financial instruments. 

...

My point here is every time someone posts a ""Hey look a BTC ATM!!!"" post... Doesn't anyone else cringe?

Yes, short term it provides exposure. Long term tho IMO the fees are ripping ppl off. And for anyone about to respond with 'buyer beware', remember, our community's goal is ADOPTION. This will ONLY come with trust. While Blkchain IS a mathematical financial instrument that guarantees a high level of trust... The wild west ecosphere is going to excluse A HUGE majority of the general pop.

Any insight into this?

Will more ATMs breed competition ie: lower fees?

Have I missed something?

For millenials this 'Bitcoin' money isn't as an arduous concept to trust/believe...

But damn... For the Boomer generation and Gen Xers to an extent, it's already a hard enough sell w/o ATM rip off fees.",1530810232,05/07/2018 17:03:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wc4g1/btc_atms_are_harmful_to_btcs_growth/,1
Why does the halving only take place once every 4 years...,"A supply shock that dramatic once every 4 years has to contribute to volatility.

Why not reduce the supply by a smaller percentage more often so that the 21 million cap in the year 2140 is still achieved, but without the dramatic supply decrease.

If there was a tiny 1% supply reduction once per month instead of a massive 50% supply reduction once every 4 years wouldnt this help reduce volatility and leave us with a bitcoin price that never sees extreme bubbles after halvings but instead just slowly climbs month by month.",1530810391,05/07/2018 17:06:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wc59s/why_does_the_halving_only_take_place_once_every_4/,1

I am looking for developers in Prague for a blockchain-based logistics solution,"I have a pretty modern vertical farm in Southern California.

I am based in California but I spend a lot of time in Prague and I feel that the talent pool here is a good fit for this.

I cannot guarantee that it will be a full-time/long-term “job” but I would like to design a solution that would work for all farmers. And I would actually like to form a company that could make this logistics solution available to other farmers.

I have recently gone through the blockchain-based Food Supply Chain solution from IBM. For those of you who have seen the IBM solution (and met with their group) you will know what I am talking about when I say, “Those guys just don't get it.”

How to handle taxation of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin while being a citizen in Canada?,"Hello,

I'm starting a job soon which pays me in a cryptocurrency, and I was wondering if anyone else has experience with how to handle tax it.

From what [i've read](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/taxes/some-basic-answers-to-the-tax-implications-of-cryptocurrencies/article37749902/), it is treated as property, and an exchanges requires me to file capital gains/losses on it. However, it also suggests that if i'm paid in a cryptocurrency, it is magically treated as money, which is taxed again.

Does anyone have experience with this in Canada? It's been difficult to comprehend what exactly i'm supposed to do.",1530819330,05/07/2018 19:35:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wddkd/how_to_handle_taxation_of_cryptocurrencies_like/,1

NEW! CoinEx Exchange | Trade driven mining,"Hello Redditor!

I wanted to share something really interesting with you. ViaBTC released a new Exchange called ""CoinEx"".

In my opinion it is an amazing Exchange.

If you want to support me a bit, please use my referal, because this would be really awesome! :

[https://www.coinex.com/account/signup?refer\_code=2t4nc](https://www.coinex.com/account/signup?refer_code=2t4nc)

So now let's take a look:

The Chinese-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinEx was established sometime in 2017. The exchange has a wide range of cryptocurrency assets users can trade on the platform. Cryptos are being traded against the BCH, BTC, ETH, and USDT cryptocurrencies.

The exchange has also launched its native cryptocurrency which can be traded against the majors on the platform. Though the exchange is just starting off, plans are underway to building a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange which will be fueled by the CoinEx Token (CET).

The platform is built with the user in mind – one of the most simple-to-use – even a novice can make his way around the platform without needing any help. Also, it is loaded with ground-breaking features which have swept many users off their feet.

CoinEx has a wide array of cryptocurrencies (coins and tokens) to trade from. As earlier mentioned, these cryptos are traded against the majors on the platform; the Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) cryptocurrencies.

CoinEx charges just the market takers a 0.10&amp;#37;, but market makers (a dealer who undertakes to buy or sell at specified prices at all times) are not charged for transactions on the exchange.

CoinEx implements a “Full Dimension Protection” security system. The platform uses various protocols in securing different aspect of the platform. You can be assured that all transactions relating to payments, exchange, and transfers made on the platform are very secured.

The exchange announced its “Trade-driven Mining” concept which helps in releasing the CET tokens which will be re-allocated to users on the CoinEx trading platform.

All transaction fees on the platform are calculated and converted to CET tokens. The CET tokens are then distributed back to traders depending on the transaction volumes.

CoinEx employs a transparent method of token distribution as all transaction fees collected and how they are distributed are displayed on the site in real-time.

To be part of the coin distribution, users must be verified, and only those with a minimum of 100 CET tokens will get a share of the tokens. All token holders will receive their dividends at the start of the next day.

Though the CoinEx cryptocurrency exchange is fairly new in the market, it had in a short time impressed lots of traders with its cutting-edge technologies. What’s also impressive about the exchange is the fact that it’s got a good number of coins which can be traded on the platform and incredibly low fees.

What are your opinions. Let me know.

Have a nice day!",1530822417,05/07/2018 20:26:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wdsy0/new_coinex_exchange_trade_driven_mining/,1

WitLess Mining - Removing Signatures from Bitcoin Cash,"#WitLess Mining


_**A Selfish Miner Variant to Remove Signatures from Bitcoin Cash**_

WitLess Mining is a hypothetical adversarial hybrid fork leveraging a variant of the selfish miner strategy to remove signatures from Bitcoin Cash. By orphaning blocks produced by miners unwilling to blindly accept WitLess blocks without validation, a miner or cartel of collaborating miners with a substantial, yet less than majority, share of the total Bitcoin Cash network hash power can alter the Nash equilibrium of Bitcoin Cash’s economic incentives, enticing otherwise honest miners to engage in non-validated mining. Once a majority of network hash power has switched to non-validated mining it will be possible to steal arbitrary UTXOs using invalid signatures - even non-existent signatures. As miners would risk losing all of their prior rewards and fees were signatures to be released that prove their malfeasance, it could even be possible to steal coins using non-existent transactions, leaving victims no evidence to prove the theft occurred.

WitLess Mining introduces two new data structures, the WitLess Transaction (`wltx`) and the WitLess Transaction Input (`wltxin`). These data structures are modifications of their standard counterpart data structures, Transaction (`tx`) and Transaction Input (`txin`), and can be used as drop-in replacements to create a WitLess Block (`wlblock`). These new structures provide WitLess Miners signature-withheld (WitLess) transaction data sufficient to reliably update their local UTXO sets based on the transactions contained within a WitLess block while preventing validation of the transaction signature scripts. 

The specific mechanism by which WitLess Mining transaction and block data will be communicated among WitLess miners is left as an exercise for the reader. The author suggests it may be possible to extend the existing Bitcoin Cash gossip network protocol to handle the new WitLess data structures. Until WitLess Mining becomes well-adopted, it may be preferable to implement an out-of-band mechanism for releasing WitLess transactions and blocks as service. In order to offset potential revenue reduction due to the selfish mining strategy, the WitLess Mining cartel might provide a distribution service under a subscription model, offering earlier updates for higher tiers. An advanced distribution system could even implement a per-block bidding option, creating a WitLess information market.

Regardless of the distribution mechanism chosen, the risk having their blocks orphaned will provide strong economic incentive for rational short-term profit-maximizing agents to seek out WitLess transaction and block data. To encourage other segments of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem to adopt WitLess Mining, the WitLess data structures are designed specifically to facilitating malicous fee-based transaction replacement:

* The `lock_time` field of `wltx` can be used to override the corresponding field in the standard form of a transaction, allowing the sender to introduce an arbitrary delay before their transaction becomes valid for inclusion in a block.
* The `sequence` field of `wltxin` can be used to override the corresponding field in the standard form of a transaction input, allowing the sender to set a lower sequence number thereby enabling replacement even when the standard form indicates it is a final version.

It is expected that fee-based transaction replacement will be particularly popular among malicious users wishing to defraud 0-conf accepting merchants as well as the vulnerable merchants themselves. The feature is likely to encourage higher fees from the users resulting in their WitLess transaction data fetching a premium price under subscription- or market-based distribution. Malicious users may also be interested in subscribing directly to a WitLess Mining distribution service in order to receive notification when the cartel is in a position to reliably orphan non-compliant blocks, during which time their efforts will be most effective. 

###WitLess Block - `wlblock`
The `wlblock` is an alternate serialization of a standard `block`, containing the set of `wltx` as a direct replacement of the `tx`  records. The `hashMerkleRoot` of a `wlblock` should be identical to the corresponding value in the standard `block` and can verified to apply to a set of `txid` by constructing a Merkelized root of `txid_commitments` from the `wltx` set. The same proof of work validation that applies to the standard block header also ensures legitimacy of the `wltx` set thanks to a WitLess Commitment included as an input to the coinbase `tx`. 


###WitLess Transaction - `wltx`

|Field Size | Description | Data type | Comments|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|4 | version | int32_t | Transaction data format version as it appears in the corresponding `tx`|
|2 | flag | uint8_t[2] | Always 0x5052 and indicates that the transaction is WitLess|
|1+|  wltx_in count | var_int | Number of WitLess transaction inputs (never zero)|
|41+ |  wltx_in | wtx_in[] | A list of 1 or more WitLess transaction inputs or sources for coins|
|1+ | tx_out count | var_int | Number of transaction outputs as it appears in the corresponding `tx`|
|9+ | tx_out | tx_out[] | A list of 1 or more transaction outputs or destinations for coins as it appears in the corresponding `tx`|
|4 | lock_time | uint32_t | The block number or timestamp at which this transaction is unlocked. This can vary from the corresponding `tx`, with the higher of the two taking precedence.|

Each `wltx` can be referenced by a `wltxid` generated in way similar to the standard `txid`.

###WitLess Transaction Input - `wltxin`

|Field Size | Description | Data type | Comments|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|36 | previous_output | outpoint | The previous output transaction reference as it appears in the corresponding `txin`|
|1+|  script length | var_int | The length of the signature script as it appears in the corresponding `txin`|
|32 or 0 | txid_commitment | char[32] | Only for the first the `wltxin` of a transaction, the `txid` of the `tx` containing the corresponding `txin`; omitted for all subsequent `wltxin` entries|
|4 | sequence | uint32_t | Transaction version as defined by the sender. Intended for replacement of transactions when sender wants to defraud 0-conf merchants. This can vary from the corresponding `txin`, with the lower of the two taking precedence.|

###WitLess Commitment Structure

A new block rule is added which requires a commitment to the `wltxid`. The `wltxid` of coinbase WitLess transaction is assumed to be `0x828ef3b079f9c23829c56fe86e85b4a69d9e06e5b54ea597eef5fb3ffef509fe`.

A `witless root hash` is calculated with all those `wltxid` as leaves, in a way similar to the `hashMerkleRoot` in the block header.

The commitment is recorded in a `scriptPubKey` of the coinbase `tx`. It must be at least 42 bytes, with the first 10-byte of `0x6a284353573e3d534e43`, that is:

     1-byte - OP_RETURN (0x6a)
     1-byte - Push the following 40 bytes (0x28)
     8-byte - WitLess Commitment header (0x4353573e3d534e43)
    32-byte - WitLess Commitment hash: Double-SHA256(witless root hash)  
    43th byte onwards: Optional data with no consensus meaning

If there are more than one `txid_commitment` matching the pattern, the one with highest output index is assumed to be the WitLess commitment.

Relationship between difficulty adjustments and bitcoin price,"I trade a little bit and was just looking over the things that could possibly be related to bitcoin price when I thought of how the block difficulty adjust roughly every two weeks could affect price. Assuming (big assumption) miners sell their bitcoin immediately, the increase in difficulty shows how much earlier the 2016 blocks were mined and how much more supply was introduced than expected on an incremental basis. In 2018 almost every two weeks the difficulty increased substantially showing that blocks were being mined faster than expected by the bitcoin architecture. This sudden and more drastic increase in “supply” if I can call it that could contribute to downwards price pressure. Does this make sense or no? I believe the difficulty increased more at each interval in 2018 than before 2018, roughly speaking timeline-wise.",1530830927,05/07/2018 22:48:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wex55/relationship_between_difficulty_adjustments_and/,1

Getting Started With Programming,"So I have a site for my store completely developed in PHP except the payment system which I waited to do last and figured it'd be straightforward to learn how to implement bitcoin payments. Come to find out Bitcoin Talk doesnt have a section, there no actual documentation on bitcoin.org, the Wiki is outdated from 2012 and even the CLI commands it used for ""getting started"" arent supported anymore its so damn old. I had an easier time figuring out monero CLI, in fact thats the only reason I could figure it out cause I knew how moneros worked and found the bitcoin commands using ""help"". So anyway I did some research before even downloading bitcoin core (I've always used electrum until I got the ambition to build my own site) and know I cant use a full node cause I only have 100 GB on my laptop and I plan on implementing LTC and monero as well and I dont have a 10 TB hard drive to store all this data on my test server (AKA my laptop). I was told there is bitcoinj thats supposed to come with Core that is supposed to not download the whole chain. But low and behold when I download it its not in there, and there is no ""bitcoin.conf"" in .bitcoin (using linux). 

Like I need to be able to write programs that generate addresses for each transaction and check for verification and then tell the server payment went through after it confirms and then tells me its time to ship the item out. It's very frustrating that when I go to the Wiki the official site tells me its so damn outdated that the librry they told me to download doesnt even own their domain anymore -.-

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PHP_developer_intro

Like seriously where am I supposed to learn how to implement bitcoin? It should be way easier to find cause I've wasted a whole day I could of been programming just trying to find some up to date documentation. And I'm weary of downloading some random PHP implementation library by some anonymous person that gets shared on Stackoverflow cause I dont have the time to go through thousands of lines of code to see if theres something malicious in it. You'd think there'd be a guide on how to use the RPC in your programs to help promote the use of the technology.

"Bought Bitcoin, or so I thought","Day before yesterday, I set out to purchase some bitcoin.  I went to the site I'd used previously, as it was the only one I'd found at the time to easily buy with a card.  This time, however, after completing a purchase of what I'd believed to be bitcoin: it turned out to be an alt currency.  Although my wallet address matched the requirement to have it sent, of course, my wallet did not/does not accept it.  It turns out the site (bitcoin dot com) has turned entirely to some other currency and now relies on a bait-and-switch in order to continue selling.

The currency is floating around at last check, and I wonder if it's lost forever.  I understand that the operators of my wallet, having the ""private key"" (I believe it's called) can right the situation if they'd be so kind - but they've chosen to ignore contact.
Can anyone advise me?  I'd be most appreciative.  Thank you.",1530845122,06/07/2018 02:45:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wginr/bought_bitcoin_or_so_i_thought/,1

Lightning network for merchants,"Hi. I’m a developer, and I’ve been implementing lightning network on my site that I’ll be launching soon as a beta test (for my app and lightning). I set up my own bitcoin and lightning (LND) node, and custom coded a payment invoice piece to receive payments. I’m guessing I’ll mostly receive small payments (hundreds to thousands of satoshis per transaction).

My concerns and questions are related around eventually withdrawing these back to the blockchain. If I end up with a bunch of people opening direct channels with me, but only sending me 500 satoshis a piece, is that going to be almost impossible to close these channels in order to eventually get it back to the blockchain? Since the btc fee might eat up all or most of these small 500 satoshi payments? Or is there someway to pool it all together somehow?

I guess this might not be as big of a problem if it ends up being where the majority of the people won’t have to open a direct channel, so I would instead only have a few open channels per hundreds/thousands of users?

I also recognize there are some future things coming to lightning that will help some of this. But I’m wondering if I have any misunderstandings as it is right now. Just trying to get some insight into what this is going to look like in the real world as of right now when I start this thing up. I have only tested with myself with a 2nd LND node to send myself some satoshis. But I’ve yet to close any channels. Anyone with real world experience with this would be appreciated. Thanks.",1530848000,06/07/2018 03:33:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wgtnu/lightning_network_for_merchants/,1

If, let us say, the multiplier for Bitcoin Enhanced falls from its current level to a modest 25%, then based on Tom Lee's target the value of a Bitcoin Enhanced token, would be $20,000 + 25% = $25,000.

"Bitcoin must go up before Christmas - Bitcoin $14,000 - explain how I'm wrong","People talk about Mt Gox, whales, bots, tether, etc. I'm sure they have some real impact. But:

1) ETFs and Cojnbase investors want Bitcoin to go up, so they can promote their ETFs on Foxnews, or equivalent (went up 100&amp;#37; i 6 months! Wow!)

Inverse ETFs are harder to explain and sell.

2) Nvidia wants Altcoin values to go up, so they can sell their new GPUs. Altcoins go up when Bitcoin goes up, because they're priced in Bitcoin. 

Nvidia wants a big launch of their 11 series GPUs. Intel is getting into the game, too.

3) ASIC makers want to sell their ASICs, so they want Bitcoin to go up.

4) It only takes 100 Million dollars, spread across 100 days, to cause the market to spike again. This is less than nothing for Coinbase/Nvidia/Intel/institutional investors.

5) When the price starts going back up, short sellers will be squeezed, again raising the price.

When it goes up some more, those short sellers will become buyers, increasing the velocity of the upward momentum.

Note that I am not saying that Bitcoin is or is not a bubble, and am not commenting on whether it will be worth lambos in 20 years. I'm saying that until 3 months after Nvidia's 11 series launches, and 3 months after the ETF funds start, Bitcoin can only go up, and up significantly. The powers that be would be fools to not make it happen, it's within their power, and they are not fools.

My prediction: Bitcoin will be manipulated to spike to 14,000 USD on or before December 1st, 2018, earlier/higher if ETFs are successfully rolled out early enough. That is high enough to temporarily reignite Altcoin mining (roughly $4-6 dollars per day per current generation GPU resulting in an apparent  6 month ROI for a new $800ish card, as well as giving ETFs a record of a 100&amp;#37; rate of returns that they can use to sell their products moving forward.

Using the main chain as an arbiter for Lightning Network and a possible attack,"I've drafted up an attack which seems to show that miners might be economically incentivised to attack the LN.

Consider the following attack:  
1) Sybil creates 2n lightning nodes and 2n channels to honest node Alice. She does so when tx fees are low at say x\_0 and batches her tx's. If done correctly it should cost her x\_0/2n per channel (negligible). She transacts in a way which prepares them all in Alice-Sybil state of (total/2 , total/2) where total is the total funds locked in the channel (this needs not be done but allows for easier math while still illustrating the problem).

2) Sybil waits until transaction fee's are high at say x\_1

3) She partitions her nodes up into two sets (SEND, RECEIVE) each of size n and routes all her available funds from SEND through Alice leaving the n SEND channels with state (total, 0) and n RECEIVE channels with state (0, total).

4) Every 10 minutes one of Sybils SEND nodes attempts to close a channel using the prior (total/2, total/2) state. 

We highlight the possibilities and pay-offs below:

Alice Contests               Alice Ignores

Alice Profit         total/2 - x\_1                  -total/2

Sybil Profit         - total/2 - x\_1              total/2 - x\_1

In the case where x\_1 &gt; total Alice should ignore rather than contest. Now Sybil doesn't profit from this attack unless she is a miner. In which case she has just added a transaction to the mempool for total/2 less than non-mining users by stealing from honest lightning nodes. The problem is compounded when attacking many Alice's and if Sybil prioritises her transactions in blocks over others.

Filling blocks with such transactions means the mempool would grow and tx fee's would grow. Further enabling this attack as then x\_1 is larger enabling this attack on larger and larger funding channels (total).

Conclusion: When fee's are high one may steal from LN nodes to subsidise DoS attacks onchain. This may have a runaway effect crippling both BTC and LN.",1530865071,06/07/2018 08:17:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8widsm/using_the_main_chain_as_an_arbiter_for_lightning/,1

BITCOIN ETH TOKEN SALE ICO LAUNCH,"Organ Tree is the first online marketplace that aims to become an organ donation ecosystem powered by Blockchain. The project aims to break taboos and norms with an ambitious vision that could save the lives of millions on a global level. With decentralization at the core of Organ Tree’s proprietary technology, the project is developing a seamless system backed by a legal framework to streamline networking between organ donors, recipients, and medical entities.

Organ Tree believes decentralization is the answer to bridging the gap between supply and demand in the organ transplant industry. With a database of 20K+ active members, Organ Tree hopes to solve a global crisis - a lack of communication between people willing to donate organs and insurance companies struggling to keep their patients alive with standard healthcare methods.

Large bitcoin purchase,"Hello everybody,

Just wanted to pick your brains for the next question.   
How do institutional investors usually buy considerable amount of bitcoins ? Say 30k bitcoins in 90 days with each day purchase of around 200-300 bitcoins.   


Do they get considerable discounts in the current market ? or they don't because it is a bear market and a few people are willing to sell. Do they search for huge mining operations and facilitate agreements with them ? or maybe simply use several crypto exchanges ?  


How do u see intermediary could benefit from facilitating such a deal ? ( I mean not an exchange or broker, but a ""deal maker"" bringing both sides of the deal to the table). How would you organize supply of 300 bitcoins per day to a willing buyer ?

Thanks",1530881187,06/07/2018 12:46:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wjs0h/large_bitcoin_purchase/,1

A.I use cases on a bitcoin blockchain data set (Our project),"We are working on a project where we take the bitcoin blockchain data set (170+ GB) and use A.I (machine learning) for prediction and classification.

We are halfway through the project and wanted to get some feedback from the community on how should we proceed with our A.I use case. We dont want to force A.I in it. But rather define A.I usecases which we can be used on a blockchain dataset.

We are trying to do the following,

1. Identify owners of bitcoin wallets addresses (much work has already been done and we are just building on top of other research).

2. Classify transactions according to market segments (eCom, Trading, Investments etc).

3. Identify set of transactions and then link them to users

4. Observe the spending pattern of a user

5. Use classification and clustering to group market segments

Do you have any suggestions on how can we use A.I on this kind of data set ?   P.S: This is an experiment, hobby project.",1530882165,06/07/2018 13:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wjvvd/ai_use_cases_on_a_bitcoin_blockchain_data_set_our/,1

Trades between cryptocurrencies are now taxable in Finland,"Some time ago there was a thread warning about taxes in Sweden. Now Finnish tax collector has changed their rules without warning. Actually the change took place more than a month ago, but there was no announcement until now. From now on trades between cryptocurrencies are taxable, but still losses are not deductable. This makes any trading basically impossible, as one would have to pay 30 &amp;#37; tax from every gain but no deductions from losses.

Metcalfe’s Law,"**Metcalfe's law** states the effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2).

Example: two phones, one possible connection. Three phones, three connections.  4 phones, 6 connections.  5 phones, 10 connections, ... 20 phones, 190 possible connections...

This makes sense when the number of connected users is relatively small.

**However**, when you have 10 million users, and you add one more, I don't think the 10,000,001st user makes much difference, especially when compared to adding one user to a network that has only ten.  Rather than E = n\*n, where E grows unbounded, I see the plot of E vs n should be more of an ""S""-shaped curve, where it ramps up in the beginning, then levels off.

For example, watch a commercial jet leave the runway.  Oh, sure, at first it's gaining altitude quite rapidly, say, 1000 feet per minute.  You could extrapolate that for half of a 4 hour flight and conclude that - mid-way - the jet will reach an altitude of 2 \* 60 \* 1000 = 120,000 ft.  But the reality is, after a few minutes, the jet levels off at 32,000 ft and stays there.

Running lightning on smartphone?,"We hear a lot about running bitcoin/lightning on raspi. This is good for a very narrow hackereaque audience. Most people are not interested in hacking around with a raspberry pi.

Most people do have smartphones and if there is good UX (I know, but hear me out), one could simply download an app and load it with a small amount of bitcoin and hope to earn some fees from routing. 

I would do this and am guessing most ordinary users would too. 

The current UX for lightning has to improve by an order of magnitude but for the purposes of hoping to earn passive fees, it does not matter.

Am I the only one who thinks Tom Lee is a Fucking Dip Shit???,"I'm assuming most of you have seen the CNBC clips where Tom Lee makes consistently wrong predictions. 

Now he is saying that because we are below mining costs in the U.S. that means we will triple in price by the end of year... We all know that this prediction will also turn out to be wrong as well. 

This idea that the price cannot go below current mining costs is totally false. Its a myth. 

People have been mining Bitcoin at every price it was ever at. If the price falls significantly, then those that are mining at a high costs will be screwed, and it will make way for new competitors to enter the space.

Bitcoin is backed by more than gold and fiat combined.,"Gold is ""backed"" by nothing other than scarcity (supply) and utility (demand).

Fiat is backed entirely by the level of confidence in that countries treasury, central bank and government to be fiscally responsible. Because a lack of fiscal responsibility kills scarcity and therefore also utility.

Bitcoin is backed by stricter scarcity than gold, greater utility than both gold and fiat, and the fact we dont have to trust in anyone.

So one day 1 satishi=1 usd and they add 2 more zeros so that 1 satoshi will be 100 usd :/ cos we added 2 more decimal places with satoshis?
Im confused please im nOt fudding i just want to understand this better. 

So if 1 satoshi is 1 usd
Then they add 2 more decimal places. The. The value of the last 2 wont count as satoshi ? 
I mean 0.00000001 = 1 usd and if they add 2 more zeroes 

 then the value will still be 1 usd but be written like this ? 0.0000000100 ?
Is this correct ? But wouldnt this be 100 satoshi ? 
Or satoshie cannot surpass after eight decimal places ?

Moon Math Update: The Truth Machine,"Someone sent me a DM asking about Noob DCA Vol. 8. Probably not any time soon (178 days remain in the noob DCA). My view since the [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qbln5/moon_math_update_noob_dca_strategy_second_edition/) hasn't changed substantially. Instead, I'm suggesting a new book that helps me interpret [Moon Math](https://www.moonmath.win) in new ways.

# Search for Knowledge

When a market is down and volatility drops it can help to step back and look at the the thing you're investing in. What is Bitcoin? Where has it been? What is Bitcoin's value proposition? What are relevant industries and where are those going?

It's time to search for new knowledge, but I can't transfer knowledge to you through Moon Math. Moon Math doesn't need to do that. You can acquire knowledge for yourself by reading and reimagining. Come back and look at moon math and use your new frameworks to interpret the implications of the projections you see drawn for you in Moon Math.

# The Truth Machine

[The Truth Machine: The Blockchain and the Future of Everything](https://amzn.to/2NvzBrR).

[This interview with
Sweetbridge CEO Scott Nelson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dla42bY7k90) provides a sense of the conversation you're starting with [The Truth Machine](https://amzn.to/2NvzBrR). 

It can be hard to to quickly summarize the many industries and platforms that are still waiting for integrations that make their lives easier. Questioning those fundamentals lead traders to more questions about Bitcoin's value proposition. 

In the 1990s it was assumed that personal computers would revolutionize productivity in the workplace. Instead, as computing power has increased we've seen productivity level off. Where are promised gains in productivity? To find ways that computers and networks have changed our lives we have to look at how the composition of markets have changed. In kind, [The Truth Machine](https://amzn.to/2NvzBrR) provides a framework to evaluate value proposition by showing how Bitcoin and blockchains might change markets.

# Digital Gold

Previously, Moon Math has been pushing a history of bitcoin that narrates it's growth through the collapse of MtGox.

[Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money](https://amzn.to/2KVMeuD)

[Digital Gold](https://amzn.to/2KVMeuD) is excellent reading for anybody who has been making comparisons between our current market and the 2014 - 2015 bear market. Nathaniel Popper applies journalistic investigation to observe individuals, communities, and businesses creating the framework for Bitcoin that we see today.

If you have a friend who is just getting into Bitcoin and wants to understand where we've been and how this all started, give them [Digital Gold](https://amzn.to/2KVMeuD). This is required reading for traders who speculate on longer time frames--especially if they've been in this market for less than two years.

Will we have a problem with lightning and mass adoption?,"Before you call me a concern troll or a ""BCASH SHILL!"" I'd like to ask a question regarding LN. I've questioned LN several times, and always get stapled as a bad actor. Please read my question in full, and please tell me why i could be wrong, instead of yelling names. I don't mind being wrong, which is why I'm challenging my beliefs here.

Ok, so imagine a scenario where LN is completely done, and ready for mass adoption. It can scale infinitely without problems. BTC is as it is today, with SegWit, and a 1MB blocksize. 

Our goal is to replace payment processors like Visa, Mastercard or Paypal. 

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/279257/number-of-credit-cards-in-circulation-worldwide/), Visa had 883 Million credit-cards in 2012. We won't have to process every transaction on every card, but we have to fund each channel for LN to work properly. Here we can assume, one creditcard = one payment channel in LN. Having only one payment channel is not really optimal, but it can be enough for things to work, so we will make that a minimum requirement.

Lets set a relatively small goal of having 600 million channels, 3/4 of visas size. In this imaginary scenario, everybody is ready to use LN, so they fund their channels. if we imagine there is no other activity on the blockchain, and these transactions are the only ones allowed any blockspace, it is going to take a very long time.  

Transactions pr day(TPD) = TPS*60*60*24, and with a TPS of 7(full SegWit adotion), we get 690 000 transactions pr day.

GOAL/TPD = 600 000 000/691 200 = 868 days. It will take us about 2.4 years of full blocks to simply fund our channels, while channel liquidity is still a question, and might need more added later.

Thats 2.4 years just to set up 600M. If a node you're connected to shuts down for good, you would need to refund another channel, and possibly sweep funds from the old unused channel, adding at most 2 more transactions on the blockchain, clogging it even more. 

Now this scenario is not really realistic, as blocks are processing other transactions, and people would never be boarding LN en masse from the beginning. This would make BTC clogged for the rest of the users for years.

Theres also a chicken and egg argument regarding LN, in several cases.

As a user, it could be hard to use LN, as proper liquidity might be a challenge. Liquidity will be a smaller problem the more channels are funded, or the more users there are. You dont want to waste your time and money to use an ineffective (with low liquidity) system.

Now we have users that don't want to waste time and money on a currently inefficient payment solution, Merchants that won't accept it, because customers don't use it, and it could take a lot of work to get a payment portal going.

I dont understand how LN could lead to mass adoption of Bitcoin, even with all these benefits its got in the made up scenario. Segwit at 100%, you only needing one channel, and with all the blockspace allocated to these transactions. This also only accounts for 3/4 of Visa, which isnt even half of all credit cards.


LN is a really cool, interesting Idea, with an actual usecase. I do however doubt that we will ever get to a point where LN becomes a global payment system for everyone to use.

[I made a post a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8uy7uq/will_segwit2x_ever_happen/) to ask If a hardfork could help solve this problem, before LN takes off properly, and if it was viable.

Will we get a problem with Lightning Network and mass adoption?,"Before you call me a concern troll or a ""B**SH SHILL!"" I'd like to ask a question regarding LN. I've questioned LN several times, and always get stapled as a bad actor. Please read my question in full, and please tell me why i could be wrong, instead of yelling names. I don't mind being wrong, which is why I'm challenging my beliefs here.

Ok, so imagine a scenario where LN is completely done, and ready for mass adoption. It can scale infinitely without problems. BTC is as it is today, with SegWit, and a 1MB blocksize. 

Our goal is to replace payment processors like Visa, Mastercard or Paypal. 

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/279257/number-of-credit-cards-in-circulation-worldwide/), Visa had 883 Million credit-cards in 2012. We won't have to process every transaction on every card, but we have to fund each channel for LN to work properly. Here we can assume, one creditcard = one payment channel in LN. Having only one payment channel is not really optimal, but it can be enough for things to work, so we will make that a minimum requirement.

Lets set a relatively small goal of having 600 million channels, 3/4 of visas size. In this imaginary scenario, everybody is ready to use LN, so they fund their channels. if we imagine there is no other activity on the blockchain, and these transactions are the only ones allowed any blockspace, it is going to take a very long time.  

Transactions pr day(TPD) = TPS*60*60*24, and with a TPS of 7(full SegWit adotion), we get 690 000 transactions pr day.

GOAL/TPD = 600 000 000/691 200 = 868 days. It will take us about 2.4 years of full blocks to simply fund our channels, while channel liquidity is still a question, and might need more added later.

Thats 2.4 years just to set up 600M. If a node you're connected to shuts down for good, you would need to refund another channel, and possibly sweep funds from the old unused channel, adding at most 2 more transactions on the blockchain, clogging it even more. 

Now this scenario is not really realistic, as blocks are processing other transactions, and people would never be boarding LN en masse from the beginning. This would make BTC clogged for the rest of the users for years.

Theres also a chicken and egg argument regarding LN, in several cases.

As a user, it could be hard to use LN, as proper liquidity might be a challenge. Liquidity will be a smaller problem the more channels are funded, or the more users there are. You dont want to waste your time and money to use an ineffective (with low liquidity) system.

Now we have users that don't want to waste time and money on a currently inefficient payment solution, Merchants that won't accept it, because customers don't use it, and it could take a lot of work to get a payment portal going.

I dont understand how LN could lead to mass adoption of Bitcoin, even with all these benefits its got in the made up scenario.

Crypto transferring wealth from america and distributing in world circulation.,"You get your paycheck on Friday, you go to your choice spot to convert your fiat over to the digital asset. You hit the exchanges hard this particular weekend. Things don't work out and you lose a large amount of your crypto. Now think about this from a larger perspective. In an essence you have just taken money from US circulation, and put it into global circulation. This can be a big problem in the long run being as America has alot of wealth to lose. Also, smaller less wealth countries will gain greatly even if the asset doesn't go directly to their banks. They now have access to this asset that they did not before. Now, My point is this, why is the government so slow to see this. They should be researching and embracing this technology so America can stay in control. However, they just dismiss it as if it is a joke. Any thoughts?",1530913565,06/07/2018 21:46:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wo0lb/crypto_transferring_wealth_from_america_and/,1

BIP for 1 Bitcoin = Ten Million Satoshis,"I know this sounds crazy but hear me out. Past a certain point, people don't look into bitcoin because they see it as being too expensive.

If we change the definition of one bitcoin by moving the decimal place, all that would need to happen is for exchanges and wallets to update their UI and price the new bitcoin accordingly at $660 per coin.

If the interfaces started only dealing with satoshis as the unit of bitcoin, and provided an interface showing $660 per 10 million satoshis, I think we would see many more people getting on board, even though there is no change to the underlying value against the dollar.

What do you all think?",1530947262,07/07/2018 07:07:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wrfe9/bip_for_1_bitcoin_ten_million_satoshis/,1

How would finance work in a hyperbitcoinized world?,"How could anybody borrow any bitcoin on a long term loan, say for a house or a business? The X number of bitcoins you borrow today, when taken on a long term loan, would become extremely expensive after a while. For a salaried home owner, getting paid in bitcoin, it means he will be paid with less and less bitcoin, since its value keeps appreciating. In the business loan case, your goods or services will be sold for less and less bitcoin as bitcoin value increases. So how could a long term loan in bitcoin ever be successfully paid off?   


Further, as bitcoin is deflationary, hoarding (hodling) it already works well in safeguarding my future needs, so why would I want to risk loaning it? Unless the interest is significant. Which probably means that, in a hyperbitcoinized world, interest rates would be extremely high?

Bitcoin transaction fees do not directly correlate with market cap.,"Yo guys... I'm confused as fuck... I don't understand why Bitcoins transaction fees are not directly correlated with BTC price. Are they determined by volume perhaps? I mean if you look at the transaction price it's generally correlated with price, but for instance, the current transaction fee is about the same as it was in January 2017 while the market cap is way higher.

Also, looking at posts and videos from early/mid last year, such as Morgan Spurlock's 'the inside man' and endless others, they all talk about how BTC is/was going to save money on transaction fees compared to banks. This claim now is preposterous... The transaction fees are oft times exorbitant, making anything less than a $100 transaction charity to miners.

US Bond Yield continues to decrease but USD value is increasing?!?!,"Hey guys, I am sorry if this comes off as sort of like a conspiracy, but I have an EXTREMELY DIFFICULT time understanding what on earth is going on in the traditional markets.

If we look at the USD, we all know that its value has seen a slight rally recently - due mainly to the fact that the Fed is saying they are doing quantitative tightening. What I expected was that US Bond Yields will begin to increase, however what I see is the complete opposite. This defies all financial understanding that I have. The only explanation that I can think of is that the Fed is lying - in which case the market buys the USD in anticipation for US Bond Yield to increase, so the USD had the recent rally. However turns out that the Fed is NOT doing quantitative tightening and in fact extending quantitative easing - in which case the USD will reverse and plummet in price again, US Bond Yield stays down and the stock markets go up.

Or US Bond Yield will increase in a few weeks? Anyway if the US Bond Yield does not increase, then they are clearly lying to us.

What this means is that the US Dollar will enter hyper-inflation very fast and there will likely be a reset - where we really see Gold/Silver/Bitcoin/Properties/Commodities play a huge part in the financial system and the US Dollar will become irrelevant.

Or am I crazy? This is actually getting quite scary",1530969546,07/07/2018 13:19:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wt3to/us_bond_yield_continues_to_decrease_but_usd_value/,1

Ways to get real sat/Bitcoins without the need and process to register at exchanges,"This post is for people who are interested in Bitcoin and Crypto but have no idea how to get bitcoin. 

All you need is a btc wallet. 
Altcoins or a gpu to mine altcoins.

*Here are a few ways to get bitcoins:*


**Get on an exchange**
You can buy bitcoin at several exchanges like bittrex, binance, bitcoin.de etc. You have to register, send money to the exchange 
and you can buy bitcoin. Or have a look at localbitcoins.com and buy directly from people in you neighborhood. 


**Accept Bitcoin** 
You could start accepting bitcoin for your business and earn bitcoin the way you'd earn money. 


**Mine Crypto**
To get started with crypto at all, you could mine altcoins and swap them for btc.

You could look out for coins, that are mineable on your GPU and swap them for bitcoin.

So you'll get the good ol' day feeling where bitcoins were still mineable on normal GPUs, you learn something about mining and eventually you can get real bitcoin. 


**swap altcoins for Bitcoin**

People who already own crypto can swap them for bitcoin easily.
Swapping for several coins is possible at https://www.shapeshift.io or https://vertpig.com for instance - no registry needed at all - a little fee may be paid though. 

you would just need a bitcoin wallet (always use one, where you own the keys!) and you are ready to go.

have fun.

"I don't see bitcoin as a currency, but there is niche. Proof me wrong please","I don't see bitcoin as a new better dollar. 


For dollar to become a world currency they made world war 2. It's not easy to establish world currency. I don't see bitcoin doing anything like this. 


But bitcoin can be a better(?) paypal. That's actually how I use it, I pay for freelance services. Bitcoin is paypal. Why is it better paypal? - because it's doesn't belong to some american company, that's it, you don't feel fucked in the ass by some capitalist when you use it. However it is nothing really more than a p2p payment system. 1 and 2nd world countries can't even buy bitcoin anonymously, it goes through the bank to exchange only then to a wallet - it is like paypal. Paypal, webmoney, e-gold and other e-payment companies fight for their piece of market, but bitcoin is ""crowd-funded"" and can become number 1 e-payment system. No future beyond this, no danger to bank system in close future or what so ever.

Why bitcoin will act as a safe haven during the next financial crisis.,"This topic has been debated a lot lately. ""If stocks crash what will bitcoin do?"".

The amount of leverage in the banking system is at record highs, with banks seemingly over-exposed to the most over-valued and fragile markets in their own regions.

The next recession/equity crash will not leave banks unaffected. 

Over the last decade QE and historically low interest rates have fuelled bubbles in all assets. Everything in G20 countries looks over-valued.

What is the silent nightmare scenario? Stagflation. A period of rising inflation while simultaneously being in a recession.

This is important because no central bank wants to fight a recession where they have to lower interest rates while simultaneously fighting rising inflation where they need to raise interest rates. Afterall, how can you raise rates and lower rates at the same time.

They know 2008 is going to happen again, and banks are going to fail again, but next time because of the last decade of extreme ""easy money"" inflation will rage unabated. So how can they keep a lid on inflation at the same time a financial crisis hits? Instead of printing money to bail-out banks, fueling inflation, they will allow banks to bail-in customer deposits, this takes money directly out of the hands of average citizens and the less money they have to spend the less inflation will rise. 

Over the last few years the EU, UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have ALL legislated bail-in law making it completely legal for failing banks to confiscate customer deposits to remain liquid and protect their balance sheets.

Seems perfect, save the banks and put a brake on inflation at the same time. This way rates can be lowered again in the next crisis without worrying about inflation.

The problem with this of course is bitcoin exists. The demand for gold and bitcoin in a period of bail-ins will be astromomical. Would you rather buy bitcoin and deal with its volatility or see a bank take 50% of your money. What if you hold $100,000 in a bank and bail-in law allows banks to take 50% of everything over $50,000, you are going to want to protect that money by holding cash under your matress or buying bitcoin, and bitcoin is just a little bit easier to store than $50,000 in $100 bills under your matress. 

Plus dont forget Cyprus in 2013, during this time cash withdrawls will be basically impossible with a restriction on how much you are allowed to withdraw per week. The only option left is to wire money out to buy bitcoin.

Introduction &amp; Running a full node on the BTC network!,"Hey everyone,

Allow me to shortly introduce myself. I'm a 23 year old Bitcoin enthusiast for many years now and about to graduate my Software Engineering bachelor in the Netherlands by doing research on the subject of blockchain consensus algorithms. 

Even though as a student I don't own the funds to possess a 'relevant' amount of Bitcoin, I still find it important help out Bitcoin where I can. That's why as of now I'm 'permanently' running a full Bitcoin node at [62.45.85.167:8333](https://62.45.85.167:8333) for the sake of contributing to what I believe is a revolutionary invention. According to [https://bitnodes.earn.com/](https://bitnodes.earn.com/) this means that I am one of only &lt; 10.000 active full nodes worldwide as we speak! (yay)

Starting from today I'm planning to really become active here on r/Bitcoin. So thank you all for having me!\~",1530981919,07/07/2018 16:45:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wuh4w/introduction_running_a_full_node_on_the_btc/,1

The US Federal Reserve stopped publishing their Federal Reserve Balance Sheet,"This is a follow up to my previous post here on this subreddit.

As you can see in the link below, the May 2018 Federal Reserve Balance Sheet is missing - and it has been 2 months already. Why would they stop publishing this?

They claimed that they were going to do quantitative tightening, but what we are currently seeing is the exact opposite in the US 10-year Bond Yield. Price of USD increased against other fiat currencies in anticipation for this.

If they published the balance sheet, then every single person will know that they do not intend whatsoever in quantitative tightening.

Development of the Wealthman platform goes according to the Scrum methodology with the selected sprint period of 2 weeks.,"The development of the Wealthman platform goes according to the Scrum methodology with the selected sprint period of 2 weeks. The recent sprint we have completed 06.07.2018, during which we coded the system of remuneration of wealth-managers at the level of smart contract, and significantly upgraded backend. Public source code is available on https://github.com/WealthMan/WEALTHMAN_SMART_CONTRACT/.

Internal tests have shown that the investor's end-to-end business process is not optimized. Therefore, we decided to postpone testing the alpha version until the end of the next sprint, ie 21.07.2018.

Spent some btc!,"Just wanted to share my own experience with hodling and my recent experience with spending my Bitcoin.

I got into crypto during Thanksgiving when my brother-in-law brought up the subject of Bitcoin just like so many others. The growing pains of exchanges and trying to get registered and once more waiting for money orders to clear in trying to buy as much btc as I responsibly could afford. After New year's rolled around my acitivity on exchanges slowed way down and I became a staunch hodler, crossing my fingers for the days of ath returning.

Then the NBA play offs came around and I found that a certain online betting site was accepting Bitcoin. Well, I won my bet on Golden State winning the finals and after couple other bets here and there my initial buy in of .2 btc became .3 btc!

what a US exchange traded Bitcoin ETF would most likely look like,"some thoughts on what a US exchange traded Bitcoin ETF would most likely look like

1.  the ETF will NOT own actual BTC, but would instead own BTC futures contracts... 

a.  the most likely structure would be to own the prompt month contract and then to roll out of that contact 1-2 weeks prior to contract expiration and into the next forward month

b.  less likely structures would be to own a simple weighted average 12 month strip of the futures contracts

c.  later on, BTC ETFs may be leveraged directional plays that are  2x or 3x's  positive/negative of the daily BTC price change (based on a certain time cutoffs per day as BTC is a 24/7 market)


2.  the ETF will charge 2% to 3% in management fees (to the highest fee side of the ETF world)

3.  the ETF will have relatively large tracking error, relative to other commodity/financial ETFs


4.  the ETF would have low AUM - assets under management


5.  the ETF will most likely trade a large positive premium to NAV (not a good thing)


6.  on the plus side, the ETF will be very affordable and very accessible (assuming your brokerage does not restrict purchase of it)

on the first point.. if you believe the tail wags the dog (that futures markets moves the underlying), this is bullish.

if you believe that the tail does NOT wag the dog (the futures market does NOT move the underlying), then the advent of BTC ETFs will likely not impact BTC's underlying price",1531012655,08/07/2018 01:17:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wy039/what_a_us_exchange_traded_bitcoin_etf_would_most/,1

Making Lightning Invoices backwards compatible with standard BIP21 URIs.,"This post describes how lightning invoices can be embedded into a standard BIP-21 URI, such that standard wallets that do not implement lightning can pay directly to the on-chain address, while wallets that implement lightning can see that the request contains a lightning invoice, and use that instead, falling back to the on-chain address if necessary. This could be useful for services that accept payment both on-chain and off-chain, as they would only need to show one QR code, and the wallet would extract the data it needs automatically.

Bitcoin has a standard format for generating address URIs and QR codes, called [BIP-21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki). This format encodes a payment request with the format `bitcoin:bc1mybitcoinaddress`. However, these request can contain much more data, for example the URI `bitcoin:bc1mybitcoinaddress?amount=0.01&amp;message=Reckless` specifies that the wallet should automatically fill-in the amount of 0.01 Bitcoins, and store it with the message ""Reckless"".

[BOLT-11](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md) is the standard for how lightning invoices are generated. BOLT-11 invoices look very different from BIP-21 URIs, but serve much the same function. Instead of storing an address and some metadata, it stores a public key, payment hash, and a few other LN specific things. It also optionally stores a fallback on-chain address, but I find this approach deficient for a few reasons. First, BOLT-11 invoices cannot be read by standard Bitcoin wallets, defeating the entire purpose of having a fallback on-chain address, unless it is only meant to be used in case of routing failure. Additionally, it re-implements well defined functionality that already works with BIP-21, which is implemented by every Bitcoin wallet. However, BOLT-11 defines an alternative solution that I would like to explore:

&gt;If a URI scheme is desired, the current recommendation is to either use 'lightning:' as a prefix before the BOLT-11 encoding (note: not 'lightning://'), or for fallback to bitcoin payments to use 'bitcoin:', as per BIP-21, with the key 'lightning' and the value equal to the BOLT-11 encoding.

This seems much more interesting. If we encode payment requests that are allowed to be fulfilled EITHER on-chain or off-chain as `bitcoin:bc1mybitcoinaddress?lightning=lnbc1mybolt11lightninginvoice`, this solves the issue of backwards compatibility. A standard Bitcoin wallet could scan this URI and say ""I don't know what this lightning thing is, so I'll just ignore it"", and send the payment on-chain to bc1mybitcoinaddress. However, a lightning-enabled wallet could scan the same request, notice the lightning-specific data, and choose to ignore the on-chain address in favor of the lightning invoice. Then, if there is a routing error, the lightning wallet can fall back to the provided on-chain address (assuming the amount to be paid is above the dust limit).

This would improve the user experience, because a user checking out at an online store would not see Bitcoin and Lightning Bitcoin as two separate options. This would transform lightning - in the eyes of everyday users at least - from a completely separate network to an optional optimization that really isn't any different from normal Bitcoin. Users wouldn't have to know what a Lightning payment is, or how it differs from a regular Bitcoin payment: if their wallet supports it, it will use it.

There are, however, some downsides to this approach. Namely, data such as amount, description, and label would have to be duplicated in both the BIP-21 and BOLT-11 parts of the payment request. This isn't that big of a deal, because payment request URIs should NOT be entered manually by hand anyway.

As far as I am aware, no lightning wallets currently implement this behavior, but I am communicating with (for some definition of communicating) the creator of Bitcoin Lightning Wallet to get these features integrated.",1531018873,08/07/2018 03:01:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8wyloi/making_lightning_invoices_backwards_compatible/,1

What could precipitate a bitcoin jump again?,"The two main possibilities I see/ have heard about that could result in a bitcoin price jump are bitcoin etfs and institutional investing.

A lot of people writing articles and publishing YouTube videos seem to think bitcoin etfs are the key. But why? I understand it would be a step towards acceptance, but only in the USA. I believe Europe already has bitcoin products available. I imagine a similar introduction in the USA would help the price but not a ton. I also the the futures market for bitcoin now is potentially limiting volatility because people can have more effective hedging strategies. So less possibility for jump.

Also people contend that institutional involvement will be the key to a price jump. I’m not sure people know this but trading firms (large ones) trade massive amounts of bitcoin already. I work for the IT dept in a firm that deals with options market making and we already have a bitcoin team. Moreover we have an inventory of cold storage bitcoin that is massive. As in billions of dollars worth. My point is bitcoin trading is already huge. So there will never be new development with that really. The only thing that could make a difference is bank involvement but that’s neither guaranteed nor soon to happen.

Destinia My Review,"So after expedia stopped accepting btc I was looking for an alternate found these guys and want to inform you of my exp.

Pros: 

1. Very responsive on email, facebook and phone.
2. They accept bitcoin for everything.

Cons:

1. Shady btc acceptance will write in detail.
2. Only accept it via bitpay
3. Double confirmation required.

So first I had problems with booking as the website would get stuck on loading. However 24 hours later I retried and everything went through fine. I booked a hotel the prices were equal if not better to other sites. After booking around 30 mins in I got a confirmation email from these guys that my hotel is booked and was provided the reference number. I emailed the hotel I booked to get a confirmation. After not receiving an email I contacted the hotel via phone the next day and was informed that there was no booking. So I emailed and after a few hours left a msg on their facebook and then called them a few hours later. On the phone I was informed it takes some time and they have emailed the hotel for confirmation so I will be informed. No time frame was given which made me think I had just wasted by btc. However the 3rd day I was sent another email by Destinia confirming my internal hotel ref numbers which I had no clue what they were. I called the hotel again they confirmed they had the reservation. I successfully checked in and checked out without any issues. They need to streamline their services on booking end. If anyone books please double confirm and not do last minute bookings. All in all I gave them a score of 4 out of 5 if they can improve on the booking process they are golden. And also bitpay is a pain so need to be replaced.",1531040201,08/07/2018 08:56:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8x08mu/destinia_my_review/,1

So I want to go to a data retrieval service. Would you guys happen to know what folders I ask them to save or try to access on the HD? I kind of figure it would not be wise to tell them I have bitcoins and I need that wallet.

Did my bitcoin get...stolen?,"Maybe I made some noob mistake here. Wracking my brain trying to figure out what happened. I had a small amount of bitcoin, about $50 I think. I kept it in my bitpay wallet, using the bitpay app on my phone. I don't really check it often, I'd say it's been like 2 or 3 months since I checked it. But I checked it today and my balance is gone. It says it was sent to some wallet on June 14th of this year. I don't recall doing anything of the sort with it. Now I was under the impression that my btc was pretty secure since it's on my phone and someone would basically have to physically have my phone to do anything with it. Was I wrong?

Can bitcoin really compete with traditional finance? Absolutely.,"Saying bitcoin wont work because it cant replace the complexity of traditional finance and money markets, is like saying automobiles will never work because they cant replace the complexity of the methods used to breed, stable, feed and train horses.

Everything traditional finance does today will be done over bitcoin programatically and probably in a completely decentralized manner.

Everything traditional finance can do today can and will be done on bitcoin except more efficient, cheaper, global and available to anyone with a $10 smart phone.

Central banking has already been automated, LN is the entire global payments industry, P2P lending with oracles and reputation will replace traditional lending, and interest rates will be based on supply and demand of savings. 

Productivity creates more supply, more supply lowers prices, lower prices lead to higher levels of savings, and higher levels of savings will lead to lower interest rates. In a world with a non-inflationary monetary medium like bitcoin there is no upper limit on productivity, no over heating of the economy. Inflationary money like fiat requires high interest rates and high unemployment to prevent CPI inflation, but with sound money increased productivity and zero unemployment just leads to increased supply and declining prices of goods and services for all. 

Bitcoin will do everything traditional finance does but better and available for everyone everywhere, all while allowing us to live in our natural state of low/no unemployment, low interest rates, constantly increasing productivity and a constantly decreasing cost of living leaving everyone better off over time even if you never get a pay rise.

The countries that adopt bitcoins sound/strong monetary policy will become the switzerlands of the world while those that dont will become the venezuelas of the world. Until all countries eventually adopt btc because that will be the only way to be recognized as a legitimate nation. At that point the whole world will be on the same level playing field, making weak-currency-policy induced poverty nothing but a chapter in the history books.

Bitcoin really does take us in the right direction as a human society towards global equality by putting every human on the same level playing field.

The Soldier with the right type of Short Fuse-CRYPTOFUSE,"When researching Cryptocurrency and Blockchain on the internet one must go from link to link, website to website and so on to get to the place and the information that you require to form the proper basis for any article that one is working on. It was on a journey like this that I happened to meet a guy called Andrew Wayne Couch in a Telegram room and we got to chatting. I was of course trying to promote my website gocryptosales.com and he told me that he was new to Crypto. Here I was thinking that I could help him get to know all about Crypto and Blockchain, he played along with me and we swapped website details and after I checked his site out I realized this was no ordinary guy who I was talking to and low and behold he happened to be the CEO and founder of Cryptofuse.com. He then went on to explain the concept behind his company and when he told me that his technology could work offline as well as online, it didn't take me long to realize I was speaking to someone who not only was extremely intelligent but someone who could affect how future transactions of Cryptocurrency will be completed as his technology will allow customers to complete these transactions both online and offline, something which as of writing I haven't seen or believe there is such a process that allows users to exchange authorized digital currency without an internet connection anywhere in the world.

### The Cryptofuse Hardware

**SHORT FUSE** 

The Short Fuse is built to operate without an internet connection--Imagine here that two users who are either not able to or not wanting to have an internet connection but want to transfer some digital currency, well they can if they are both n possession of a short fuse, where they plug the short fuse into a laptop for example and on screen they will see an option that will allow the transfer of digital currency.The short fuse application also verifies the transaction, updates each local device to show the new balance and micro mines the currency to an offline of the Bytechain over the Byteblock protocol. Later one or both users can plug the short fuse into an online terminal that adds the Byteblocks to an online version of the Bytechain and updates the devices. The Byteblock protocol is not restricted only to cryptocurrency and more information about that can be found on the website, suffice to say that this use of the technology will have a major effect on how we transfer digital currencies in the future.

**QUICK FUSE**

The Quick Fuse on the other hand allows the Short Fuse to communicate with other deices using Bluetooth and NFC.The exchange of Digital Currency between Quick Fuse devices involves the same or similar steps as the ones discussed above in the Short Fuse method. To allow extreme privacy the digital transfer of digital currency between Quick Fuse devices pulls power from a Smartphone when it is offline using the Bytedrop method. The Quick Fuse also has a WI-FI and Bluetooth chip for network connectivity.

**CRYPTO FUSE**

The Crypto Fuse enables the data from the Short Fuse to be uploaded online. A Crypto fuse device can run a CryptoFuse operating system. E.G as a feature of the CryptoFuse operating system, the screen will display and receive login information, balance information, account management information and more. For a more detailed explanation of the many uses of the Crypto Fuse check the website as the white paper goes into much more detail than I can here.

**THE COIN (CBT)**

When the Bytebase exchange is live the first currency that will be available for trade is the CRYPTOBYTE (CBT). It will be the first currency in the world, that will be able to be traded both online and offline. The CryptoFuse engineers have tokenism the platform and created this first of a kind coin. Users will be able to buy from the marketplace, transfer coins from peer to peer, and into any other cryptocurrency like Bitcoin Ethereum, or NEM.

### THE BYTEBLOCK PROTOCOL

This protocol allows offline transactions of Cryptocurrency, supply line data and Smart Contracts as part of an online connected public ledger. Why is it different to anything else that has gone before? Well because Byteblock can work both online and offline for crypto, supply line and Smart Contracts. This distinction means that this protocol gives access to Blockchain technology to users and regions of the world that cannot rely on a consistent internet connection, opening up the possibility of underserved areas and countries that will allow them to connect with the entire global economy.

On the website there is also a section in the white paper that deals with **Micro Mining** and the uses of the technology in that field too and you can view that on the website too.

The Cryptofuse team headed by Andrew Wayne Couch an ex army combat veteran with years of experience in communication and encryption protocols inspired him to create technology that has led him to creating the Byteblock protocol and now along with his dedicated team they have another mission to complete and that is to build and maintain an ecosystem that provides worldwide users with the means to make transactions online and offline using Blockchain.

### How To Be Part Of Cryptofuse

The presale started in early may and there are many ways of getting involved from buying a t shirt to packages that range from around $500 to $100000 and all the details are available at cryptofuse.com Here is the customer journey you can expect from Cryptofuse

T**he Cryptofuse 5 step Customer Journey**

1.Transfer BTC to Bytebase.com get a one for one Cryptobyte (CBT) decimal trade

2.Load your CBT onto a CF device

3.Trade with other CF devices

4. Connect back to Bytebase

5. Reconcile the BB ledger

### Conclusion

Speaking from a personal view I am thoroughly excited and impressed by Cryptofuse as it is patents being approved of course will change digital currency transactions and the way we do them forever. All the elements of the hardware involved with this technology are mind blowing and quite brilliant. It is a project that I will be following all the way to its ultimate success of which I have no doubt. It goes to show you that it is not always a bad thing to have a short fuse especially if that short fuse is the Cryptofuse.

"Gamers from Bitcoin, what happened? We have to pay FOR EVERYTHING. 10 years sgo wasn't like that","Hey, I'm that type of user who got into computers because of gaming, and then I got into crypto because of computers. And I'm here to discuss about the current situation of the gaming industry... What a crap!😠

Nowadays, if you want to experience an ultimate game you have to pay for everything!! 

Value transference:
Game == pay 
Skins == pay
DLC == pay
Bonus == pay


But then, once you have used skins and want to sell it to export the value from the game there is no option. Games not only offer you the gaming experience, they also track data from your GPU, preferences, inputs...
This data has a value, and they are not giving you value for it, they are charging you!

Gaming platforms don't give you the right to have the full game, instead the give you a licence to use the game under certain conditions (usually to avoid cheats, but usually.). For more info read the steam terms and conditions.

This crappy and disgusting situation has made me wake up and fight against this industry 🙌. And the best weapon to fight is Bitcoin. Since several months I have been working in a platform powered with microtransactions via LN where:
✓ Users get paid while/for gaming.
✓ Users can extract value from the gaming platform.
✓ Users can choose a charity if they don't want the money they earn while gaming.
✓ Users have the control over the gsming industry and not the opposite.

After months of following my dream I'm so close to finally release it!

"BTC is difficult to use - Slow to purchase, slow to sell, hard to use as currency.","I think it is ridiculous that Coinbase Pro takes forever to get money into my account at 7-10 days.  I really thought they were exaggerating, but no.  That is a millennium in crypto currency time, Bitcoin could go up or down 30% in that amount of time, depositing into my account is faster but still can take a few days.  With regular cash, it's transfered into and out of my account instantly from Pay Pal, why can't crypto be the same way?  Other faster methods like Cashapp, charges 2-3% for instant purchases.

Overview of KYC/AML Laws by OCC,"## Overview of KYC/AML Laws

Criminals and terrorists have long sought out ways to legitimize their money so they can apply it toward their goals. Money laundering describes the process by which these groups hide the ownership of their money and pass it through several sources until it has the appearance of legitimacy. The criminals are looking to disguise the original source and cover their tracks as they engage in transactions all over the world. Due to the mostly unregulated aspect of cryptocurrency, many are concerned that suspicious financial activities will thrive there.

Numerous countries and companies are trying to regulate cryptocurrency transactions to prevent money laundering and are applying a number of KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) laws and requirements to various entities in an attempt to be more vigilant in preventing criminal and terrorist financing.

# History of Regulation

The idea of money laundering is nothing new, as profiting from black markets, bribes, extortion, and more has always been a priority for those who wanted to remain hidden from the law, tax-collecting governments, and enemies. Money laundering is a descriptive term for taking “dirty” money from a criminal source and passing it through enough layers of financial transactions so it appears “clean.”

For the United States, many of the modern money laundering regulations and laws came into effect in the early 20th century. Countries around the world have their own laws and they work together on an international scale to prevent suspicious activities.

As criminals develop have more sophisticated methods of hiding their money, these laws have extended to all kinds of areas, such as casinos, insurance companies, and merchants. Cryptocurrency is just the latest development to come under scrutiny for anti-money laundering laws and enforcement.

# Cryptocurrency and KYC/AML

If there is an exchange between fiat currencies and virtual currencies, the entities facilitating the exchange are required to comply with various KYC/AML regulations. However, there isn’t clear regulation at the moment for exchanges between different virtual currencies. That doesn’t mean cryptocurrency exchanges are a free-for-all of criminal activity. Instead, each individual company takes it upon themselves to perform their due diligence to conform with common-sense KYC/AML requirements.

Country-wise I think Estonia is pretty good with their e-residence and crypto licenses but the local banks deny you accounts so you will have to get an account at SEB which is not guaranteed (the other 3 foreign banks are 100 percent against crypto).

Switzerland is just too expensive for most startups.

What’s the cost of mining a Bitcoin,"
I have  read numerous articles/posts online about the cost of mining a bitcoin.  I have also heard at numerous conferences/events that the figure is at circa $4000. (No substantiation offered for this figure, but the figure I have heard muted usually sits around this value).
I have often heard it as the reasoning bitcoin won’t drop below $4000 a coin. 

Whilst I accept there will never be an exact figure for the price due to  constantly varying factors ( cost of energy,  hardware, labour/management, privacy etc etc). I do think we should be able to have an indicative cost/benchmark to create a bitcoin based on existing data. Maybe $4k is the correct figure, I am just interested in how that is calculated.
I am not trying to say there is a correlation between the cost of mining the asset V the market value, but it can help give some indication of the “value/cost” for creating the asset, at the point of creation. 
This obviously won’t factor in any future value or use cases, it is merely a means of measuring the cost of creating the digital asset for use at that point in time, based on the real world consumption costs  associated with creating it. 


Example just taken off Twitter:
The correct way to estimate Bitcoin energy usage by ######, not the invalid methodology used by Digiconomist cited in MSM FUD articles.

“Annual consumptiom: 35TW/year
Capacity: 4000MW
% world energy: 0.03% 
Cost: 1.7B$/year

Efficiency gains help offset increased consumption.
This gives a total cost of $1,700,000,000.00 for worldwide consumption. “



Based on the above “calculation” that would mean each bitcoin has a creation cost of 

1800 (bitcoins mined a day) X 365 ( days per year) = 657,000 Bitcoins a year (2018) 
 $1,700,000,000/ 657,000 = $2,587.52 per bitcoin. 

Obviously there are a lot of assumptions in the above assessment. 
-The figure doesn’t include a cost for hardware/maintenance.
-The figure doesn’t include any housing or management costs. 
-The energy $ value makes an assumption of $TW which does change considerably depending on location. 

Any links or info that would help add some meat to this would be appreciated. 

Mucho Mucho

Did you have a chance to glance at the crypto markets performance last weekend? If not, let us bring you up to speed. Yesterday, Bitcoin went on a rally and took the market to the greens with over $200 rally to break the $6800 resistance before pulling back to $6700.

Fast forward Monday, in the early Asian Markets today, the market has fallen back and volume has dropped from $12 to $11 Billion which shows a slowdown in momentum. Total market capitalization has shrunk by 1.3&amp;#37; on the day to $273 billion and could not break over the $280 billion barrier.

The lack of volume has taken most of the cryptocurrencies on the red again with most losing majority of the weekend gains.

Freewallet has got to get it together:(,"So I went to exchange some bitcoin cash for some bitcoin and I never received the bitcoin. Naturally I opened up a work ticket with free wallet and was relieved when they said that they were going to help me so quick. After not hearing from them for over three days I sent them an email followed up by another email the next day. And today I get this response.

“We have extensively researched your case, and unfortunately, we're unable to retrieve the coins sent cross-chain in your situation.

Your BCH transaction went to a Segwit BTC address (you can easily recognize one, Segwit addresses start with ""3""). 
Normally, if your coins went to a regular BTC address, we would be able to retrieve them. However, Segwit addresses are different.

The BCH chain is structurally inconsistent with the Segwit BTC chain. Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash supports Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) and Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) addresses.  
However, Segwit BTC features Pay-to-Script-Hash embedded in Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2SH-P2WPKH) addresses.

As of now, there are no official ways or tools to retrieve BCH from Segwit addresses. 
You can find quite a number of people offering to recover your BCH in such cases; however, they request sensitive information about your wallet and often demand bounties.

That is exactly why Freewallet switched to a new Bitcoin Cash address format: to avoid situations when coins are mistakenly sent to addresses with little or no chances of their recovery.

We will continue seeking ways to retrieve your coins. We do hope that Segwit developers will come up with a way to do it in the future. 
When there is one, we will complete your refund free of charge, as always.

Best regards,
Freewallet Support Team”


I mean how extensively could they have researched my particular situation? I feel like I am pretty sure that they just sent an automated response thinking that they knew what had happened..? But either way I am not satisfied and I will be continuing to ask them for help. It is just so sad that this is the actually third time that I’ve had issues with their wallet and I should have dumped it along time ago. Please use another wallet so you don’t have to be one of the hundred or so people who have to post on reddit to spread awareness.

I'm a complete noob from Venezuela and need to make money to live, so I'm considering starting a small mining rig or buying an S9. 

According to all calculators in would be profitable to do so (more with an ASIC than a rig) so I'm asking for advise on how to best proceed.

* What would the best investment be? an ASIC (S9) or a RIG?
* Which is the best pool to mine on/for?
* How would the difficulty challenge my profitability?
* Any other advice that you could give

How closing a channel on Lightning works ?,"Hello,

I don't understand how the closing of a channel on the Lightening network works ?

Here is an example :

1) Alice and Bob open a channel and each one deposit lets say 2 bitcoins in the channel

2) Alice sends her two bitcoins to Bob via Lightning :  now Bob has 4 bitcoins and Alice 0.

3) Alice wants to close the channel, so she receives 0 bitcoins (on chain) and Bob receives 4 (on chain)

On point 3, what happens if Alice denies to have sent the 2 bitcoins. Is it impossible to close the channel because Bob won't aggree and has the proof that she sent him two bitcoins ? If so, Bob is stuck with 4 bitcoins in the channel that cannot be closed. What can he do ?

Investing with Bitcoin on FinUnix.com,"Hello Humans,

Just wanted to know you you guys ever heard of this new investment company called [FinUnix.com](https://finunix.com)

Allows you to invest using Bitcoin with a minimum of 1.1% interest of on capital investment daily. 

I was wondering if this site is really what it claims it is. 

My first thoughts:

1) Website is well design and thorough tho it's only 2m old
2) Website isn't rated as spam or malicious by KSN
3) Provides proof of incorporation

Do you think this website is legit? Should we trust it?

I think I know the real reason Bitcoin has remained on top despite so many alternatives.,"This may be a stoner-ish thought, but bear with me. In addition to its 'first mover status' and all the media hype over the years, I believe one main reason Bitcoin is still the top crypto is because it is fundamentally relatable. What I mean by that is, because it uses proof of work (PoW), the general public can better relate to it because it is synonymous with the fact that they themselves must work to earn money. They like the fact that the machines must work hard to obtain a profit, because it is such a familiar concept. 

Compare that to any proof of stake (PoS) coin or token, and the same level of attraction just isn't there, because it implies that only the rich can play. Opinions?",1531157442,09/07/2018 17:30:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8xdy3b/i_think_i_know_the_real_reason_bitcoin_has/,1

Simple methods for physically protecting your Bitcoins from armed robbery and theft,"One thing about Bitcoin is that it goes back to Gold. In times where Gold (and similar currencies) were popular Robin Hood, Jesse James, and other street bandits could make fortunes robbing stage coaches in transit. If Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, times like these could come again.

While it seems far fetched, robbing a house built on fiat has the reward potential of about $25,000 tops. It's not feasible to execute a bank transfer, make a HUGE purchase on a credit card, or ATM withdrawal more than $1,000 or what not. Anything in under 1 to 2 hours is limited to $25,000.

Except with Bitcoin. Hacking an exchange, or robbing a person, has virtually unlimited potential, and millions can be transferred in minutes. It's the most profitable form of person to person armed robbery bar none, with second place capping out at around $25,000.

So what do you do?

Remove any possibility of a thief acquiring more than $25,000. Will this create some hassle? Sure, but for social leaders and millionaires, it's likely worth it. For anonymous individuals of low profile, IT IS STILL IMPORTANT, because one needs to have a good story.

During a robbery, you want to do the following:

* Assess the situation (Effectively, are these 'crack heads' or professionals? Crack heads yield to authority and can be tricked, professionals kill, torture. With professionals, your family may be threatened, etc, making reprisals unreasonable.)

* Make a token offering (Generally speaking paying up to $10,000 or so to escape a violent situation is a good spend. If the robber is a crack head, they will leave happy. One could argue all your money for your life, but I suggest positioning yourself as to where that is not an option.)

* Remove the ability to access large amounts of funds.

There are two things necessary to achieve this:

1) Attempt to PREVENT withdrawals from exchanges to unknown Bitcoin addresses, or other wallets altogether. And to put new addresses on a one-week lock. 2 Factor Authentication does nothing for you in the event of a robbery. Instead, only allow withdrawals to 1 BTC address, the one in your bank vault.

2) Make a multi-signature wallet on [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/24794/how-can-i-use-multi-signature-addresses-with-bitcoin-core) or other, 2 of 4 (or 2 of 6 or similar). Unlike other methods where the passwords are kept with friends or family, instead get FOUR safe deposit boxes in four separate banks. Within each bank keep ONE password and a USB drive for your wallet .dat file. In order to access your 'vault' you MUST visit TWO different banks, and access your safe deposit box in each.

---

For Accounting purposes, you should do the following:

All Incoming Funds -&gt; Vault BTC Address (multisig 2 of 4)

Decoy Stash (small random incoming funds, etc, transfers to Trezor, large and midsized outflows). USB drives or similar. Transfers mostly to keep up activity.

Trezor (or mobile hardware wallet) - For small outgoing purchases, minor trades, etc - mobile, safe to use on public machines.

---

**tl / dr : So in the end, you should have:**

Hot Wallet (Trezor) for shopping, trades ($5,000)

Decoy Stash ($10,000)

Real Stash, Vault - 2 of 4 multisig - in 4 Bank Lock Boxes, password in the boxes, 1 per Bank (Millions). With all incoming funds set to pay to this public address (or these public address is you have multiple businesses, etc).

Exchanges - Require pre approved BTC withdrawal addresses, new addresses 1 week delay prior to transfer, etc.

Such a setup such as that caps the ability for any armed robber to score more than $15,000 off your person, does not require (significant) coordination with family members (nor jeopardizes them), and forces your person to be transferred between two banking institutions before accessing significant funds (allowing for time to phone the police, and for them to arrive at your future destination, etc).

---

Even if you do not take these precautions, it is important to have this 'story' ready, so that you can discourage a robber from accessing your 'vault'. Simply tell them it is held in a Safe Deposit Box at 4 banks, and that you need to visit 2 of the 4 banks in order to access the funds. Such a setup takes 90 minutes for you to access funds as needed, but makes any form of extortion next to impossible. It's a highly believable story, and keeps you safe.

I am now running a 24/7 full bitcoin node!!!,"Today I really felt like running my own bitcoin full node. What I found surprising is that within just 5 minutes after running the bitcoin daemon it alreasy is at block \`213877\`! This is on Google Cloud btw, which costs my around 30$ / month. Definitly not much considering I do not need a third party to broadcast my bitcoin transactions now :) 

  
I would encourage everyone to run their own bitcoin full nodes, there are already many (around 10.000 live nodes), but we should REALLY push it to make it even more and more decentralized!

  
Very nice feeling to finally help all you nerds :)

How come that states' financial regulators can safely ignore the will of majority of population on Bitcoin?,"The short answer is that financial watch-dogs of all countries are not elected by voters - they are mostly political appointees. Hence, an absence of the real accountability. Here's an example of Kenyan central bank's position on Bitcoin.

Kenya, together with Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa, has became one of the few African nations to embrace Bitcoin. In 2013 this country served as a launched-pod for the first African internationally recognized money transmitter startup, which used Bitcoin to conduct its business. Kenya also hosts one of the largest blockchain-incubators in Africa.

Nevertheless, the Central Bank of Kenya has more than once expressed its hawkish, anti-Bitcoin position in several public memorandums. The most widely cited one is the CBK circular number 14 of December 2015, which, among other preventive measures, introduces the following: Financial Institutions are advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive will lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank.

In 2017 such aggressive stance of Kenyan financial watch-dogs towards Bitcoin resulted in several persecution cases mounted against local entrepreneurs, which used it to run their companies. At the same time, this domain remains officially unregulated in Kenya. CBK public stance on the legality of Bitcoin is the following: ... virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are not legal tender in Kenya and therefore no protection exists in the event that the platform that exchanges or holds the virtual currency fails or goes out of business. Still, there's a little doubt that in the foreseeable future Kenyan legislators will do their best to make lives of local Bitcoin-enthusiasts much more exiting than it's really necessary.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: not friendly; economic climate: relatively friendly; regions to focus: locally; industries to focus: FinTech, SAAS, on-line entertainments, e-marketplaces; major limitations: slowing GDP growth rate, high CB interest rate (10%), high taxes (individual income tax stands at 30%), population relies on subsistence agriculture and the majority of potential IT services users lives under the poverty line, rising level of ethnic tensions; stimulus: fast growing young generation of mobile Internet users, increasing importance of services sector in the overall structure of GDP, relatively high fixed Internet penetration rate (almost 50%), an expanding startup ecosystem (specially in Nairobi); opportunities: to launch a variety of services (e.g. in FinTech and entertainments) aimed at the largest cities youths. Bitcoin (outlook): non-regulated (negative).

Seriously. IF I had an accurate-enough technique to predict short term BTC price movements...,"...the LAST thing I'd be doing is posting it here.  No.  I'd be USING IT, and keeping my big mouth shut.  And then, after a while, I'd be out spending like crazy.

Remember this whenever somebody posts any kind of technical analysis or link to their prediction/what-to-do-next software/robot/formula/chart...  If it really worked, this is one of the last places they'd be spending their time.

Instead of trying to figure out how to time the market, you're better off spending that time and effort generating more income and/or cutting your expenses so you can afford to buy-and-hold more BTC long-term.

Thoughts. 

We need simplicity for the dumb people out there, everyone says crypto is dead however I havnt seen one dev stop Work because they suddenly think it’s pointless.

2. Ranked based on the profit rates, the champion(the contestant who ranks first) will be awarded 50% of the bonus pool. The rest 50% will be served as bonus for spectators who have successfully forecasted and tipped the champion.
3. A conservation week in Hong Kong Time is a contest period. Total Profit Rate = (Final Total Asset - Initial Total Asset)/Initial Total Asset
For example, contestant A’s account balance is 10000 DEW at 10:00 Jul 16, 2018 (Monday, HKT); and it increases to 19800 DEW at 23:59 Jul 22, 2018 (Sunday, HKT), then, for contestant A, Profit Rate = (19800-10000) /10000=98%.
 
【TIPPING RULES】
1. Each spectator can obtain a wallet address (QR code) on the tipping page. Copy the address and tip via it.
2. Login to your wallet account in DEW App, transfer 10x(an integer multiple of 10) DEW to the address for tipping(the one you copied).

5. Wallet account on DEW is the only medium of tip and receiving bonus. Addresses from other exchanges or third parties are not available for this event.

7. Times of tipping for champion refers to the quantity of lucky numbers generated by tipping the champion. Assuming that the champion received tips from 50 spectators, each spectator contributes 20 DEW, then, 100 lucky numbers will be generated, i.e. the champion gets 100 times  of tipping.

Remark:
1． MOD is a function to find the reminder. Its format is: MOD (nExp1,nExp2), i.e. the remainder obtained after dividing one numerical expressions into the other.

Minimum-guarantee bonus is equal to principal of tipping, and early bird bonus decreases progressively according to the sequence of tipping.

For example, spectator A tips contestant Zhang San 1 time (10DEW), and A is the first person tips Zhang San. There’s 100 lucky numbers generated from tipping Zhang San. If Zhang San does become champion, then, A gets minimum-guaranteed bonus: 10dew, early bird bonus: 2*10* (100-1+1) /100 = 20DEW, 30 DEW totally.

On top of that, anything tied to ID doesn't even seem reliable, so there goes that,",1531207101,10/07/2018 07:18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8xmkvd/how_to_buy_btc_with_no_id_verification_in/,1

Korean Blockchain Association crypto exchanges results due tomorrow,"Strap yourselves in because if it's good news all around, it'll be a fun .........

Industry insiders are paying particular attention to whether the results will lead to the issuance of new commercial bank accounts for the exchanges. Previously, the KBA stated that it was in talks with banks about issuing accounts only to the exchanges that meet the regulations.

“After conducting a self-regulatory review, we will help the self-regulated exchanges get new bank accounts,” said Chin Dae-je, president of the KBA.ride to the Moon

"Open source Online store that accepts BTC, No third party processor","We are a HK clothing company, that has not opened our online store yet, but have had such a headache banking in HK that I created this online store to gain a better understanding of BTC. The store is more for our educational purposes (and yours), but it does work and ship out products every day at 5pm.

Obviously wanted to spread the word, but there is defiantly a lack of information on how to commercially accept BTC. At the bottom I linked our source code. Should defiantly check it out if interested in coding.

“You use a third party BTC payment processor that is the lovechild of Coinbase and BTCPay resulting after a night of flirting over BCash, you fascist pigs!!!”

Only accept BTC, and doesn’t use a third party for payment processing.

The admin side of the site is basic but works, and is easy to navigate for users and coders. 

It shows all orders placed, orders you shipped, and allows you to create a product, and update stock.

Site uses Electrum to accept payments and create addresses.

Electrum can be set up to be process payments in a much more elegant way, as mentioned in it’s docs. And for larger operations I would recommend that.

However, I wanted to go with what I think is a simpler way, where the coder doesn’t need to know their way around a Linux, and a lower level web developer could get this working relatively quickly for prospective clients.

Feel free to copy pasta any code.

Learn how the institutional investors invest,"Hi All,

I've been in the cryptocurrency scene since early 2017 and I've always been trying to think of ideas that can grow and better the community in some way. I'm a recent graduate in Mathematics and Finance and i'm currently working at a mutual fund in quantitative research.

From this i've been slowly producing my own localhost website(website on my own computer) which allows me to apply quantitative measures and standard funds management techniques (listed below) learned in traditional finance to cryptocurrency. I'm thinking of putting a lot more effort into this project and launching it online.

The main idea is to have tutorials that help retail investors (me and you) apply these techniques which, in turn, produce a more robust portfolio creation and management processes. These types of techniques can help bridge the gap between institutional and retail investors and hopefully educate the community as a whole. Some features that the website would have:

1. Portfolio comparison  
   1. Compare and share ideas between user's portfolios
2. Performance Analysis
3. Attribution Analysis  
   1. compare your portfolio against the benchmark
4. Correlation Analysis
5. Risk Analysis  
   1. Value at risk
   2. Standard Deviation
   3. Scenario Testing

In conclusion, if you're interested in learning more about creating and managing a portfolio like institutional investors please leave a comment with any extra feedback about the idea.

p.s it will be free

"Second children's book about blockchain ""Blocky explains Blockchain"" released","Some background:

I wrote ""A Place in the Blockchain"" originally to introduce my three year old to some of the words and concepts of blockchain through a short cute story about a block finding it's place and then the process continuing in a loop.  I am pretty happy with the results already because we were watching a documentary that mentioned ""blockchain"" and she asked about ""Blocky"", the main character in the book.  

Now I have released a second book ""Blocky explains Blockchain"" which delves a bit deeper into the technology and explanations of what exactly occurred during the adventure. This could be seen as a level 2 of the process of introducing kids to blockchain in my vision. Mainly for parents who want to get their kids interested in technology in round about ways so that when this technology is mainstream they will have good memories about it, secondly because if I have to read bedtime stories its better if its something that I am interested in :). 

Disclaimer: your 3-5 year old kid will not be making pull requests to bitcoin core after this, if you want a comprehensive introduction to blockchain I would suggest Mastering Bitcoin or Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies. 

The ebook is free today on Amazon 07/10/2018:

Bustabit Script - Bustabit.com Script by Bitk0ynR2 - 7 BTC in 2 days!,"# BustaBit Script - BustaBit.com Script by Bitk0ynR2

Hello fellow Bitcoin gamblers! Today I will start selling my own (private) script for Bustabit.com
This script works on the new *Bustabit v2* (since Jan 2018). The site changed owners and modified its coding a bit.
This unique code has made me a staggering **7 BTC** in only 2 weeks.
Due to the fact that this script is very, very secure and the has the possibility to make you many BTCs over a few days, I won't be selling this script for cheap, the price is currently 1 BTC. I will accept BTC as payment method only, no altcoins.

## Can I trust your Bustabit.com Script?

YES, you can! You will a link to my personal account on the site below. I am using the exact same script as I am selling.
[https://www.bustabit.com/user/BitK0ynR2](https://www.bustabit.com/user/BitK0ynR2) and [https://www.bustadice.com/user/BitK0ynR2](https://www.bustadice.com/user/BitK0ynR2)  furthermore, you can always contact me on my email - bitk0ynr2 [at] gmail.com

**Bustabit** is one of the more original bitcoin betting sites you will come across in the online casino world. The domain isn’t quite an online casino, and it is more like a single game than anything else. Previously known as Moneypot, this challenging game has seen over 146 million bets placed, with over 420,000 bitcoins wagered, and has an maximum pay-out of 37.5 BTC. Betting limits in this game range from a low of 0.000001 BTC, up to 1BTC, and gameplay is only available in English, but is available to players based almost anywhere in the world. So, with the introduction out of the way, what can we tell you about the Bustabit game itself?

There is only one game to play at **Bustabit.com**. Players are basically wagering against a pot of money, used by the “system”. The basic idea is that you make a bet, and watch as multipliers rise high. Players can cash out on multipliers at any time, but if they do not do so before the game crashes, they will lose their bet. At least, that is the most simplistic way to explain it. It certainly seems logical enough, but how can that be profitable for Bustabit?

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/871437721360904192/1hkmyX45_400x400.jpg)

Their social gambling game features a multiplier which moves very quickly, and it drops as well as rises. Special bonuses can be dished out to players surviving long enough in the game, and cashing out immediately before the crash, so many players choose to stay in – eventually losing as the game crashes before they withdraw. **Bustabit** had a little problem in the past with proving that they were not fixing the system, but now a fair play certificate has been announced, proving that the game is legit, and fair on all.

Should the game crash at 0x, all bets will be refunded (there is only a 1% chance of this happening). It might seem simple, but this is actually a learning game, and there is a very complex formula behind it, so when you start playing it, if you are not careful and don’t do your homework, you can be behind rather quickly.

It is important to remember that this is a very small-scale game, so multipliers won’t make you a millionaire. The pot is privately funded by the game’s creator, but as more players decide to try their luck on this game, the pot size should increase in the future (via larger multipliers).

**Bustabit** only allows you to deposit using bitcoins. Generally speaking, one you have made a transaction to your Bustabit account, you should receive your in-game credits within 10 minutes. Players can withdraw bitcoins to any bitcoin address, and smaller transactions are processed instantly, whilst any larger ones could take up to 24 hours to be processed.

There is a 100 bits free for any withdrawal, although that works out at just $0.05 in total. All withdrawals must be made in increments of 1 bit (100 satoshis), and must be worth at least 200 bits.

There isn’t much in the way of customer support over at Bustabit. A very lengthy and extensive FAQ guide can tell you all you need to know about the game, but you won’t really be able to rely on any kind of customer services team to help you out. As we’ve said, this social gambling game is a one-man effort.

Considering that this is a solo-project, one has to be immensely impressed with the design of Bustabit. It isn’t an online casino, and the only game you can play is the titular one; but, if you are in the mood for something wholly new, and totally original, then spending your bitcoins on **Bustabit** could be an ideal afternoon for you.

How can I create an API on my own machine to exchange bitcoins.,"There are so many services and API's for getting payments in bitcoin. I'm not very familiar with bitcoin systems. But since it does not have a central system I can also start an API for myself and send and receive btc. Can you please guide me to correct path. At least my google searches for creating a bitcoin api did not really  helped me.

API Should be able to:

* Create a new wallet,
* Send money from account A to account B while charging a fee for my service.
* Confirm the money is sent.

At least in my mind these might be a possible solution.

1. Get a machine. ( Which OS would work the best. I'd prefer windows. )
2. Install bitcoin with a CLI ( What should I exactly install? ) 
3. Create a Web API and send commands via CLI. ",1531288259,11/07/2018 05:50:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8xx0zh/how_can_i_create_an_api_on_my_own_machine_to/,1

Using references in order to compress the byte size of transactions,"I was thinking of ways a blockchain's format might be designed so that its transaction records can be made more compact. One low hanging fruit appears the following..

Transaction inputs involve previous outputs on the chain. If in place of recording these subsequent inputs by value, they were instead only referenced in transaction records, then perhaps their byte size could be reduced significantly.

The idea would work something like this: whenever a new output is recorded on the chain, an unused  (monotonically increasing) numeric ID is recorded next to it so that subsequent blocks may reference that value by ID. Since the space of IDs so defined can probably fit in something like 8-10 bytes, it seems like a considerable savings.

Am I overlooking something? (Is/was this something already considered?)",1531289409,11/07/2018 06:10:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8xx4zf/using_references_in_order_to_compress_the_byte/,1

https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8xruqe/life_threatened_from_skycoin_maniac/,"Overview:  


 r/CryptoCurrency Mods are very corrupt  its almost sad.. Some guy made a post about someone ""threatening him"" and without any proof said it's someone connected to Skycoin. Now I don't have proof that it is or isn't related to Skycoin, but I do find it odd that the subreddit just allows these types of posts to happen on a regular basis (they would delete this post immediately because it doesn't fit their narrative) with no ground to them whatsoever. Below is some screens and logic along with the users twitter account to see how he generally communicates with people.

Logic:  


Can we all think with our brains for a second, how does this message  identify a Skycoin employee or member as the sender (in other words  where is his proof this is Skycoin related to be able to jump to his  conclusion in his title, for someone spouting PROVE IT he's certainly  not proving much and just FUDing). Looking at this guys past on Reddit  and Twitter he seems to burn bridges with a lot of people (seems like a  very angry individual). He also seems to be a NANO shill while calling  every persons coins shitcoins and generally speaking he's just an  asshole to everyone... This message could have been written by 20+  different people based on this guys comment history on multiple  different social platforms. Just pointing out what I see wrong with this  post and how this subreddit keeps this post alive with ZERO proof is  even more baffling to say the least.

Daily Market Recap - 07/11 - Can the BTC bulls defend the $6k support? Bitcoin brings carnage to altcoins markets,"*Processing img m1tiqa4nhb911...*

From $258.4 billion to $251.8 Billion. Almost $7 Billion has left the building and the crypto markets are in pain as total crypto market capitalization has fallen 4.5&amp;#37; on the day. Although volume has remained stable at $13 billion over the past 24 hours, all the coins from the top 10 coins by 24-hour volume posted a negative change, ranging from 1&amp;#37; to 8&amp;#37;.

Bitcoin (**BTC**) has lost 3.47&amp;#37; in the past 24 hours and further losses are looking to be the order of the day as it plummets below $6400 key support. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is at $6362. On the 1 hour chart, MACD is on the bullish side but there is very little volume currently. The Heikin Ashi are showing reverse candles and last candle is bullish. The green RSI is still pointing upwards and above 50 which can mean possible buyers. The yellow SRSI is pointed down below 80. The Money Flow Index is turning up.  


https://i.redd.it/rrbrc54thb911.png

Despite the carnage brought by Bitcoin, some analysts are predicting a possible reversal soon as the cryptocurrency is still holding well above the recent low of $5,755 (hit on June 24).

If the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern). However, the short duration charts indicate BTC will likely defend the support at $6000. The RSI is already reporting oversold conditions (below 30.00) and another 300 dollar drop would only make it hard for the bears to push BTC below $6000.  


So, what are your thoughts? Is it time for reversal or we feed the bears a little more?

Question about node syncing.,"I would like to put the blockchain data that I got one of my devices onto another machine and I was curious to ask if you set up bitcoin nodes (core) on the same network (my local network), will they just start syncing data to each other via the LAN?

Doesn't sound like too bad a way to pass it over, since the new machine will also want to verify the incoming blocks as well.",1531318357,11/07/2018 14:12:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8xzwzz/question_about_node_syncing/,1

Need help choosing a wallet/debit/exchange option,"As will soon be obvious, im new to bitcoin. I currently have a Coinbase account which I made primarily to be able to pay my kratom purchases because my vendor offered a rebate. Well I won't be doing that anymore and due to Coinbases long ass time frames for bank transfers and fees I'm not real impressed with them. What I'm desiring is a wallet that:
-allows me to quickly transfer funds from my bank account or debit
-possibly has a physical debit card to spend from
-possibly links to my PayPal and allows transferring funds to and from there
-also okay for letting a chunk of money sit and accrue value. 

I understand all of these things may not be achievable. I'd approciate any help getting in the rught direction, a whole lot! I have 80 bucks that took 9 days to transfer from my bank to coinbase that I rrally don't wanna wait another 5 to transfer back, that I need to place a order,with my new farmer via debit or PayPal. 😒 ",1531319178,11/07/2018 14:26:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8y00zo/need_help_choosing_a_walletdebitexchange_option/,1

How Bitcoin Can Be Used To Buy Coffee,"Bitcoin isn’t very scalable for something touted as the “future of currency.” For example, payment provider Visa processes 4,000 transactions per second and can scale up to 65,000 transactions per second. In comparison, Bitcoin can only handle about 7 transactions per second. This doesn’t even come close to what a currency should be able to process.

We can’t pay for a coffee and wait hours for the transaction to go through. Plus, every transaction on the blockchain entails a fee to the network. Since this fee is like a bid, transactions that are willing to pay high fees are processed first. The fees are high when the network is congested, which can sometimes result in a fee that’s higher than the payment itself.

This has been an issue the cryptocurrency community has been grappling years. Although, they recently devised a fix in the form of the Lightning Network.

Non-propagating dust transaction creation by pools needs to stop!,"This is an issue that has led to unnecessary clogging of the network for a long time, yet it seems to be one that has been overlooked for some time.

For those who don't know: BLOCK REWARD = 12.5BTC + (SUM OF ALL TRANSACTION FEES MINED ON THAT BLOCK)

Most of the largest pools keep the transaction fee part of the block reward for themselves (i.e. they do not pay that out to miners.)

Here's what I'm talking about:

This is done by pools that do not pay out transaction fees to  miners (Antpool is by far the worst offender.) The practice is only profitable to pools which retain the transaction fee part of the block reward for themselves. The pool constantly creates a large number of minable but non-propagating transactions by creating transactions which violate the network ""dust"" rule. This rule prevents payments of less than 0.00001BTC from being broadcast throughout the network. As a result the transaction gets ""stuck"" in the pool's node and as such can only be mined by them. They will attach a large fee to the transaction, which in turn lowers the priority of transactions with lower fees attached. This ensures that only transactions with the highest fees are included in the block they mine- leaving the transactions with lower fees attached unconfirmed, driving up the necessary transaction fee, wasting mining power mining transactions that server no other purpose other than to drive up transaction fees and allowing the pool to, in essence, refuse to mine transactions with a fee below a certain amount attached. Since the pool will mine it's own transactions, they can create a virtually unlimited number of these transactions, with many unconfirmed descendants, to serve their purpose depending on the state of the mempool, and since they do not pay out transaction fees to the miners, they will get back all the transaction fees they used to attach to these transactions. Algorithms determine how much of the block-space to ""waste"" in order to maximize the profit- since the mempool can be analyzed at any time, it can be determined exactly how many transactions to create and what fee to attach in order to mine the transactions with the highest fee attached and drive up the necessary fee to have a transaction confirmed along with the ""smart-fee,"" while ensuring low fee transactions are mined by the pools that do not practice this strategy. The strategy pays highest when the mempool is above 1MB (the size of a block) or has quickly filled. It also is most profitable when the fee distribution and queue-time in the mempool is highly divided/distributed- this strategy can prevent lower-fee transactions that have been waiting a long time to confirm from replacing new transactions that have a high fee attached on a block.

In Summary:

1. Pool creates many ""dust"" transactions and attaches a high fee to each.
2. Dust transactions (transactions below 0.00001BTC) do not broadcast, so the pool is guaranteed to mine its own transactions and re-collect the high fees they attached to the transaction.
3. Pool now only mines outside transactions with the highest fees (per kB) attached, leaving the low-fee transactions to be mined by pools which do not practice this while simultaneously driving up the fee necessary to have a transaction confirmed.

Example:

  [https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/c57ea54104bbf160bac88b65b2edf465c5f8ac9253c42e391100fc31b028d645](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/c57ea54104bbf160bac88b65b2edf465c5f8ac9253c42e391100fc31b028d645)

If you click on the address, you can see this exact transaction is repeated exactly every hour (which sends a fixed amount back to itself and an address that cannot be decoded, due to the nature of the transaction, being sent 0BTC- which is what makes this a dust transaction.) If you go back to the block this transaction was originally confirmed (mined) on (by Antpool) you will see tons of similar transactions. In fact, Antpool has hundreds, if not thousands, of addresses used solely for this purpose. The practice is much more calculated and complex (in actual practice) than I summarized above. Eventually (or sometimes even on the same block) the divided outputs created by each transaction you see on that account would/will be concatenated into a single output over an additional series of combining, non-broadcasting, ""dust"" transactions.

Can it technically be considered a fair practice?

While their are plenty of valid reasons to create non-propagating transactions, such as to concatenate inputs left with dust amounts of bitcoin after valid transactions, without risking loosing the entire amount due to the minimum transaction fee being larger than the total amount, creating transactions like this with no other purpose than to increase a pools own profits is hard to argue as being a honorable one. Furthermore, since this practice is overall detrimental to the network (filling blocks with loads of unnecessary transactions, slowing confirmation times and artificially manipulating the necessary transaction fees) and in addition penalizes pools which pay the transaction fee part of the block reward to miners (since the practice cannot be performed by such pools, as it would cost the pool far too much,) as well as the fact that THE MINERS- THE ONES ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING THE MINING POWER ARE NOT BENEFITING, I think it is safe to say that this practice is a deplorable one. Yes, one could argue that this is a loophole and exploiting it is going to be a natural occurrence, but I believe that since it encourages pools not to pay the transaction fee part of the block reward to miners, it is a practice that should not continue.

What to do about it?

There are a few options:

You can try if you run a full-node, but...: I for instance run a full node on a high bandwidth, fixed IP and allow incoming connections. I allow more connections in the command line options and maintain a few hundred connections at once. I noticed a few pools started automatically connecting to my node (I had to do some nmap scanning and some other testing to confirm they were indeed pool nodes, and who they belonged to, but was able to determine that- my first clue was multiple connections from bitcoinj nodes in the same subnet.) I was also able to find the addresses of other pool nodes and manually add them with the \`addnode' command. So, with multiple pools connected (or the ability to connect to multiple pools upon restart,) I tweaked my node to allow for the broadcast of both zero-fee and dust transactions. My thinking was that I could serve as an unknowing ""bridge"" between pools- broadcasting one pools ""dust"" transactions to another, thereby removing the pool's ability to ensure that the transaction was not mined by another pool and making the practice unprofitable.

BUT... While this sounds good in theory, in practice it doesn't work for a few reasons. First of all, the pool nodes would not connect to me once I started broadcasting dust transactions. Second, I noticed my overall connection count way down, leading me to believe that broadcasting dust transactions was causing me to be labeled as a misbehaving node and finally, while this could work for some less advanced pools, Antpool, at least, designs its dust transactions in such a way that they violate more than just the ""dust"" rule- further tweaking would be required and this would need to be an action taken by a majority of nodes to work.

The only other option, I suppose,  would be to appeal to the bitcoin dev team. Perhaps they could implement a way to prevent this practice, although I do not likely see it happening. The ""dust"" rule is in place to prevent clogging of the network with tiny transactions- to prevent anyone wishing to back-up the network from being able to do so without spending a large sum of money. The dust rule and the minimum transaction fee go hand in hand to prevent such occurrence- so anyone wishing to do harm to the network would soon find themselves spending very large amounts of BTC in an attempt to back it up- pools which retain the transaction fee however are not bound by these limitations.

The only real option to fight this, as a miner, is to mine on a pool that pays the transaction fee part of the block reward to the miners- you'll make more anyway, even if the overall fee may be slightly higher. An example of one of these pools is KANO, there are many others. I would just avoid antpool in general- but that's just me.

tl;dr

Pools which retain the transaction fee part of the block reward use a loophole is a network rule that allows them to only mine high fee transactions, which in turn hurts pools that pay the transaction fee part of the block reward to miners, clogs up the network- slowing confirmation times, and drives up transaction fees.",1531336283,11/07/2018 19:11:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8y2h4d/nonpropagating_dust_transaction_creation_by_pools/,1

It's time to implement sub-Satoshi fee (per byte) and let the fee market develop downwards.,"In late 2017 we all saw what happens when the blocks become full and the fee market is driven upwards. Thanks to segwit and transaction batching (as well as reduced no. of transactions) the transaction fee (in sat/byte) has been lower than ever. 

https://i.redd.it/f9ywyt07ye911.png

But the cost in $/transaction (arguably a more important metric) is significantly higher than it was in the earlier years of bitcoin. While blocks remain not full, transactions can be cheaper. This is important to allow bitcoin to be used in very low income countries where even a few cents are still too much. This will also help displace many altcoins who's major claim is 'lower fees than bitcoin'. 

Over the last 2 weeks sub-satoshi fees have started building up in the mempool (see below). These are not clearing despite having non-full blocks because the current relay rules do not allow these transactions to be included. 

https://i.redd.it/vnknq4kfxe911.jpg

No hardfork or softfork is needed to implement this change as long as the total transaction fee is more than 1 satoshi. This is more a matter of getting mining and wallet protocols to start allow these transactions.

My Story With A Smug Bubble Caller,"When bitcoin was \~300, he said it'll never work, it's going to 0. 

When bitcoin hit 1k, he said it'll happen exactly like it did in 2014 and it'll go back down to the hundreds.

When bitcoin hit 2-4k, he said it was ""overvalued"" and the bubble was going to burst.

When bitcoin hit 10k+, he was starting to doubt himself. You had to look into his eyes. It consumed him. It ate him up from the inside. He just kept saying over and over again, that the bubble was going to burst. 

Now that bitcoin is \~6k. He's ecstatic. I've never seen him this happy. He's probably feeling like a genius and telling anyone who would listen, ""I told you so :)"". 

I suppose in the end he was ""right"". ",1531369381,12/07/2018 04:23:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8y6m7n/my_story_with_a_smug_bubble_caller/,1

Please give some suggestion ^^,"  The crypto currencies are so dangerous, I have no idea where to go.  Last time, I heard some cryptocurrency called USC.  And someone told me more about it. The mechanism of issuing USC is: Once 1 USC is issued, It will save 1 US dolar to reserve account in the bank. Once 1USC is withdrawen by a holder, 1 USC will be burnt. The infomation of USC reserve account will be transparent for the public, in addition, the account will be under a third-party supervision. Every user have right to know about the volume of issued USC and the balance in USC reserve account.  

I mean is it reliable?  can someone give some idea.  Thanks. \^ \^ ",1531389496,12/07/2018 09:58:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8y8dfd/please_give_some_suggestion/,1

Feedback on accepting Bitcoin for Beef Jerky via coinbase commerce,"Hi Everyone,

I just wanted to give a bit of feedback to my fellow reditors about how my use of Bitcoin has been since integrating it to my website for my beef jerky company Tong Jerky.

Coinbase commerce works very smoothly for the most part, especially the check out. The only down side is that it is hard to withdraw funds in to fiat at the moment but I believe they are working on that, also its a good time to HODL so im not looking to withdraw anytime soon.

I was wondering what other peoples experiences were with coinbase commerce. Thanks

Also for those interested the website is www.tongjerky.com

Lighting Network vs Zero Confirmation Transactions,"I wonder what are the pros and cons of both approaches according to the Bitcoin community. Just asked a fair question to Bitcoin Cash community how they would address the slow time to get the first confirmation and they pointed out at ZCT. Idea is certainly not bad, I have some concerns though. I mean yeah, credit cards sort of started doing this at some point (stop asking you to sign after paying with CC) but if you commit fraud with the CC there is an attached name to it. With crypto it is not hard to hide the name and if you figure it out how to commit thousands of double spends it might be a big problem.  


Apart from that I cannot see on chain scaling going to 10000 tx/s second (which I believe is required to go against Visa or Paypal). IMO the blockchain growth might greatly exceed Moore's law. E.g. at 10k tx/s in my rough math says 100P blockchain in a year with that TX rate (correct me if I am wrong please). 

There is the problem with decentralization but let's leave that for a moment and look at the speed metrics alone.  


So my question really is what do you guys think about the scaling/speed enhancement solutions in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?   


P.S. Hope this is took as a tech question and not as BTC/BCH war debate one. I am most certainly not a proponent of BCH.

Daily Market Recap - 07/12 - Will we go below $5800?,"Bitcoin (BTC) is a train wreck and taking everything in its path. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is sitting at $6200, losing -2.86&amp;#37; in the last 24 hours. Volume is at $3.6 B. Losses are accelerating towards the next supports at $6100 and $6050.

On the 4 hour chart, MACD is heavily bearish. The yellow SRSI is nearing oversold below 40. The RSI is on the oversold levels but still pointing down. Money Flow Index is pointed upwards. Sellers seems to be hitting the panic button and there are no buyers in sight. The only good thing (as for now) seems to be that so far, it’s still holding up above $5755 low (hit on June 24).

The last defense is at $6000 and the RSI is already reporting oversold conditions (below 30.00) and if the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern).

Allthough, the low volume and lack of demand from bulls have reduced the probability of a corrective rally occurring in the next 24 to 48 hours. If Bitcoin can recover back to $6,300 and stabilize in that region, it could eye a move towards $6,400. However, if BTC fails to find any momentum at this price range, a further drop is inevitable.

When using a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S, it seemingly compiles all of my UTXOs and gives me one single amount representation.

CoinTools: a set of command-line tools and Ruby libs for checking cryptocurrency prices on CoinMarketCap etc.,"Link: [https://github.com/mackuba/cointools](https://github.com/mackuba/cointools)

I've been building some tools for myself since January to automate some work around crypto trading. One thing I needed was a way to quickly check the price of a given coin right now or in the past (""what was the price of BTC on Kraken last Monday when I made that purchase/sale?""), either manually when I'm updating some spreadsheets, or as a part of some larger script. Previously I'd usually do this manually, opening CoinMarketCap/Bitcoinity/Cryptowatch, finding the right date and reading the value from the chart, but it was pointless work that added up to quite a lot of time, so it seemed like a perfect thing to automate by connecting to these sites' APIs. (Of course it kind went like this: [https://www.xkcd.com/1319/](https://www.xkcd.com/1319/) since I probably spent way more time building this than I saved...)

So far I've added support for 3 price APIs: CMC, [Cryptowat.ch](https://Cryptowat.ch) and [CoinCap.io](https://CoinCap.io), and I'm not really planning to add any more at this point since this covers everything I need: CMC lists every coin possible, [Cryptowat.ch](https://Cryptowat.ch) has past prices for most major coins on major exchanges with pretty good precision, and [CoinCap.io](https://CoinCap.io) has past prices for more coins but with worse precision.

All 3 can be used in two ways:

1) From the command line:

    &gt; cmcap bitcoin
    bitcoin @ 2018-07-12 16:52:37 +0200 ==&gt; 6201.51 USD

You can add `-q` to get just the value, if you want to pass it further to other commands:

    &gt; cmcap bitcoin -q | sed -e 's/\./,/' &gt;&gt; stats.csv

For Cryptowatch and CoinCap you can also check historical prices (the precision usually decreases the further you go in the past, but it should usually be good enough):

    &gt; cryptowatch kraken btceur ""2017-12-27 9:30""
    kraken:btceur @ 2017-12-27 09:00:00 +0100 ==&gt; 13562.4 EUR

CoinMarketCap doesn't currently have a public API that lets you check prices in the past.

2) If you know Ruby, you can make all the same calls from code, and some more - e.g. for CMC there's a method to download all coins on the site sorted by rank.

    require 'cointools'
    
    cw = CoinTools::Cryptowatch.new
    result = cw.get_price('kraken', 'btceur', Time.new(2017, 12, 1))
    puts result.price
    
    cmc = CoinTools::CoinMarketCap.new
    cmc.get_all_prices.first(10).each { |c| p [c.symbol, c.usd_price] }

Hopefully someone will find these tools useful :)",1531408833,12/07/2018 15:20:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8yaoef/cointools_a_set_of_commandline_tools_and_ruby/,1

"Bitcoin is going up,Again.","After topping at near $20,000 in mid-December, the world's leading cryptocurrency by market cap has been in nothing but freefall ever since. But over the last week, Bitcoin has moved closer to $10,000, cracking $9,000 in mid-morning trading on Tuesday. What's happening with this crazy coin now? The quick answer: big investors and tech upgrades.

""Bitcoin is trading upwards for a number of reasons,"" says Fran Strajnar, CEO of Brave New Coin, a data and research company focused on the blockchain and cryptographic assets market. Strajnar thinks the fundamentals of Bitcoin have improved. Recent improvements to its lightning network and outside forces from regulators are both bringing investors back. ""The U.S. is stepping in to regulate security tokens instead of commodity assets (utility) and we are seeing major value investors stepping into buy as a result,"" he says. Security tokens are cryptocurrencies issued by startups similar to shares, while utility tokens are like coupons used for a specific service the issuer offers. Both are tradable on an exchange.

And a new method to earn more with bitcoins ([this one](https://wikandor.wordpress.com/2018/07/10/make-huge-amounts-of-money-really-simply-with-bitcoin-in-2018/)) came out,making new millionaires everyday.

""Word is getting out that traditional financial industry players are preparing to enter the crypto trading markets soon,"" says Eiland Glover, CEO of Kowala, a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency.

Goldman Sachs reportedly hired crypto trader Justin Schmidt.

Barclays is considering a crypto trading desk.

DECoin (Decentralized Economy Coin),"Democratic Economy Coin (DEC)

Cryptocurrencies have given a great step in the development of money. Bitcoin (the most dominant of them) has many advantages that show us solutions to common problems. Some of the advantages are:

• Decentralization

• Transparency

• Global and inclusive economy

• Real-time transactions

• Non-fiat

• Unforgeable

• Payment fraud protection: transactions cannot be reversed

• Reduced possibility of identity theft

• Continuous operation system

• Low transaction costs

• Safer transactions than those backed by banks

• Exclusion of third parties

• Financial privacy

• Emission limit

• Divisible currency

• Micro-payments

• Small space usage

• Etc.

One of the main problems of fiat money that is not adequately addressed by current cryptocurrencies is the distribution inequality. The present technology already allows a financial ecosystem in which its participants can regulate the distribution of wealth and this is why I want to share this idea of ​​a currency that allows a democratic economy: DECoin

The DECoin protocol is based on the idea of ​​bitcoin except for some fundamental differences:

1) The amount of DECoins is fixed and created 100&amp;#37; from the beginning. The fixed amount will be equal to 7.6E12. This number could be another, I simply chose this so that the average amount of coins per person in the world (7.6 billion people) is approximately 1000.

2) Each person would be allowed to have one (and only one) wallet. This can be achieved using:

a) Frequency of heartbeat as ""Trove"" (https://www.designOWom.com/design/benjamin-hubert-secure-wearable-cryptocurrency-wallet-06-05-2018/)

b) Digital recognition of fingerprints

c) Facial recognition

d) Iris recognition

e) Password (for a maximum period of time, in case the person forgets it)

f) Etc ...

3) An operational wallet (OW) is a wallet that has been used (to receive or send DECoins) in less than 365 days. An OW transforms into frozen wallet (FW) when it is 365 or more days in disuse

4) Each OW must vote (the votes can be changed any time) on ​​essential issues of this new economy:

a) The maximum number of times that the richest OW can have the average (average wealth = 7.6E12 / number of OWs) of DECoins in the system

Each participant can vote freely on the maximum wealth of DECoins that can be in a OW. The median obtained by all votes (of all OWs) of this indicator in the system will be publicly displayed and may change constantly according to the preferences of the participants.

b) The preferred percentage for mining. In this system, only the owners of OWs with the lowest balance have a preference to be miners (register transactions and get rewarded for it)

In Bitcoin or other dominant systems, anyone can mine. The problem is that for mining to be profitable, you have to own huge mining farms and buy expensive equipment (large initial investment) or have access to very cheap electricity, which varies depending on the location (not everyone has the same opportunities to be a miner). For people with fewer resources, starting to mine and rent from this, is practically impossible.

In DECoin, the wallets will be constantly ranked by balance and ONLY the owners of the preferred &amp;#37; of OWs with the lowest balance will have access to mine. The miners will provide processing capacity to record and encrypt network transactions in the block chain in exchange for rewards in DECoins. These rewards will come mainly from:

i) ""Frozen"" DECoins: DECoins trapped in the block chain in FWs: DECoins are not lost

ii) OWs with excesses: DECoins that exceed the established maximum number of times the average (number democratically chosen by the users)

If there is a ""tie"" in terms of OWs selected for mining, factors such as location, wallet age, experience (times that has been miner), etc. will be prioritized.

In case the network of miners is insufficient, the selected percentage increases gradually until satisfying the mining fluidity of the ecosystem.

5) The time frame of the duration of the decisions and the anticipation for the execution of them:

For example; if 30&amp;#37; of the mining percentage is obtained at a specific instant, this vote will indicate when this measure will take place (instantaneously, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months after the decision) and for how long that 30&amp;#37; will last.

6) Wallets can be anonymous or open (useful for public service jobs) depending on the decision of the owner

7) New users would automatically have the preference to be miners: inclusive system unlike Bitcoin or other large ones in which the wealth distribution horrible 

8) DECoin exchanges will be purely P2P without intermediaries because only personal wallets are allowed

I await your comments, opinions, questions. 😊

Hopefully, together we can create a currency in which the users control their distribution

Most environmental way to invest in Bitcoin and Altcoins...,"The most honest, fair, and kind way to invest in any Crypto you're still unsure of is to ""buy your weight"" worth...

What I mean is buy 0.002 Bitcoin per month/year, because 21 million (total BTC) divided by 7 billion (total population) equals approximately 0.0027 ie. Your fair human weight...

If a coin has 1 billion total supply, buy 0.13 coins for your fair weight.

100 billion = 135.0 coins for your fair weight.

Here's why Bitcoin will win the war,"The SDR is neither a currency, nor a claim on the IMF. Rather, it is a  potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members. Holders  of SDRs can obtain these currencies in exchange for their SDRs in two  ways: first, through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between  members; and second, by the IMF designating members with strong external  positions to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions. 

In addition to its role as a supplementary reserve asset, the  SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF and some other  international organizations. It is also used in the IMF’s financing  arrangements with its member countries.

Selling Bitcoin for cash in person.,"So I am in the UK and I want to sell as much as 2 BTC over the next 6 months for cash. I am looking at the traders on local bitcoin and wondering who I can trust.

I would like to hear from anyone with this experience and some advise, in particular.
Why a lot of traders are offering a lot more than the going rate, are they scammers?
All traders seem to say that I need to move the funds first, could anyone tell me what stops the buyer just walking away once I have transferred Bitcoin to him/her and not giving me money?
I'm thinking of doing the transfers a little bit at a time until I can trust a trader. I can do trades in London and Birmingham areas.

Let's discuss LoL,"From this week news, we find the world is focusing on the security of crypto currency and block chain. On July 10, President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday creating a task force that will focus in part on developing guidance for crypto currency fraud investigations.. The security of block chain and crypto currencies has always been a core issue that plagues all countries and is the focus of all. Maybe it is so far for us, IT, finance, policy… 

Let’s discuss what we familiar with, Crypto markets continue to see red today, July 12, as data from Coin360 shows, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below the $6,200 price point. All of the top 50 coins by market cap are red on the day to press time. When the market is repeatedly fluctuating, the function of our USC is standing out.. USC is the crypto currency that will give you the time for thinking, unless the US dollar disappears on the earth.. You can convert USC to dollar with 1:1 ratio whenever you want to. For example, you can maintain your value after you earn the money and then decide on ‘go big or go home’. And it will issue USC by the end of this month.

How Bitcoin can create political disagreements and disrupt centralized governments from inside?,"Despite the loudly expressed opposition to Bitcoin, many traditionally over-centralized governments have inadvertently revealed sighs of hidden political disagreements and even struggles on the issue of Bitcoin. It might be either the sign of growing Bitcoin popularity within the government bureaucracy or, instead, an indication of upcoming anti-Bitcoin repressions. Here's an example of  the State of Kuwait.

Kuwait, with its one of the highest concentrations of wealth and power in the Middle East, is an important spot on the World's Bitcoin map. According to some estimates, which are dated back to November 2017, local population is responsible for 1.5% of Bitcoin global turnover.

At the same time, Kuwaiti major financial and economic authorities, such as Kuwait's Ministry of Finance (KMF), the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) and Kuwait's Commerce and Industry Ministry (KCIM) have apparently not reached the state of unanimity among themselves on the question of Bitcoin's future in the country.

On the one hand, KMF, which has repeatedly reiterated its negative stance on Bitcoin, announced, in December 2017, that local banks and other financial organizations are not allowed to trade on Bitcoin market. In its hawkish position KMF is alienated with Kuwaiti Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, which, in January 2018, issued a fatwa against Bitcoin trading, declaring it ""unclear"".

On the other hand, CBK still keeps its silence on this issue. Moreover, at the beginning of 2018, the fact that CBK together with KCIM intend ""to study the implication of Bitcoin"" in Kuwait was made public. This apparent discrepancy of opinions in the ranks of Kuwaiti officials might be explained by the growing disparity between a long-standing commitment of Kuwaiti government to its E-Government program and the rising frustration among local officials with the quickly multiplying challenges, which new, digitalized world poses to the country's traditional social and political institutions.

This E-Government program, stimulating citizen's engagement with the XXI century information economy, also includes a number of specific legal amendments, which, among other things, have opened to Kuwaitis an access to the on-line trading tools. That led to the commentary, issued by the Kuwaiti prosecution office in December 2017, which pointedly states that Bitcoin Internet trading is allowed in the country, because it falls under the auspices of the above-mentioned program.

Overall, all of those contradictory official policies, opinions and statements have created a climate of uncertainty and doubts concerning the present as well as the future of the Bitcoin in Kuwait.

"Discer412 asks, ""What's wrong with SHA-256 and how will changing the PoW fix the problem?""","There are two (but it's ultimately the same) problems with SHA-256, there are other problems with understanding 51% attacks, and how they work, I'll explain each issue briefly.

First, with 51% attacks and how they work. The MAIN concern with a 51% attack is the ""Rewind Attack"". This is where someone pays money to rent miners to ""Rewind"" the Bitcoin blockchain. The current cost to ""Rewind"" Bitcoin 1 Block is 12.5 BTC x Price (say $6,000) = $75,000. To make this profitable, you must transact, get the goods, and then rewind Bitcoin to get the coins back and have this new chain become accepted. Generally people would use an exchange, as crypto to crypto are the fastest 'exchanged' goods (as opposed to buying a car), and you might need to Rewind 18 blocks (3 hours) in order to clear the exchange without their fraud stuff going off. So the cost to Rewind BTC 18 blocks is currently $1.4 Mil, if you assume ""free market"", etc, etc. This is why PoW payouts are so high, and people brag about excessive hash power, but I suspect this can be solved by using a Check Point system (already in the code), that simply stops Nodes from accepting blockchains more than 6 blocks ""out of sync"". Currently Bitcoin is set to refuse blockchains that are 72 blocks (12 hours) out of sync, if I understand the code correctly. That's unnecessarily long, for it's current usage. But that is why people obsess over tons of hash power, but it's not really necessary (IMO). ""Rewind Attack"" is the primary form of a disruptive, and profitable, 51% attack.

Now, just to note, if one person already owns 51% of the miners (or so), then they can effectively do this anytime they want, but let's ignore that for now.

Problems with SHA-256 :

1) Hacking the SHA-256 algorithm. Long ago, some began hacking the SHA-256 algorithm. Originally, the Satoshi Nakamoto group had 3 basic concepts they were trying to promote 1) (Relative) Equality of Wealth Distribution, 2) Provide a market for advanced personal computing hardware, and 3) Provide a market for advanced power making hardware. Addressing points 2 &amp; 3, SHA-256 is not all purpose personal computing hardware, thus it provides no usefulness to the overall economy, and in fact is a drain of resources which could be better spent. Likewise, the hack was so powerful, that it made competition for power innovation (virtually) obsolete. Sure, huge warehouses, but had Bitcoin functioned as the Satoshi Nakamoto group originally intended, where personal computers were mining Bitcoin, then instead of warehouses attempting to move to power plants, you'd have say millions of homeowners installing water turbines, solar, and other devices in attempts to collect power, as this would become the scarce resource, not the hack.

2) Address point 1, ending the (relative) distribution of wealth equality. While some don't understand this concept concerning Byzantine consensus (including Nick Szabo, one of the smartest humans currently living), their is an issue of ""at stake"" or ""skin in the game"" that is necessary to maintain Byzantine consensus. If one person risks 99% of their wealth, and another risks 1%, then Byzantine consensus can fail as the person risking 1% is unmotivated to seek the truth. In the classic problem, two generals are risking death. But in Bitcoin, effectively Jihan risks 90% of his wealth, and maybe the collective of everyone else amounts to 10%. Which is to say the Future Bonuses of Bitcoin (which amount to around $20 Billion over the next few years) will go 90% to Jihan and maybe 10% to the rest of the world. This causes the world to become divested in protecting the validity of Bitcoin. You'd be amazed at how more educated, involved, and excited the overall community was when everyone was running an at home miner. Bitcoin was economic freedom. Today, it's Jihan's money pit.

And to clarify, as some do not understand the nature of a monopoly (and are loud, obnoxious, and really stupid), let me go over that for them, as I know those types of people frequent this forum and are not moderated against, if not encouraged.

In a monopoly, you set the price equal to the maximum. There is no ""supply demand"" really. It's simply, what is the maximum output X product can produce, and that will be my price. So in the case of Jihan Wu and Bitcoin, it's quite simple to calculate X Miner can produce $2,000 of expected wealth over it's life (again, about 1 year, and then it becomes industrial waste, wasted human energy and unnecessary pollution). The cost to produce said miner might be about $500, but this doesn't even matter.

So the selling price of the miner is say, $1,900, with an expected profit of $100 to the buyer, or 5%. Jihan immediately earns $1,400 in profits. This is not because his product is invaluable (in the traditional sense, like the Tesla Electric Motor), but because he created the best hack of the Bitcoin algorithm which effectively pays out in cash. So while Jihan may only mine with 50% of the Bitcoin hash, he receives 90% of the overall profits, as he is profiting $1,500 for each miner he uses himself, and $1,400 for each miner he sells, and the public profits $100 for each miner they purchase.

Now, this all gets complicated when you start to understand how Tera hashing works, production lead times, etc, etc. His profits often escalate well beyond expectation because (as a monopoly) his customers must pay for 1 month of development before a shipment (not sold in stores), he has worn their equipment without compensation (shipping used products), but most importantly he controls the Bitcoin payout.

In the payout calculation, one (may) assume linear growth in hash rate. However, after a Bitmain shipment the hash rate can double, effectively dropping profit expectations in half. And if you follow the Bitcoin hash rate, I think it increased 5x January to February, effectively dropping profit expectations to 20% of original projections. This is more problematic as persons pay 1 month in advance, unable to react to Bitmain swarm of production, as they could in a free market.

---

Long term, any PoW algo can become monopolized. But for now, Jihan has become an extreme monopolist and has been tolerated for years, with personal profits from Bitcoin exceeding several Billion. That's $$$$ Billions, from exploiting his hack, and state power. Switching PoW is a no brainer, and is what the original Satoshi Nakamoto group would have wanted but perhaps the persons who best understood these concepts is no longer participating in Bitcoin, and the remainders do not care.

But I think a Check Point system is the best approach, and significantly reducing the Bitcoin Bonus, down from 12.5 BTC per block to 0.05 BTC per Block. Doing this solves multiple issues simultaneously, 1) Makes it more valuable (scarce), 2) Reduces Monopolist Extortion (under any PoW system), and 3) Makes the Bonus equal to expected Transaction Fees, significantly reducing the effectiveness of ""transaction spam attacks"".

But all good things come to those who wait.",1531484979,13/07/2018 12:29:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8yjjvb/discer412_asks_whats_wrong_with_sha256_and_how/,1

Daily Market Recap - 07/13 - Crypto Market on Correction?,"  
 The market capitalization is slowly climbing up and hoping to enter $250 Billion today. After hitting a weekly low of $242 Billion markets have clawed back a little but are still very bearish. 

[https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/bitcoins-and-u-s-dollar-bills-730547\/](https://i.redd.it/nxu010v92q911.jpg)

The Bitcoin (BTC) price made it to as low as $6100 before recovering at the $6200 level, back to its price at this same time yesterday. It traded as low as $6076 before starting an upside correction. There was a decent comeback since the price moved above the $6220 level. It is currently struggling and may continue this trend against the USDT, facing hurdles near $6360 and $6420.

It is currently trading near the $6250 level and is consolidating above $6,200. It seems like the price may perhaps make another attempt to break the $6360 resistance. If it succeeds, there could be more gains above the $6420 resistance in the near term.

Looking at the chart, the 4 hour MACD is slowly moving in the bullish zone. The green RSI is hovering and undecided below 50. The yellow Stochastic RSI is overbought and the Money Flow Index is following RSI indecision. The Heikin Ashi Candles are showing good signals.

BIP32 question,"Hello everyone,

I am trying to wrap my head around BIP32, and need some confirmation about a few details.  
   
I think I have understood that on a very basic level, a *child\_private\_key* is the *parent\_private\_key* \+ an offset of *i* (index) + some added entropy called ""chain code"".

It is my understanding that starting from a master key, + 256 bits of *chain code*, + an index number (32 bits) we derive a child chaincode, and a child public key. And that these could go on and create further generations of public keys.

my questions are:  


1) By knowing a user's public key, and chain code, can I create public keys that will work for him, using **any** index number as long as it is 32 bits?

  
2) By knowing a child\_public\_key and the index number used to generate it, is it possible to find out the parent\_public\_key?  


3) By knowing the index numbers used to generate multiple child\_public\_keys, can I correlate them to one single parent\_public\_key ?   
3) By knowing the child\_public\_key, as well as the index number and chain\_code used to generate it, is it possible to find out the parent\_public\_key?

Thanks to anyone who will take the time :-)",1531492975,13/07/2018 14:42:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ykjbu/bip32_question/,1

Bitcoin is here to stay.,"Bitcoin (BTC) has always stood out as the one truly decentralized cryptocurrency that is globally accepted and recognized as such. The same cannot be said about most cryptocurrency projects. For instance, a ‘decentralized platform’ like Bancor was recently hacked for millions because it had a centralized switch giving the owner (project cofounder/administrator) special privileges. The hackers exploited those privileges of the ‘decentralized platform’ and got away with millions! This is why Bitcoin (BTC) is the largest cryptocurrency out there and will continue to be indefinitely. There will continue to be a huge rush till the number of BItcoin (BTC) remains below the total supply and its market cap remains below multiple trillions of dollars. A large chunk of the whole forex economy will have to absorb into Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as people lose faith in governments and financial institutions.

The sole reason people put their money and faith in Bitcoin (BTC) was because they were fed up off centralized currency. They did not like hoarding a piece of paper that would lose its value with every passing day. Furthermore, they did not want anyone telling them what they can or cannot do with their money. If a centralized body like Ripple or even Ethereum controls your money, they can decide to block your transactions or deny you service for whatever reason. Besides, there is a lack of trust in centralized cryptocurrencies to be used a mode of payment or store of value.

Institutional investors are not entering the cryptocurrency game just because they think they can get incredible returns on their investment. Of course, that is a big part of it as Wall Street has historically been motivated by greed. The primary reason institutional investors are getting into this game is because they now know without any doubt that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is the future. So, where does this leave Bitcoin (BTC)? Why should the number one digital currency in the world be Ripple (XRP) or Ethereum (ETH) or a cryptocurrency issued by the Federal Reserve?",1531495961,13/07/2018 15:32:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ykxtz/bitcoin_is_here_to_stay/,1

New Bitcoin ETF application sent to SEC,"Bitcoin  ETFs have been proposed before, not least by the Facebook twins, Gemini  exchange founders the Winklevoss brothers. In the past, the Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US body responsible for regulating  the securities markets, has denied permission for bitcoin ETFs. In March  2017, when the Winklevoss COIN ETF was denied, markets flash-crashed  from $1,350 down to $980 in just seconds, before recovering. (The news  did not halt the stellar bull run.)

The SEC’s reasons for  denying that ETF were as follows: ‘First, the exchange must have  surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the  underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second,  those markets must be regulated.’ Since bitcoin’s chief markets were  opaque and unregulated, there was scope for the ETF to be used in the  course of money laundering, terrorist financing and so on.

In December 2017,  Cboe — the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the world’s largest futures  exchange — were allowed to introduce bitcoin futures after failing in  their own ETF bids. These futures enabled ordinary retail traders to bet  against bitcoin. (They were controversial, and some critics have blamed  them for the dramatic fall in the price of BTC, which topped out the  same day they were launched.) This represented another step along the  way to mainstreaming bitcoin. However, futures are merely paper  contracts; no bitcoins are bought or sold in the course of their use.

Cboe has now filed for a  Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. This would enable regular investors to buy  and sell real bitcoin without having to manage a wallet or register with  a crypto exchange. The Cboe’s filing stated that they would only  buy/sell BTC on behalf of investors. The fund would trade bitcoin using  the OTC markets, without leverage. Buying bitcoin OTC makes it a lot  easier to trace, especially if you’re working directly with miners.  Funds will also be insured against hacking and theft.

The consensus is that  this ETF — Cboe’s third attempt — might actually have a shot at  approval. The landscape is very different to even a year ago, with  clearer regulatory frameworks and other jurisdictions, notably Japan,  leading the way in crypto adoption. If the US doesn’t approve an ETF,  someone else will soon enough. America risks being left behind if it  doesn’t start taking a more pro-active approach.

If the ETF passes, it  will launch in the first quarter of 2019. That could place significant  real demand on the market from retail investors, which could lead to  impressive fireworks. Stay tuned.

"New to Bitcoin, but serious question...","Hi everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read.

Okay, so even though I'm not an expert on Bitcoin, I'm making periodic purchases, because based on the limited knowledge/speculation I have on the economy I believe it will eventually become a major currency in our country - possibly the world. Perhaps this is doomsday-type thinking and maybe I don't know sh\*t about sh\*t, but hear me out...

My question is, what would happen to U.S. debt if we abandoned fiat money? Would it disappear? Also would everyone start from zero - with no debt, but poor - unless you are accumulating BTC already?

Again, this might be a dumb question, but I'm trying to understand cryptocurrency (and its relationship to economic collapse) better and if someone explained this concept to me that would be greatly appreciated.",1531497761,13/07/2018 16:02:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8yl72s/new_to_bitcoin_but_serious_question/,1

Help me to get this job!,"Hello guys, 

today i had a job interview from a Crypto currencies Company and they gave three small questions/tasks to research and answer. I am allowed to use the internet so here i am in Reddit asking you guys for opinions:

The questions are:

1. Imagine that you have an internet website that offers free Bitcoins. A visitor will earn Bitcoins after completing different tasks. Think in 5 different tasks you should ask for.

2. Name 10 different places in your city (Cologne / Germany - Köln) where you can pay tips in bitcion.

3. Imagine that you have a company where you pay your emplyees in Bitcoin. Describe the method you should follow to pay your employees.

So my thoughts are:

\- The first question is a bit confusing. What kind of tasks should i ask for? AM i supposed to a faucet site? or build a site based on that?

\- The second question might be tricky. They are NOT asking for places where you are allowed to pay in bitcoin, rather places where you can tip bitcoin. so i think the correct answer is: It depends if the individual i want to tip has a wallet or an adress where i can tip him with bitcoin.

Quick question about Bitcoin...,"Hi! New to Bitcoin here (and understanding money, in general), I'm still trying to figure it out...

Okay, so I know there are rises and falls in BTC, which prompt people to buy and sell, but do you necessarily have to sell it?

If I bought x amount of BTC and it's value fell for a bit, but then it rose to the same (or a higher value) my BTC would reflect that right? Also, as long as it continues increasing in value (long-term), one doesn't have to sell to increase profit - they can just let it continue to accrue?

Thanks for answering my question if it's dumb.",1531503575,13/07/2018 17:39:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ym1ma/quick_question_about_bitcoin/,1

Currently own about 50 S9s and have them running at a facility, but there have been problems with the local power company lately and the landlord is talking about jacking the rent to the point that mining will just cover costs .

I know Giga-Watt advertises this services, but when you contact them, they tell you they will not take customer owned machines and you have to buy their machines.

Altcoins and bitcoin are like 7 minute abs vs 8 minute abs,"Remember the movie ""There's Something About Mary""? There is a [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJgzXJ4AX_Y) where Ted is driving with a hitchhiker who pitches his idea for ""7 minute abs"", 1 minute faster than the original, widely known and popular ""8 minute abs"":

 Hitchhiker: You heard of this thing, the 8-Minute Abs?

Ted: Yeah, sure, 8-Minute Abs. Yeah, the excercise video.

Hitchhiker: Yeah, this is going to blow that right out of the water. Listen to this: 7... Minute... Abs.

Ted: Right. Yes. OK, all right. I see where you're going.

Hitchhiker: Think about it. You walk into a video store, you see 8-Minute Abs sittin' there, there's 7-Minute Abs right beside it. Which one are you gonna pick, man?

Ted: I would go for the 7.

Hitchhiker: Bingo, man, bingo. 7-Minute Abs. And we guarantee just as good a workout as the 8-minute folk.

The problem is that 7 minute abs, like altcoins, does not have the community and history like bitcoin does. 

Also, altcoins play a role in implementing sometimes first what features may be important to see someday on the bitcoin blockchain, such as speed or privacy. But I think it is nonsense that an altcoin will someday overtake bitcoin's marketcap.  These wanted features will ultimately be put into effect (as seen with the lightning network) on the most secure and most popular blockchain, bitcoin.

Update from CheapAir - now using BTCPay!,"(This email was received out a few moments ago)

Update on Our Search for a New Bitcoin Payment ProcessorDear Traveler,

A couple of months ago, I wrote to you about some challenges we were facing finding a replacement for our processor Coinbase, who had informed us they would be shutting down their merchant platform. Since 2013, we had relied on Coinbase to facilitate our acceptance of Bitcoin, and we were in unfamiliar territory to be suddenly scrambling for an alternative.

I cannot tell you how grateful I am for the overwhelming amount of thoughtful feedback we received. We went into the process thinking we were on a desperate quest to find a new processor. But thanks to many of you, we came out of it realizing we don’t need a processor at all.

For about a month now, we have been testing an open source Bitcoin payment processor, BTCPayServer, which, admittedly, I had never heard of before several of you suggested I take a look at it. Although there was a slight learning curve at first, and some engineering work to create the flow to turn crypto from you into dollars for airlines and hotels, we are thrilled with the end result. Not only does BTCPayServer enable us to circumvent BitPay’s controversial BIP-70 wallet requirement, but, after the Coinbase situation, we find it really liberating to no longer be dependent on a third party. We now have much more control of the process, which has made possible faster, more efficient order processing. We can also do a much better job of gracefully handling the occasional anomalies that are still inherent in crypto commerce. Many, many thanks to Nicolas Dorier, Predrag T, and the other BTCPayServer contributors; you’ve built a truly great product.

We know we’re not the only retailer affected by the Coinbase action that had to find new solutions or make a difficult decision. We believe that accepting digital currency has been a win-win for both CheapAir and our customers. So we decided to double down without reservation.

Besides moving to BTCPayServer, we have also set up a dedicated support team just for crypto customers, so if you need help you can reach someone who is familiar with and understands how crypto works:

Escalated, dedicated email support:BTCSupport@cheapair.com

Priority Crypto Phone Number: 1-800-619-6999

We have also begun accepting Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Litecoin. (We use GoCoin for that and they’ve been great).

Thanks again for your continued support of CheapAir.com. As always, we welcome your feedback. We’ll continue to do everything we can to make it easy to book travel with digital currency. Please continue to let us know how we’re doing!

"Barclays Bank PLC is openly hostile to crypto-currencies, and very dishonest about their reason for it!","I have a credit card from barclaycard.de, which is (and even more so used to be) rather popular in Germany. Today I received a letter with their new terms and conditions (German ""AGB"").

In addition, they are writing on the cover letter:

Original Text:     
***Kryptowährungen:*** *Wir behalten uns vor, Zahlungsaufträge zum Kauf von sogenannten Kryptowährungen künftig abzulehnen, da diese unter anderem kein gesetzliches Zahlungsmittel darstellen und der Erwerb mit einem nicht unerheblichen finanziellen Risiko verbunden sein kann.*

Translation:     
***Crypto-Currencies:*** *We reserve our right to reject payment orders for the purchase of so-called crypto-currencies, because amongst others they are not constituting legal tender and their acquisition may be connected with a not insignificant financial risk.*

What I find particularly interesting about their statement (apart from the fact that they show open hostility to cryptos in the first place):

* Why are they rejecting purchases of crypto-currencies, but not purchases of gold, silver, shares, computers, bananas, cars, knives, forks, spoons, jewellery, potatoes, bicycles, furniture, crockery, marbles, peas, cigarettes or shells? Neither of those are legal tender!

*  Why are they rejecting purchases of crypto-currencies, but not purchases of shares, options, futures, real estate or low-rated bonds? All of those may pose a substantial financial risk!

* Why are they writing ""amongst others""? What is the *real* reason that they are not mentioning?! And if that is the real reason, why are they mentioning the other reasons instead?

* Are they also rejecting SELLING of crypto-currencies?

I am thinking about sending them a friendly and very pragmatic letter asking them these sorts of questions. I would like to encourage all of you who received the same letter or read about their new anti-crypto terms, to do the same! Please do remain friendly at any instant, but be right to the point, pertinacious and persistent in case their answer is avoiding some of your questions (which I am almost sure will be the case).",1531515992,13/07/2018 21:06:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ynsgz/barclays_bank_plc_is_openly_hostile_to/,1

Alternative Block Chains : be safe!," haven't seen anybody post about what would be my biggest worry if I were trying out alternative block chains. I realize this may be perceived as ""Gavin is FUD'ding anything that isn't bitcoin!""  (FUD == Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt)  But I think some of you might be forgetting some basic computer security fundamentals in the excitement to be early adopters.  


When I first heard about bitcoin, my questions were:  


1) Can it possibly work (do the ideas for how it works make sense)?  
2) Is it a scam?  
3) If it is not a scam, could it open my computer up to viruses/trojans if I run it?  


I answered those questions by:  


1) Reading and understanding Satoshi's whitepaper.  Then thinking about it for a day or two and reading it again.  
2) Finding out everything I could about the project.  I read every forum thread here (there were probably under a hundred threads back then) and read Satoshi's initial postings on the crypto mailing list.  
3) Downloaded and skimmed the source code to see if it looked vulnerable to buffer overflow or other remotely exploitable attacks.  


If I were going to experiment with an alternative block-chain, I'd go through the same process again. But I'm an old conservative fuddy-duddy.  


If you want to take a risk on a brand-new alternative block-chain, I'd strongly suggest that you:  


1) Run the software in a virtual machine or on a machine that doesn't contain anything valuable.

**""Any major reversal in policies is unlikely, but the government seems to believe a gradual shift in attitude toward crypto-based assets is needed. What regulators should do is figure out how to regulate them properly and prudently as Korea needs to put more emphasis on blockchain technology after obtaining knowhow and understanding of the possible flipside of cryptocurrency trading.""**

For some individuals bitcoin has no value because It's not tangible. It's just ones and zeros on a computer.   


The fact is that, just like gold, silver and diamonds, bitcoin's value comes from consensus. People see the utility and the power of technology and agree that bitcoin has value, so it's valuable. And unlike diamonds, bitcoin didn't need a big New York ad agency to convince people of this. Its growth has been completely organic.

Use of joint management of financial resources.

Transparent and accessible reporting on credit facilities.

Liberalization of interest for the use of credit.

Simple Tips Keeping Your Bitcoin from Hackers.,"\- We must have our own way to keep our Bitcoin safe. The account we use must have a unique password, and not easily guessed.  


\- Do not equate account passwords associated with Bitcoin with other accounts such as social media, because it is vulnerable to hack, let alone the followers of its social media a lot.  


\- Use two-factor or 2FD authentication. Additional security layers are easy to apply. Quite a few apps like Google Authenticator as a 2FD installation provider. In essence, it works as a second security layer after the password. When you've entered a keyword into your account, the system will request a two-factor authentication code. The six-digit code does not need to be memorized because it changes every 30 seconds.  


\- And one more, do not trust everyone. Suppose we provide information about our Bitcoin account to our Mother, it is not impossible that our mother could just tell it to someone else. With the spread of such information will increase the potential for breaking.",1531564179,14/07/2018 10:29:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ysdnh/simple_tips_keeping_your_bitcoin_from_hackers/,1

Will bitcoin bring back a return to lower personal liability.,"Under a gold based economy people were rarely sued because gold was generally stored outside of any 3rd party custodianship making it near impossible to seize or sometimes even know about.

Since our economy has moved towards counter party risk in all aspects of finance from bank accounts to real property, law suits have surged because those assets are easily obtainable by creditors.

With bitcoin being outside that counter party structure and therefore potentially completely outside any jurisdiction, will bitcoin start to become viewed of as the only asset that cant be confiscated and liquidated in a lawsuit? 

Instead of spending thousands of dollars to set up a corporation or trust structure (potentially off-shore) just to protect assets from potential future creditors, bitcoin could be viewed of as ""self protecting"" because of its bearer-instrument nature. It would be near impossible to sue an individual and obtain access to their bitcoin through a counter party if that bitcoin is held in a personal wallet.

Bitcoin might just bring an end to these never ending ridulous lawsuits that ONLY exist because financial assets today are so easily siezed.

A paper wallet might be the equivelant of an offshore holding company in terms of its ability to protect financial assets.

It should be a human right to be able to protect ones personal assets from personal liability, and it is, but before bitcoin that luxury was only available to the rich who were able to afford incorporating a company to hold assets or setting up a trust. Now it is available to anyone through a paper wallet.

Bitcoin: Next Bull Market Could Propel Prices To $100K,"Summary

Bitcoin has shed more than $200 billion in market value, and its price has cratered by about 70% since the bear market began late last year.

However, this is nothing new for Bitcoin, as prior bear markets have erased 75-80% of gains achieved in parabolic bull stampedes.

This has not stopped Bitcoin from continuing its long-term trajectory higher, and this bear market is no exception.

Bitcoin and other systemically important coins represent a legitimate alternative to the current status quo financial order, and are likely to be worth much more in the future.

This Bitcoin bear market is very likely close to bottoming, and the subsequent bull run should enable prices to move substantially higher.

Seeking funds,"I have had a dream for a very long time, and that dream is about running an Albergue for Pilgrims on the way of the St. James in Spain. For those of you who do not even know what an Albergue or what The way of the St. James are - I will explain you.

Back in 2009 I decided to do a walk in Spain after reading a book, by Paulo Coelho, called the Alchemist. This journey is taking you by foot from St. Jean Pied de Port in France to Santiago de Compostela  in Spain, and the distance is aprox 900 km. Historically this is a Catholic tradition, and those who managed to do at least the last 100 km until they reach the Spanish city in northwest was rewarded with a diploma written in the Latin language.

Despite the piece of paper this is a life changing journey, and since I am a Pilgrim in both my soul and heart, I have used it as a place to get back to for meditation - and get out of the stress that the life is bringing on my shoulders. There might not be a better medicine in the Universe that outcompete  the power of having a good walk. 

There are several routes but the French camino is the most common one - and from the first day I did it I have had a dream about running an Albergue (hostel) for Pilgrims. The rules are quite simple, you get a place to sleep, eat and shower for a low cost - and you have to move on the next day since there are coming new Pilgrims every day. Basically it is a bloodline of Pilgrims covering the whole route until you reach Santiago de Compostela.

Santiago in Spain are among the three holiest cities in the Christian history, after Jerusalem and and Rome. In English the name means St. James under the stars - and it got its name because they obviously found his relics there. For those who do not know about St. James, he was the brother of John - who was the best friend of Jesus.

There are aprox 300k people getting their Diploma for doing this journey every year. They come from all over the world, but are mostly represented within the Catholic/Protestant countries, but people from Asia has also been highly represented in recent years. 

I got married with my wife 3 weeks ago, and I think it is about time for us to aim for what we are supposed to do with our future. Everyone who knows what dreams are, and how much they mean to each and one of you - would understand how much it would mean to me serving the Pilgrims all year around. It has even been made a movie about this journey called The Way with Hollywood actors like Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez.

It  is a touching movie, and I did my first walk in 2009 - and was just about one month ahead of them making it. I guess I came to Santiago aprox the time they started filming, and to be honest with you - the film is about a father who is loosing his son dying on the way. Some few years later the same thing happened to me - my son died, and even that I am still struggling with grieve and existential questions around the loss of him, the dream still lives on.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9PjBR8W74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9PjBR8W74)

In this matter I need your help to realize my dream which is an Albergue (hostel) for Pilgrims who only will pay for their stay with Cryptos. I even have an idea for those who do not have cryptos to install a small ATM there to change Fiat into Crypto, and it should be in the the spirit of journey - simple and not posh, but to serve the Pilgrims.

If you want to help me reaching my dream, feel free to donate any Crypto currency to me - and if I manage to reach the amount it will cost to get hold of a nice building, I will activate and get started. However, now it is all about finding funding for it and you can donate funds to the addresses below.

Fuck banks,Wells Fargo deposited someone else's money into our account. They then removed it putting us at - $19k. We called and complained. They acknowledged the error was this and fixed it. It then reset to being overdrawn by $19k. They fixed it again and then it went overdrawn $18k. It has been doing this for a week. We have no access to our money. My gf is pregnant and we have a kid already. We rent. We need access to our money. Even worse is that they hung up on us for getting upset and using curse words. They said we need to keep it professional. Um you are a customer service representative at a place that is screwing us out of our livelihood. We are home on the weekend. How is it that we have to be professional? If rent bounces we are screwed. We can't just close the account since it is overdrawn. We can't just close the account because auto pay goes in there and that takes months to update for the state of California (one of our employers). We cannot even withdraw $500 at a time.

I was looking for simple to use Bitcoin libraries for Python3

pybitcointools by Vitalik seemed to be quite well with a good abstracting one. Unfortunately that one is no longer being maintained and seems we now should use python-bitcoinlib which doesn't have good examples and documentation on how to use it.

What I need are just simple things such as what ""pybitcointools"" offered plus a way to get the ammount of bitcoin of a specific address.

Opinion on Bitcoin Future Price,"Hi all. Bitcoin price has been fluctuating quite a lot this year. With the price making new low as of recently, a lot of us might be thinking where will it be heading in the future.

In light of this, I am conducting a quick survey on the opinion of Reddit's community on the price. Do you think bitcoin will hit back again to USD 10,000 by the end of this year? Some of you might say no chance, other might say it's too low.

Either way, I do appreciate your effort in taking the quick survey. I might post the result on Reddit to share with you guys, provided the result is large enough. Meanwhile, I plan to give away rewards (maybe $100) for those who guess the price right, as a appreciation for taking the survey :).

Quantum Computers confirmed? A new development in the 21e8 mystery...," [~~#~~**00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a?src=hash)   


This is the has that has gotten everyone so worked up, I'm sure you've seen it by now...  


The theory is that ""21e800"" is Bitcoin ""referencing itself"", in a feedback type of loop, or some might even go far as to say that it's alive or quantum computers are at play. The reason being is because the amount of energy necessary to ""create"" that block hash and specify ""21e800"" is astronomical, literally, you need stars (plural)....  


What if I said that the vanity has was 10 characters instead of 6, would that pique your interest?  


What if I said it was 14 characters?   


What if I said the ENTIRE HASH held significant meaning?  


Call me crazy, you won't be the first, but hear me out...  


""21"" = Total Supply of BTC in millions 

""21e8"" = Total Satoshis (scientific notation)

 ""e8"" = Theory of Everything

""00"" = 2 zeros extra, calling back to the Genesis Block (Bitcoin's Birthday)  


This is where most people stop... 

The massive calculations they've done are already astronomical assuming that just these first 6 characters were mined for ""vanity hashing""... It would literally require entire STARS and years of time to ""create"" this vanity hash with only 6 chosen digits...  


I will now try to find logical reasoning through this ENTIRE HASH, so bare with me... Skeptics, you will have a field day belittling me, but I frankly do not care...  


21e800 is followed by ""c1"", a quick google search reveals that C1 is internet slang for ""Affirmative, Roger That""  


So directly following a 6 digit string that ""appears"" to be self-referential, we have 2 extra digits that are basically saying ""Yes, I just referenced myself, affirmative""  


This may just be a passing thought, but this self-reference is confirmed a THIRD time with ANOTHER ""e8"" following the trailing ""c1"" affirmation...  


This hash of Bitcoin has now referenced itself with 10 digits extra... That is a magnitude more difficult than just solving the hash for the preliminary 6 digit ""21e800""...   


I will now reference that hash as ""21e800c1e8""...  


If you understand Bitcoin enough, you understand that it is a complex file storage system designed for the ""Bitcoin"" token that we use as ""money"", but simply put; Bitcoin is a file system for data being stored on disks around the world (decentralized)  


The two digits following ""21e800c1e8"" AGAIN reference themselves as Bitcoin in the characters ""df""...  


""df"" is an acronym for ""disk-free"", a reference to total available free space on a file system, this again could very well be Bitcoin referencing itself and it's ability to store ever-increasing amounts of information...  


If you're with me this far, the self-referencing black hole of a hash is now ""21e800c1e8df""... That's now TWELVE digits of self-reference... Not 6, 12! Do the math on THAT difficulty...

The next two digits are a 5 &amp; 1, do I really have to explain what that could be referencing? Area 51! This is also the digits where I believe the ""self-referencing"" may stop, and a message may begin? I'm not sure if 51 is part of the self-reference, or part of the message, but I'm quite sure that's where it diverges...  


The following 3 digits are ""b22"", upon Google searching; ""b22"" seems to be the model number for THE most widely used ""light-bulb"" sockets, is this referencing a source of light? Illumination? Enlightenment?  


""b22"" is followed by another ""c1"", as if to say ""Yes, Affirmative, What you are seeing is correct"", this is another 7 digits of potentially intentional ""meaning"" added to the 12 that consists of ""21e800c1e8df""  


The hash will now be referenced as ""21e800c1e8df51b22c1""...  


I have found meaning amongst the remaining digits, but it seems to be referencing ""us humans"" and our ""establishments"" rather than itself...  


588 is the Electronic Funds Transfer form for [CMS.gov](https://CMS.gov) (medicare)

E5 could be referencing the US Military pay-grade of E-5, or it could be referencing E5 (5&amp;#37; ethanol, 95&amp;#37; gasoline)

A624 is a road, named 'Glossop', roughly translates to: Utopia, Heaven, or Paradise

BE - Exist, to occur or take place

A17 - Area 17, closely linked to Artificial Intelligence

E9 is the collection of 9 countries holding 70&amp;#37; of illiterate adults, dedicated to education

FAA = Federal Aviation Administration

34 is supposedly an ""Angel-Number"" linked to intelligence, and growth

b2d = Business to Developer

c4a =  Anaphylatoxin that seems to be linked to ""immune"" disorders, immune disorders by the way are ones where the cell can't recognize friendly cells, or itself for that matter, immune deficiency can be classified as ""loss of consciousness"" among the cells in your body...  


CALL ME CRAZY, I DON'T CARE, I WELCOME IT

You tell me the odds of this hash generating such massive interest for no reason, comparable to a black hole, it sucked people in for a reason... Now tell me the odds &amp; difficulty of either creating this entire hash as a vanity, or it randomly coming together and each portion having meaning, arguable RELATED meaning...  


Truth.... Truth will always be stranger than Fiction...  


Will you ever look at  [~~#~~**00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a?src=hash) the same again?

Lightning - Blazingly fast,"Hi,

Felt like I had to share this. I decided to finally test the lightning network. I have been following it for a long time and waiting for it to be usable.

Got my self Eclair. Loaded with couple of mBTC. Opened a lightning channel, worked straight away. 
Went to lightningspin a tried to send some satoshis. Instantly after I scanned the payment request my computer screen turned green. Payment received. Amazing tech!

Congrats guy's, times will most definitely be brighter with Bitcoin.",1531601721,14/07/2018 20:55:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ywdwb/lightning_blazingly_fast/,1

How well does Bitcoin function as a currency?,"Successful currencies meet three criteria:   


(1) they are in widespread use as medium of exchange   
(2) they serve as unit of account   
(3) they are a stable store of value.   


Most sovereign currencies fully meet all three criteria.

A brilliant smart contract game,"**Fomo3D**

If you are interested about block-chain technology and apps running on it you have to participate to this brilliant and addictive game(And also best time to play is now during this bear market) :

Fomo3D is a decentralized, trustless blockchain game running directly on the Ethereum network. Here are the basics of how Fomo3D works:

This is a lottery game in which the last person to buy a key at the end of a round wins the pot!  
During a round, people can purchase 1 or more keys which adds time to the timer and marks them as the current leader. With each key purchase during the round, the key price increases slightly.  
Players receive a stream of passive income from the game as keys are bought during the round.  
When the timer reaches zero, last person to buy a key wins! (F3D players/P3D holders get a piece too!)

With a few cool added game mechanics:

Players select from one of four teams which determine certain rules during the round.  
P3D holders receive dividends on each key purchase and at the end of the round.  
Players can purchase a vanity URL and/or refer your friends to the game for extra rewards.  
Buying keys offers you a &amp;#37; chance to receive an ""airdrop"" winning ETH from a growing side-pot!

For a more detailed rundown, check out the Rules of the Game section.

Game Modes

Fomo3D is split up into two separate games each designed with custom rulesets to generate different experiences, volumes, and different scales of jackpots: long and quick. Long is launching first, and then quick will be launched at a later date.

Notable differences include that long does not have an ICO phase, uses different timer durations, and has a totally different key price scaling model than the quick mode. For full details, check out the Game Modes section.

Magic Blockchain Technology:

Fomo3D is a decentralized application (Dapp) running on the Ethereum exit-scam network. The game consists of a smart contract (an autonomous program on the ethereum network) carefully programmed and deployed so that we as developers have no influence or impact upon the game, the ethereum in the contract, or advantages thereof. The application itself is completely trustless, will run until the ethereum network dies and no matter how tantalizingly large the pot gets, will only be paid out according to the game rules.

This means that to successfully experience the glory of running away with a giant wallet of Ethereum, or cursing the name of thine enemies as they attempt to do the same, You need Metamask or a compatible Ethereum wallet with a bit of eth in it to send to Metamask so you can suffer along with us!

To learn more about how trustless blockchain technology powers Fomo3D and the team behind this project, check out the Team JUST page.

Alias Protocol! Facilitating more convenient spends.,"I've been working on a, open-source protocol that I think could be valuable to the Bitcoin ecosystem. I like it because it is a totally optional opt-in type of solution to tying aliases (usernames) to addresses. This will allow wallet software to have UI/UX more similar to that of venmo or cash app.

There are a couple attack vectors lined out in the document. If you can think of more, or have ideas for improvement feel free to submit issues/pull requests!

UChain Public Presale Information - Medium," [https://medium.com/uchain/uchain-public-presale-information-87de9e3df8d4](https://medium.com/uchain/uchain-public-presale-information-87de9e3df8d4)

Only **ETH addresses** that have been **whitelisted and passed KYC** will be allowed to take part in the presale. Any and all transactions from a non-whitelisted address will be rejected by our smart contract!

We recommend using **at least 200,000 Gas Limit** when sending your contribution in order for the smart contract to execute successfully.

In order to avoid a gas war, a cap of **50 Gwei and 250,000 Gas Limit**has been set -any transaction above those caps will be rejected by our smart contract!

In the **1st round** (June 20th / Day One), the min/max contribution cap is set to **2ETH**. Any amount different than 2ETH will be rejected by our smart contract on Day One!

In the **2nd Round** (June 21st /Day Two), the **minimum contribution**will be **0.5ETH** and the **maximum contribution 5ETH**. Any amount lesser than 0.5ETH or greater than 5ETH will be rejected by our smart contract on Day Two!

The Presale smart contract will reject any and all transactions upon reaching the 8000ETH Presale hardcap. With Day 2 only taking place if the hardcap is not reached on Day One!

&gt;***Timestamps***

The smart contract is set to accept transactions from the first block with a timestamp later than June 20th, 10AM UTC+1.

Likewise, it is set to raise/lower the caps for round two for the first block with a timestamp later than June 21st, 10:30AM UTC+1. (only in case the hardcap hasn’t been reached by that time)

On June 21st, after 10:00AM UTC+1, until the Day Two starts at 10:30AM UTC+1, all transactions will be rejected. This 30-minute space has been introduced to clearly separate the two contribution stages and give you time to prepare your Day Two contributions.

&gt;***Day Two Contributions***

In the case that our hardcap is not reached on Day One, all whitelisted addresses can contribute on Day Two, regardless of their contribution on Day One.

&gt;***Token Distribution/Lock***

The tokens will be visible in your wallet as soon as you contribute to the smart contract. However, as announced earlier, they will remain locked, i.e. not transferable, until around one month after the Crowdsale concludes (subject to change).

&gt;***Presale Bonus Tokens***

The 15&amp;#37; bonus tokens will remain locked for **3 months** from the token sale and will be made transferable on October 12th.

&gt;***Crowdsale Details/Whitelist***

As said before, all Presale Whitelisted users that passed KYC will automatically be added to the Crowdsale Whitelist, which is expected to take place in July. More details on the Crowdsale are to be announced after the Presale has finished.

As we near our presale, we’re excepting an increase in scammer activity, please stay safe and remember that the only communication channels used will be our webpage and the telegram announcement channel.

My thoughts on the CBOE ETF,"I know, I know, I'm in it for the technology, but I can't help but get excited about the CBOE ETF. If it gets approved, it is hard not to think it will lead to a big boost to the bitcoin price. And this us why this time things are different:

1. It is the CBOE. Respected by the SEC more than a couple of rowers - sorry Winklevi - I love you really.

2. The assets will be insured.

3. Some of the main markets (US, Japan, Korea, China)  have made big steps in clarifying the regulatory situation for bitcoin. 

4. The CBOE doesn'the apply for licenses that it does not expect to obtain. I would assumes that discussions were held with the SEC before even applying.

5. There are professional grade custodial services available now (which the ETF will leverage) - these were not available last time.

6. Kind of related to 2 &amp; 5, but the presence of an insurance and custodial market shows how the space is maturing.

So that's it. Share your thoughts. ",1531637760,15/07/2018 06:56:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8yzxng/my_thoughts_on_the_cboe_etf/,1

Bitcoin vs Money,"Hello everyone, i seriously don't understand why people starting hate Bitcoin and other digital/crypto currencies.  
I guess many people stop remembering why Money is worth something. Lets imagine, if you couldn't buy food and clothes for your money USD/Euro etc. would you still use money? No because you can't pay with it, Bitcoin was created to free people from the goverment, collecting all your data and treating people like slaves and earning money from our hard work. Bitcoin is falling down into the trash can because people didn't remember WHY it was created. It wasn't made to become rich in 2 months or so, you should remember, something has only a value when people share the same thoughts. If no one uses Bitcoin it will become useless.  


If you will be able to pay for your apartment and food by using Bitcoin, at this point the goverment will shit their pants. That's the main two things all people need, you need a roof over your had same as you need food. If you can pay for both using Bitcoin... the game is done for ""Paper Money"".

Survey on Future Bitcoin Price," Hi all. Bitcoin price has been fluctuating quite a lot this year. With the price making new low as of recently, a lot of us might be thinking where will it be heading in the future.

In light of this, I am conducting a quick survey on the opinion of Reddit's bitcoin community on the price. Do you think bitcoin will hit back again to USD 10,000 by the end of this year? Some of you might say no chance, other might say it's too low.

Either way, I do appreciate your effort in taking the quick survey. I might post the result on Reddit to share with you guys, provided the result is large enough. Meanwhile, I plan to give away rewards (maybe $100) for those who guess the price right, as a appreciation token for taking the survey :).

Here's the survey:

Andreas Antonopoulos absolutely Butchers Linux's Origin Story,"[Measuring Success: Price or Principle \[11:35\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPMsbgWl9p4&amp;t=11m35s)

For what it's worth:

1. Linus Torwalds just wrote another proprietary piece of software until it was released under GPL 0.12
2. Richard Stallman spearheaded the free software movement that all those open ideals are based on that AA is talking about. GPL wouldn't exist without GNU/RMS
3. GNU is the OS that you are running. Linux is a Kernel
4. Linux the kernel wouldn't exist without gcc

I get that the free software movement hasn't been the most sexy sell, but I would have expected more from AA.

tl;dr: Explaining Linux's origin story without mentioning GNU/RMS/Free Software (free as in freedom, not free beer) is to tread on all the ideals that made it happen in the first place.

rtca.crossd.io - Real Time Cryptocurrencies Arbitrages," Hi everyone,

I posted here few hours ago a link to my project but I decided to open a thread to discuss with you about it in order to maybe get some feedback and suggestions to improve it.

Few months ago I started working on a project of real time arbitrage platform investors could use to effectively exploit arbitrages opportunities. We have been working hard to provide something fully working and today we succeeded.

[https://rtca.crossd.io](https://rtca.crossd.io/) allow you to overview arbitrages and see exactly what to do to earn the profit. We take in account fees of course but also deposit/withdraw status automatically.

Our next step will be to add exchanges and that could be interesting to get some ideas from you guys in addition to our research.

We will also love to get your impression about it (clarity, efficieny, etc.) We opened a Twitter ([https://twitter.com/crossdio](https://twitter.com/crossdio)) and a Medium ([https://medium.com/@crossd.io](https://medium.com/@crossd.io)) account to talk with our users so don't hesitate to take a look at it.

Survey on Future Bitcoin Price,"Hi all. Bitcoin price has been fluctuating quite a lot this year. With the price making new low as of recently, a lot of us might be thinking where will it be heading in the future.

In light of this, I am conducting a quick survey on the opinion of Reddit's bitcoin community on the price. Do you think bitcoin will hit back again to USD 10,000 by the end of this year? Some of you might say no chance, other might say it's too low.

Either way, I do appreciate your effort in taking the quick survey. I might post the result on Reddit to share with you guys, provided the result is large enough. Meanwhile, I plan to give away rewards (maybe $100) for those who guess the price right, as a appreciation token for taking the survey :).

Here's the survey: btcprediction .us-3 .evennode .com

Thanks again for your effort!",1531661791,15/07/2018 13:36:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z1r9c/survey_on_future_bitcoin_price/,1

Is it true that BTC is heavily censored from bad press?,"Im sort of new to crypto (about 1 year). I have read an increasing number of articles and listened to a lot of podcasts where they claim Bitcoin, especially the BTC's reddit page is heavily censored and one is not allowed to post anything negative (even constructive criticism) else it will simply get downvoted and / or deleted.  


I dont know if this is true or not? If it is, im not sure I would like to be part of BTC, i**f it is not true (which I sincerely hope it is not) then I will continue to be a Bitcoin maximalist.**   


I would just like to get clarification on above question from community and / or admins.

Why the Bitcoin ETF Will NOT be approved on August 10,"This is how you are all being manipulated, always forgetting about the misinformation being spread that didn't deliver in the past like Chinese New Year or some other bullshit every 2 weeks. None of you want to hear this, this would probably be downvoted and be seen by like 3 people... because you would probably be reading the headline in denial as always when someone has something bad for crypto to say, meanwhile the whole crypto community is supporting and spreading/posting the fake bullish news that we all want to hear and time and time again it never fucking happens.  


Wake the fuck up people. We are in a fucking bear market, we know that institutional money is 'coming' and waiting for some more clarity. Now do you think they'd be getting in at around 6-8k when the SEC approves of it and we would 'never see the bottom again'? Absolutely fucking not. They will be jumping in at 3-5k or even less and in the shadows that no one can see which is OTC, the hype that will build the price up until August 10 will inevitably cause a lot of people to just sell off everything and just give up on crypto thinking there would be no future once they reject it.  A few weeks later oh look \[some new bullish/FOMO news\], and the market will repeat itself, like it has for the past year. I believe in bitcoin as much as everyone that is still here and I hold a decent portfolio, but we will not see another crazy bullrun for at least another full year from now, the big institutions and millionaires will invest once it is unsaturated enough and once the price is low enough moving sideways for a few years just like after 2013, they are the reason why over a third have checked out and way more to come. Using the same lies over and over again until you just give up and cut your losses.   


Now lets go to if they actually do approve it... how long does it take for people to realize that fundamentals don't mean jackshit in a bear market? But I guess everyones memory is just so bad when it comes to investing. If you actually read this don't buy into the current hype.

Qyno Coin Introduces Game Changing Financial Ecosystem.,"Qyno Coin Introduces Game Changing Financial Ecosystem for Instant, Anonymous Cryptocurrency Payments

With global financial systems poised to adopt blockchain technology, Qyno’s unveiling of a low cost, anonymous and instant alternative to Bitcoin couldn’t be more timely+

Qyno Coin has pulled back the curtain on a financial ecosystem that finally affords users a lighting fast, near-zero transaction fee alternative to Bitcoin that is both anonymous and secured by masternodes. The security of Qyno Coin achieved by the use of masternodes has the secondary benefit of being financially rewarding to users who choose to become masternode owners on the Qyno network.

Masternodes on the Qyno blockchain enable next-level validation in ways that standard mining can not. Masternodes are essentially decentralized servers owned by anyone who purchases the collateral amount of Qyno Coin (QNO) and holds them in the Qyno Wallet. These masternodes do two critical pieces of work. First, they allow for the performance of functions like *InstantSend* and *PrivateSend*, both of which are Qyno Coin features allowing for transactions that are confirmed in the blink of an eye and guarantee anonymity for both parties involved. Second, Qyno masternodes secure the network because they agree on transactions by consensus. The work performed by Qyno masternodes is rewarded with a massive 90% block reward, the highest of any masternode coin in the crypto market.

The Qyno blockchain uses a Neoscrypt hashing algorithm which is so cryptographically secure that it is ASIC resistant and has the secondary benefit of being less memory intensive than usual hashing algorithms. Because Qyno is a Neoscrypt based coin, it is easier for a person with normal computing power to participate in mining it. Due to properties which keep Qyno Coin transactions fast, secure and near-zero cost, the Qyno financial ecosystem makes a perfect host for eCommerce solutions.

“With anonymous, nearly zero-cost transactions allowing merchants to do business in a secure and instant fashion, the Qyno platform enables the next generation of eCommerce on the blockchain. Using an industry-leading masternode model to secure the Qyno platform means merchants will never have to worry about the safety of traded assets,” said the Qyno team in a recent statement.

Merchants thinking of integrating Qyno into their eCommerce environment will have a major incentive to do so. Qyno’s merchant gateway, called Q-PayGate, allows for any tool, product, or merchant service to be seamlessly integrated into the Qyno blockchain. Merchants who accept Qyno payments using the Q-PayGate plugin will be able to host their own Qyno masternodes using the generated funds, creating a stream of revenue as they profit from both their business income and the ROI generated by owning Qyno masternodes.

Using cryptocurrencies as collaterals for MCV-CAP BCB4U-based loans," Using the blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency, to create loans can be somewhat problematic due to many issues. Namely, the challenges associated with tokenization of real-world assets and high volatility levels render the use of cryptocurrencies as collateral very hard to implement. We know that the crypto community is filled with highly experienced individuals who have tried every trick in crypto's ""black book"", so we would like to hear your thoughts about this. 

Should cryptocurrencies be hedged initially during the process of collateralization of loans? If so, what is the best way to do so in your opinion?",1531678200,15/07/2018 18:10:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z3od4/using_cryptocurrencies_as_collaterals_for_mcvcap/,1

The next halving and why you should own a bitcoin or two.,"I have been able to get some very successful people into bitcoin over the past year. Even during this bear market I have stayed extremely positive. My predictions that I have presented to people have been extremely accurate.

I grew up in a small town in West Virginia. When I was 12 years old my family moved to an even smaller town called Salem WV. Early 1990s. I was starving for communication and social interaction. One day a kid I went to school with invited me over to play his PS1, a game called Loaded had just came out. While we were playing I heard a young man yelling and smashing something. I asked what it was, he said it was his teenage brother. So I walked to his room and there sat a 16 year old with a broken keyboard, irate at his dos screen. I asked him why he was mad, he told me about this thing called the internet. You can talk to people online he said. He was designing a search engine he proclaimed. He showed me how to hook in a phone line so we could send data back and worth when I was home in the country from my computer. He gave me an AOL mod account he hacked and something called AOHell. I quickly found out I could make people online have a terrible experience, I could also trade porn files peer to peer.

I transferred back to a school in the city when I was 15. The gang I ran with rode skateboards. We went to one of my friends houses and in his room with 5 other guys I noticed a computer in the corner. I told them that I could hook a phone line to the back and get porn for free. No one believed me, so that's what I did. The kid was amazed that I could get magic naked girls to appear out of no where. He yelled for his mom to see. I wasn't allowed to come back after that. 

I later figured out how to use my scanner at 16 years old and to change my newly issued drivers license age to 21. Soon many of my friends were able to buy beer. I got into trouble over that and then they put holograms on the new IDs.

I figured out how to set up a hacked copy of recording software. Set up a studio to record rap songs when I was 20 years old. It was very exciting. 

This is a pattern with technology I have repeated over and over. It's fascinating to me. What can be accomplished with the internet. It is complete freedom. 

I ran into bitcoin years ago. A buddy of mine in South Korea told me about it online. So I decided to research it and fell in love with the design. Before this in 2007 I had designed a business and posted it online. It was about taking digital properties off one platform and selling them to other people. In world of warcraft you could mine ore or gold and sell it to other players on Ebay. This was very intriguing to me. I feel very connected to bitcoin because of certain similarities and parallels. 

I followed and tinkered with it a bit and fell in love. I never really thought about it as the best investment in the world until the last halving in 2016 and saw what happened in 2017. I remember bitcoin hitting $2000 and thinking it was scary. You couldn't go wrong then and everyone involved looked like a genius. I'd tell people it was going to hit $10,000. Then it did and a couple of my friends sold theirs. I always just spent mine. These crypto charts speak to me. I'm here because I believe I am the best at what I do. I knew the market would turn bear. 

It's been very good to me on the small holdings I've been able to accumulate. I came to reddit 6 months ago when John Oliver roasted bitcoin. He said there were hundreds of thousands of people here that were like me. I'm very glad I came and today is my 6 month old birthday on reddit and I've meant some amazing people. Thought I would share in my favorite sub.

What I believe is next:

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency guaranteed to go up in value. This bear market could last a while, it could end this month. It could also stay at a 6000 dollar to 7000 for the next year. What I do know for a fact is that when it is 2021 bitcoin will be over 6 figures. I'd like to think we will be over 10,000 by 2019. The next halving is going to be mid 2020. The 12.5 bitcoin miner reward gets cut to 6.25. What I would recommend you do between now and the next halving is accumulate as much bitcoin as possible. You cannot go wrong at 6000 to 7000, in a 3 to 5 year hold it really won't matter. I am mining and buying as much as possible to this day. If you are sitting on 1 bitcoin come 2025, you'll be very wealthy and never have to work. Things will be very different then. Get your satoshis up and hodl tight. There is no better investment in the world.

Thank you reddit for having me, cheers.

Is decentralisation the end goal or rather a means to something else?,"&gt;Decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group. Concepts of decentralization have been applied to group dynamics and management science in private businesses and organizations, political science, law and public administration, economics and technology.



Critiques

&gt;Factors hindering decentralization include weak local administrative or technical capacity, which may result in inefficient or ineffective services; inadequate financial resources available to perform new local responsibilities, especially in the start-up phase when they are most needed; or inequitable distribution of resources. Decentralization can make national policy coordination too complex; it may allow local elites to capture functions; local cooperation may be undermined by any distrust between private and public sectors; decentralization may result in higher enforcement costs and conflict for resources if there is no higher level of authority. Additionally, decentralization may not be as efficient for standardized, routine, network-based services, as opposed to those that need more complicated inputs. If there is a loss of economies of scale in procurement of labor or resources, the expense of decentralization can rise, even as central governments lose control over financial resources.

&gt;Other challenges, and even dangers, include the possibility that corrupt local elites can capture regional or local power centers, while constituents lose representation; patronage politics will become rampant and civil servants feel compromised; further necessary decentralization can be stymied; incomplete information and hidden decision-making can occur up and down the hierarchies; centralized power centers can find reasons to frustrate decentralization and bring power back to themselves.[citation needed]

&gt;It has been noted that while decentralization may increase ""productive efficiency"" it may undermine ""allocative efficiency"" by making redistribution of wealth more difficult. Decentralization will cause greater disparities between rich and poor regions, especially during times of crisis when the national government may not be able to help regions needing it.

But the end of this story will be that Bitcoin will rule them all. Bitcoin is well approved with a strong community, the community of some shitcoins are often only paid shills.

"In a country like Venezuela, which has 3+ different exchange rates depending on one's position in society, what rate would be used for buying Bitcoin?","Similarly, isn't Venezuela's government controlled cryptocurrency (the petro) an oxymoron? Although I'm just a beginner, I assume a decentralized and democratic block chain would be the primary reason for people turning to currency such a bitcoin (unless I'm wrong, which may be the case). By now there are two ways for acquiring BC in Venezuela, mining and simply trading it for the Bolivar. Because of a constantly fluctuating exchange rate, BC is becoming really big in the country; would that give it the potential to become the first country wholly dependent on cryptocurrency?

So begins the great payment wars,"So, now that the block size debate has concluded with Segwit the clear winner, it appears that the next big rift in Bitcoin will be between various payment processors.

BitPay appears to not want their merchants to accept bitcoin so they have created all sorts of hoops to jump through with just a hand full of wallets that you have to use to spend on their platform (not to mention requiring artificially high transaction fees and displaying bcash as having lower fees every time anyone uses them). CoInbAse got out and left all of their clients hanging, including Expedia.

BtcPay appears to be the popular alternative though a bit more technically difficult for companies to use. 

Users are going to start wanting payment processors that use Lightning Network like BtcPay Server.

I've personally had to start using PayPal for my web hosting service because they use BitPay. I wanted to move BTC from my Korean wallet to localbitcoins but they were incompatible.

What was once simple, just use a Bitcoin address to send your bitcoins, has become yet another fork in the Bitcoin world.",1531711434,16/07/2018 03:23:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z7kom/so_begins_the_great_payment_wars/,1

Dave Bitcoin from walletrecoveryservices did it again!,"So, back in 2013 I managed to get my 2.44 BTC stuck in a wallet, because I over-complicated my password (24 characters long with some ""trick"" in it, which I couldn't remember anymore).

I wrote to Dave from walletrecoveryservices, told him what I remembered of the password and he tried \~875k variations from it, unfortunately with no luck.

Over the years, as the price of BTC continued to increase, I've tried multiple times to try to remember the password and got frustrated time and time again; so eventually I gave up on the hope of recovering the lost 2.44 Bitcoins.

This until last week, when Dave wrote to me after almost 5 years!!

He managed to crack the password based upon my initial PW and provided me the solution.

I couldn't have been more happy, as I lost almost all hope of recovering them.

Now after so much time, at last, my BTCs returned home :)

I can only recommend Dave to the whole community, if you ever need help recovering your passphrase and remember part of it.

He is definitely the best guy!

Thank you Dave!!

Lopp: more meatspace crypto attacks on the way,"*It used to be the case that what happened in crypto, stayed in crypto. No more.*

One of the unwelcome side-effects of the massive increase in value across the 

crypto markets has been an extension of the Wild West culture from cyberspace 

into the real world (aka ‘meatspace’). A growing list of people have been held up at 

gunpoint or otherwise threatened for their bitcoins, or because of their involvement 

in crypto.

Jameson Lopp, a well-known bitcoin developer who himself was SWATted last year, 

courtesy of one anonymous member of the crypto world who didn’t agree with his 

views on the scaling debate, comments:

‘23 physical attacks targeted against crypto owners cataloged thus far. 10 of them 

occurred in the past 6 months. Seems to be strong evidence that the rate of 

physical attacks is accelerating.’ See [https://twitter.com/lopp/status/](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/)

1015945799652474880 

Lopp has started an open source repository of physical attacks, so that the 

community can ‘help keep track of the dynamic security landscape for crypto asset 

owners’.

I fell for the fake Elon Musk thing and sent $730 of BTC from Coinbase. I called Coinbase but no dice in stopping the transaction. Obviously. It's my own stupid, stupid fault. The transaction is pending with 0 confirms. I've read about double-spending (?) the transaction to get it to come back. Is this actually a thing? If so, can someone very gently tell me step by step how I would go about doing it? I'll pay real money to your Paypal if anyone can help me stop this transaction from going through. I cannot believe how stupid I've been.

"Most bitcoin multi millionaires are pedophiles, murderers, rapist, and more somehow worse","Alright let me explain, when bitcoin was really cheap on the dark web there where people killing babies on live stream. According to a guy called daylyt when he was 13 he was on the deep web searching for weapons. Then he thought maybe there is a serum that can make you smart, so he looks stuff up and this page costed 1 bitcoin to enter.

Daily Market Recap - 07/16 - Great Moves on The Crypto,"[https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/bitcoins-and-u-s-dollar-bills-730547\/](https://i.redd.it/jadfgwp6eba11.jpg)

Hello Monday! Crypto land is starting the week right with some great moves across the board. 

 Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $6604, hitting and breaking the resistance at $6450. Bitcoin dominance is down slightly, sitting at 42.5&amp;#37;. Bitcoin looks stronger this morning above $6000.00 and it seems we're targeting to test $7000 soon... again :)

But on the charts, we're very bullish today. MACD is snuggly above the bullish area. The yellow SRSI is turned up and almost hitting 40. The green RSI is also turned up above 80. The Money Flow Index is ranging a bit but is showing some gentle curving up below the overbought area. It’s now clear that in order to spike again, Bitcoin will need to see a larger volume for a recovery.  If it does break up $7000 in the next 48 hours, we might see a bull run to $10000 with minimal resistance on $7750 and $8560.  


Is all this was fueled by [statement of Larry Fink](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-cryptocurrency/blackrock-is-evaluating-cryptocurrencies-ceo-says-idUSKBN1K61MC), CEO of BlackRock Inc.? How do you think?

How could authorities ban Bitcoin without actually banning it?,"Some countries' financial watch dogs had, intentionally or not, issued highly ambiguous official statements, which then led to the situation, when the wast majority of country's institutions, organization and business entities refuse to deal with Bitcoin not because it's unlawful but because it's too scary.

One of those examples are the Kyrgyz Republic ""Bitcoin's ban"".

The state of Bitcoin legality in Kyrgyzstan has been widely misinterpreted by medias. For example, in November 2017 one of the popular Bitcoin-outlets reported the following: ""... Like banning drugs, alcohol, or the Internet, banning Bitcoin sounds nonsensical and unenforceable. Nevertheless, that's exactly the case in five countries: Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, and Nepal. ...""

Nonetheless, it might be that Kyrgyzstan had found itself in this list only because of the ""lost in translation"" trivia. It was all started at July 25, 2014, when the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) published (in English) its lengthy statement named: ""Warning of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic on the spread and use of the ... , in particular, bitcoins (bitcoin)"".

It had became one of the first times when a national bank directly addressed the issue of Bitcoin payments in its official memorandum. Unsurprisingly, this documents has an unmistakable anti-Bitcoin flavor to it. Among other assertions it contains the following: ... At the same time we should not forget that under the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic the sole legal tender on the territory of our country is the national currency of Kyrgyzstan ... . And the use of ... , bitcoins, in particular, as a means of payment in the Kyrgyz Republic will be a violation of the law of our state.

This declaration, taken out of the context, has been then re-published multiple times by various Internet periodicals. However, the same documents also holds this unequivocal statement: ""... National Bank notes that ... (Bitcoin) is not governed by the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic and for today no legal and regulatory framework for the regulation of relations connected with ... (Bitcoin)"".

Obviously, those two assertions can't live together in one official document without causing a major controversy. We, then, can assume that either an unanimous Kyrgyz bureaucrat (s), which was (were) responsible for this ""warning"", did it with the unlawful, conspiratorial purpose to unilaterally bring Bitcoin down, or, which I think is more probable, it's simply the case of the bad translation (funny enough, an original Kyrkyz language version is absent from the NBKR site).

Still, after so many (four) years passed since that contentious memorandum saw the light of the day, it has became very difficult to separate causes from the effects. Today, paradoxically, Kyrgyzstan is ""officially"" the ""Bitcoin-free"" country, at the same time, unofficially, remaining the place, where Bitcoin is not regulated.

Business Notes for Startups Founders in Kyrgyzstan:

political climate: moderately friendly;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: mobile apps, FinTech, e-commerce, tourism;
major limitations: small, low-tech economy, small population with users base, which is largely limited to Bishkek, low per capita (under $1000), aged infrastructure, low Internet penetration rate, brain drainage, an absence of seed and VC financing;
stimulus: GDP growth has started to take off (currently stands at 4%), low tax rates;
opportunities: niche, mobile based e-services.
Bitcoin (outlook): not regulated (negative).

Financial firm I work for changed their tune about bitcoin today,"Late last year when the first one of my clients started asking about diversifying into bitcoin, I sent a message to compliance asking them if we have a policy about offering bitcoin advice, guidance or have a plan to offer buying bitcoin on behalf of clients (many clients cannot even use their phone correctly but they have a lot of money).  

The reply was do not discuss bitcoin at all, not positive, not negative. Tell clients we do not get involved in that. 

Earlier this year I changed firms, and  again I was told not to discuss bitcoin with any clients. 

In the past few months we lost many clients because other firms including very popular trading firms are offering a way for people to invest in bitcoin. I am not referring to coinbase etc. I am referring to mainstream investment firms. Once they got the client for bitcoin they got them to transfer their entire portfolio there, some very large portfolios. 

Today we were told that we will start offering a program to help clients invest in bitcoin, but no details yet. For now we should tell clients it will be out soon. We were also given permission from compliance to reach out to customers who asked (but not to those that did not ask) about bitcoin to let them know. 

The saddest moments in my day is when a client walks in and tells me he wants me to sell off some shares because hes going to get into a ""coin like bitcoin"" aka shitcoin, on the ground floor.

Compliance does not allow us to talk anyone into or out of an investment unless they sign a 50 page waiver that says they won't hold us responsible. For the fund management aspect we have another batch of waivers they sign when they signup.

The next bull run will be less intense than the previous one,"I know this doesn't match the previous patterns, but I think it's true from now on:
We know that the bull run last November was because of a huge influx of cash from people who used to watch from the sidelines before but finally decided to get involved. Although there are no formal studies, my guess is that a lot of those people were college students and middle-class people. Those who are not involved yet are either 1) not techy at all, 2) poor, 3) pessimistic about the technology/whether it's a Ponzi scheme.
The next bull run will attract people of group 3 mostly, and a little of group 1 and 2 (who may borrow to invest). My guess is that the number (and wealth) of these people are smaller than those who entered in the Nov17-Jan18 bull run.

Also, because the prices are higher now, a higher amount of money should flow in to create a bullrun. Again, makes it less likely to happen.

Furthermore, people who entered in the previous bullrun are in red now and will be willing to sell the moment they become slightly green. This creates a huge sell wall and will prevent/slow down the price breaking its previous high.

So in summary, I think for three reasons the next bull run will be mild: 1. most of the retail money is already in the market, 2. since prices are high, more money is required to create a run, 3. many people who bought in the previous run are willing to sell to recoup their losses.",1531761903,16/07/2018 17:25:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zcu73/the_next_bull_run_will_be_less_intense_than_the/,1

I've translated Bitcoin.org into my native language entirely. So happy to do something for the community,"After 2 months of work, I managed to translate Bitcoin.org to my native language - Serbian.

I managed to take over the translation which was not actively maintained (last cordinator activity was 4 years ago) and take it from 5-10% and the last activity from 100% in few weeks.

I know it's not a big deal for most, but it is for me.

I know that there were some contraversial things about bitcoin.org lately, and I am sure some  people will post some comments, but I am just happy that I am able to give back to the community. Bitcoin.org helped me learn and I hope that the translation will help people who speak or understand Serbian (12 million people).

If you speak Serbian feel free to review it, report mistakes and help me improve it.

"If BTC takes over the world, we'll need people like me, because we'll be the majority!","Obviously I'm new to crypto currency, I understand the basics. I know how it works and the main projects.

I know BTC is king, was first to market and has the best shot of if ever, replacing fiat currency eventually.

So I looked into the supply of BTC, 21 million at total capacity. Now 21 million seems scarce now, but imagine if we ever got to a dominant world currency! My point is, that for people who missed super early prices, buying $50 or $100 worth now seems like your wasting money, like your not getting more than a fraction, why bother right?! Most people deal in whole numbers, especially those who are new. 

Well, I'm just doing some sums on total population, and it makes for interesting reading. A fraction is all anyone would need to be considered a decent bag holder of BTC. 

Even holding 0.1 BTC would be a remarkable feat in that situation. 

I guess my point is that it's not too early to start putting $50 a week or a few hundred dollars when available into BTC without feeling like such a small holder. Many people feel this way, yet from my calculations, they would still actually considered early to the party now, if it ends up going where we think it may. 

The majority of people (as stated in my title) will hold little to no BTC because of the scarcity of supply, including me. But..... We'll need people to start realising that owning a very small amount of BTC, and purchasing fractions, to make it mainstream. Because the majority of people will only ever own a fraction. 

I hope by l looking at things this way I'll in-fact end up having a decent holding, even though it'll only be a fraction of a coin, maybe I haven't yet missed out afterall.

Why Bitcoin will Fail but it's Token's Will Succeed.,"[https://www.yours.org/content/why-bitcoin-will-fail-but-it-s-token-s-will-succeed-d0223c6a3e58](https://www.yours.org/content/why-bitcoin-will-fail-but-it-s-token-s-will-succeed-d0223c6a3e58)

Hello everyone, I've been following crypto for along time. There is so much potential in this technology to change the world, however the ideas and concepts of money in every single place I go and read is flawed. Its so flawed that some people don't not see how they are making the same mistakes as their forefathers made.

This i am taking about Bitcoin as money, as a single uniform commodity given its value by its scarcity. Attempting to make Bitcoin a store of value or medium of exchange or both will lead us right back into the fallen state of the gold standard. Which was a failure for the exact same reason, it was money as a single uniform commodity.

For this reason, i felt impelled to shine light on the darkness that plagues Bitcoiners and crypto-economists. Bitcoin can be so much more than this, Bitcoin can be the true bank buster but only through tokenazation. There is a reason Bankers do not fear Bitcoin, that is because it can be easily manipulated to be money as debt.

Please goto and read the article I posted above. If it interests you and appreciate what I have shown, please purchase the article or make a comment on it. I will be replying mostly there. Thank you all.",1531786428,17/07/2018 00:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zgc4d/why_bitcoin_will_fail_but_its_tokens_will_succeed/,1

Affine cipher - Tool to encrypt your mnemonic seed with paper and pencil,"If anyone is familiar with modular arithmetic and finding inverses then an Affine cipher is a simple paper and pencil way to encrypt your seed before putting it in a safe.

Affine ciphers: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine\_cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher)

Some videos on modular arithmetic and finding inverses:

BIP39: [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md)

With BIP39 indexed from 0 to 2047 we can use Affine ciphers the following ways:

To encrypt the word we would use:

E(word) = a\*word + b mod 2048

a and b are the key. It is necessary that gcd(a,2048) = 1 and that b is an integer

To decrypt the word we need to find the inverse of a (say a') and use:

D(word') = a'(word' - b) mod 2048

To give a simple example use a = 1 and b = 3 using the word atom which is indexed at 114

E(atom) = 114 + 3 mod 2048 = 117 mod 2048 = attitude

In this case a' = 1 so,

D(attitude) = 117 - 3 mod 2048 = 114 mod 2048 = atom

Non-trivial example use a = 13 and b = 18 

E(atom) = 13\*114 + 18 mod 2048 = 1500 mod 2048 = rocket

In this case a' = 1733 so,

D(rocket) = 1733(1500 - 18) mod 2048 = 114 mod 2048 = atom

Types of Bitcoin user in 2018 - which are YOU?,"**Type a) The freewheeler**    
After a big rise in Bitcoin value, you cashed out some of your coin and covered your initial investment. This means your remaining coin is free so you can be reckless. Some luxury purchases and risky trades followed. Some have been good, some not so good. You know the chaoss of Bitcoin oh so well.    
    
**Type b) Super Long term HODLer**    
You got in before the summer of 2017. Either you can't remember how to sell your bitcoin, or you don't care about the money you put in. Either way, you're stoked, and feel like you did a real smart thing. You follow the price as a diversion.    
    
**Type c) Short term HODLer**    
You got in before December 2017, and right now your investment is pretty much even. You are a minority - no many people held through the December run and January resurgence.    
    
**Type d) The burned**    
You got in During the December bull run and sold when it went back down below 10k. Sorry bud, hope you didn't lose anything important - consider it an education cost, reflect on lessons learned and move forwards.    
    
**Type e) The unburned**    
You got in during the December bull run and now you're down about 50% but you still haven't sold! You're either rich enough or brave enough to hope for a new All Time High in the future.    
    
**Type f) The big dipper**    
Not new to Bitcoin, you probably also fit into one of the above types too. You know how to set targets and trade regularly. You were smart enough to guess that it would not go much below 6k, and you've been trading for small gains for the last few months.    
     
**Type g) The bedroom enthusiast**    
You dream of one day owning a whole bitcoin. It's going to take years. Meanwhile, you passionately post memetic comments on r/bitcoin    
    
**Type h) The user**    
You don't like to hold Bitcoin because of its volatile nature, but every once in a while you'll convert fiat to Bitcoin (probably using localbitcoins) to do an international money transfer or to make a personal purchase from accommodating vendors. Thanks, sincerely, from us all - it's you that makes this thing work!

Selling bitcoin for cash while abroad,"Hi. I want to sell 0.3 BTC for the local currency. What's my best option? My ideas so far:

- register as a seller at localbitcoin: Pros: Safest option. Cons: there is very few listing of sellers for cash in the whole country. Have to sign up with personnal information. There is a 15% gap between the price listed there and the current exchange price. Might not find someone willing to buy exactly 0.3 bitcoin.

- Hang out near a bitcoin ATM and offer a deal to someone who wants to buy. Pros: efficient way to find people willing to buy bitcoin. Relatively safe. Can sell for the fair rate. Cons: Not sure of the legality. Looks very suspicious! The cashier working there or another person could call the cops on me.

- Go to a bitcoin meetup to find a buyer. Pros: Relatively safe. Can sell for the fair rate. Cons: most groups have rules against sellers.

Qyno Coin Introduces Game Changing Financial Ecosystem.,"Qyno Coin Introduces Game Changing Financial Ecosystem for Instant, Anonymous Cryptocurrency Payments

With global financial systems poised to adopt blockchain technology, Qyno’s unveiling of a low cost, anonymous and instant alternative to Bitcoin couldn’t be more timely+

Qyno Coin has pulled back the curtain on a financial ecosystem that finally affords users a lighting fast, near-zero transaction fee alternative to Bitcoin that is both anonymous and secured by masternodes. The security of Qyno Coin achieved by the use of masternodes has the secondary benefit of being financially rewarding to users who choose to become masternode owners on the Qyno network.

Masternodes on the Qyno blockchain enable next-level validation in ways that standard mining can not. Masternodes are essentially decentralized servers owned by anyone who purchases the collateral amount of Qyno Coin (QNO) and holds them in the Qyno Wallet. These masternodes do two critical pieces of work. First, they allow for the performance of functions like *InstantSend* and *PrivateSend*, both of which are Qyno Coin features allowing for transactions that are confirmed in the blink of an eye and guarantee anonymity for both parties involved. Second, Qyno masternodes secure the network because they agree on transactions by consensus. The work performed by Qyno masternodes is rewarded with a massive 90% block reward, the highest of any masternode coin in the crypto market.

The Qyno blockchain uses a Neoscrypt hashing algorithm which is so cryptographically secure that it is ASIC resistant and has the secondary benefit of being less memory intensive than usual hashing algorithms. Because Qyno is a Neoscrypt based coin, it is easier for a person with normal computing power to participate in mining it. Due to properties which keep Qyno Coin transactions fast, secure and near-zero cost, the Qyno financial ecosystem makes a perfect host for eCommerce solutions.

“With anonymous, nearly zero-cost transactions allowing merchants to do business in a secure and instant fashion, the Qyno platform enables the next generation of eCommerce on the blockchain. Using an industry-leading masternode model to secure the Qyno platform means merchants will never have to worry about the safety of traded assets,” said the Qyno team in a recent statement.

Merchants thinking of integrating Qyno into their eCommerce environment will have a major incentive to do so. Qyno’s merchant gateway, called Q-PayGate, allows for any tool, product, or merchant service to be seamlessly integrated into the Qyno blockchain. Merchants who accept Qyno payments using the Q-PayGate plugin will be able to host their own Qyno masternodes using the generated funds, creating a stream of revenue as they profit from both their business income and the ROI generated by owning Qyno masternodes.

Watch mining rewards – and miners,"*A recent article suggested that mining rewards could form an early warning signal for market action:* [https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/06/26/bitcoin-watch-out-below/#58046c0363a2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/06/26/bitcoin-watch-out-below/#58046c0363a2).

The   author writes, ‘I look at the rewards for the powerful 1080ti  Nvidia   card to get my guide. Right now it has fallen off the charts. A  few   weeks back and the card would excavate $3.50 of bitcoin-equivalent    altcoins but right now you are lucky to dig $1.50. This is a flashing    warning to me as the drop in mining rewards has been faster than the    drop in bitcoin’s dollar price and is at the lowest end of the range in    the last year. Bitcoin is on the ledge of another heavy fall that I am    expecting this summer to bring the price down to a low from where it    bottoms.’

There is a long and tortuous   debate about the relationship between  hashrate and price, but this   analysis suggests that falling mining  rewards are a red flag for   further drops. In one sense that’s  understandable, since new hashrate   will lag price action – simply,  miners who order new hardware as they   see bitcoin spiking have to wait a  while before it ships. Hashrate will   continue to rise even after a  price peak. So this article might  simply  be noting the fact that  hashrate and price follow each other,  just out  of sync by a few weeks.

But  miners do  far more than maintain the network. As some of the most   active members  of the bitcoin ecosystem, they have a keen interest in   bitcoin’s price.  As Waves CEO Sasha Ivanov recently wrote on Telegram,   ‘People who ask  the eternal question “what are cryptocurrencies backed   with” don’t  realize that they are backed better than many national   currencies. If  it were not for the miners BTC could go down to sub 1000   levels right  now, now we’re in the same situation that was in Spring   2015, when  mining was just on the verge of profitability, and  basically  it was  miners who did not allow BTC price go lower. So god  bless the  miners,  despite I’m sure we won’t see any hardware based  mining in 5-10  years.’

Miners  control  crypto supply in more ways than one. They create  coins, but  they also  decide whether coins hit exchanges. They are the  decentral  bank of  bitcoin – and they play an important role in setting  the price  of BTC.

Qyno - Trading Made Easy on the Blockchain,"From the outset, the pillar of the Qyno project will be the Qyno coin, a utility coin with two aims. First, the Qyno coin will function as a stable asset enabling the development of the project's ecosystem. Second, the Qyno coin will reward masternode operators with industry-leading ROI, as masternode operators will earn a generous passive income due to a staggering 90% block reward. The purpose of such a mammoth block reward is to create a very high incentive for masternode operators working to secure the network.



The Qyno coin's stability will allow users to engage the Qyno financial system easily. Without major fluctuations in price affecting the net cost of users looking to enter and use the Qyno financial system, adoption of the system will happen quickly and globally. The entry into and use of blockchain-based financial systems tend to be prohibitive, due in part to the fact that the utility coins associated with those financial systems fluctuate wildly in value, making cost analysis for users looking to enter the system difficult to calculate.



The Core of the Qyno Financial Ecosystem Q-Paygate Apps and eCommerce Solutions
Users adopting Qyno will find the timely deployment and integration of Q-PayGate, the payment gateway milestone at the core of the Qyno financial ecosystem. With Q-PayGate any tool, product, or merchant service can be seamlessly integrated with the blockchain, allowing users a time-saving, streamlined experience that delivers unmatched functionality. Developing and implementing payment plugins for any eCommerce platform, such as industry giants WooCommerce, is part of the Q-Paygate mission.



The plugins developed as part of the Q-Paygate engine will differ from traditional eCommerce plugins in that they will, notably, generate extra income for merchants accepting Qyno payments. For merchants the implications of the Qyno income-generating plugins will be staggering: Merchants with a high amount of traffic and sales will be able to use those funds to run a masternode. Masternodes generate a 90% block reward, provide merchants with a large extra income for adopting the Qyno platform, while at the same time providing additional network stability.
The Qyno foundation will fund the creation and additional development of plugins from an allocation entitled strictly to product development, leading to contented and very well supported developers who in turn provide the Qyno financial ecosystem with unparalleled product development.



Blockchain Made Simple
When compared to the total amount of people worldwide using traditional forms of money such as Euro, Yen, and American Dollars, the use and spread of cryptocurrency appears very small. That is owing in part to the relative infancy of the cryptocurrency world, but if crypto is to see adoption on the scale necessary to compete with traditional forms of money both physical and digital, then blockchain-based financial platforms need to have, as their primary quality, ease of use for the most amount of people worldwide. Only then will the crypto world see the adoption necessary for blockchain to fulfill its revolutionary potential.



Qyno financial ecosystem has, at the core of its mission, the adoption of worldwide users in mind and as such has created a platform for the people. Access to Qyno is global, painless, and offers financial mobility unlike other platforms past or present. Bank account withdrawals and deposits are core functions of the Qyno ecosystem, and ease of these two functions are blended into every Qyno tool available.


Because bank deposits are a key factor in financial access globally, the Qyno development team has studied and developed a proof of concept relating to integrating this functionality into the Qyno blockchain with excellent results. Qyno bank deposits are being enabled to function with different accounts such as checking, savings, time deposit, and call deposit accounts.
Financial Products on the Blockchain
Traditional financial systems are more than just payment solutions; they're entire ecosystems aimed at capturing all of the financial activity present in society. The difference between traditional and blockchain based financial systems is that traditional, or centralized systems, rely on third parties for processing data and require high financial upkeep for executives, presidents, and trustees. 


Decentralized, blockchain based solutions such as Qyno are able to capture the same financial ecosystem without any of the costs associated with third parties, CEO's, or brick and mortar locations. Because of this, Qyno is able to offer users and merchants alike eCommerce solutions at fractions of the traditional costs.



Qyno Foundation
The Qyno team is concurrently developing functionalities in addition to current milestones as part of the Qyno foundation protocol. The allocation of development resources to research means the Qyno team is perpetually refining and advancing its product for the ease and adoption of users worldwide.

Do people really need to understand Bitcoin?,"I'm at work and bored af and I just thought of something which may not make any sense at all.

Alot of people tell me that the reason people do not want anything to do with crypto is because they don't know how it works. In my opinion this argument seems a bit flawed. Although I know what they mean (people are vary of their money) I think that it don't make sense. 

I mean, at the end of the day not many people fully understand how FIAT money, VISA and banks works. They just have an idea about how it works. Yet, for some reason, everyone seems willing to use banks, credit cards etc. Should this not mean that as soon as the user experience is improved for Bitcoin, making it easier to use, people will stop asking questions about what Bitcoin is (How many people ask themselves what money is on an average?).

Also a question for people, what do you think biggest obstacle for mass adoption of Bitcoin is? (Mass adoption =/= replacing the dollar).",1531827286,17/07/2018 11:34:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zkcv7/do_people_really_need_to_understand_bitcoin/,1

Daily market recap - 07/17 - BTC Gaining Ground at $6700,"[https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/bitcoins-and-u-s-dollar-bills-730547\/](https://i.redd.it/qfdv3q6p5ia11.jpg)

Perhaps due to some more positive news, the market is starting to feel like it is beginning to step up again. Having defended $6,000 last week, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be building momentum for a price rise.

Several technical analysis experts have done a good job of analyzing the general direction of the price of Bitcoin in the coming months. But it seems that the news announcements with regard to institutional money appeared poised to flow into the cryptocurrency market has had a positive effect on the sentiment of the markets.

Bitcoin is surging higher today and all the coins from the top 10 coins by 24-hour volume posted a positive change, ranging from 1.7% to 8.5%. The market capitalization has risen to 270.8 Billion and 24 hour volume at 14.6 Billion.

Yesterday the price rose up from $6300 and broke a key barrier. Then it surged above the $6380 and $6600 resistance levels. After hitting the resistance, it went for $6700. Bitcoin (BTC) has now been consolidating on the $6700 level and trending upwards with supports near $6600 and $6540 on the downside. On the upside, a break above the $6750 high could set the path for a move towards $7000.

If there is a downside movement today, the price may get stuck at the $6600 support.

Looking at the 4 hour chart, the MACD is getting upside to the bullish zone. The yellow SRSI is turned up and above 80. The green RSI is turned up and beautifully snug above 50. Money Flow Index is also turning up and correcting from the overbought levels.

That doesn’t make them illegitimate or anything, they have many “followers” on Twitter but the accounts could be fake due to the lack of likes, retweets, and commentary.

Anyone visit or follow them at all?

Social media attacks on the Lightning Network,"Recently there have been a lot of social media attacks against the Lightning Network.

What I find surprising is that there are actually a whole lot of legitimate technical criticisms about the LN.  However, rather than these critics engaging in logical and rational discussions about real technical concerns, they have resorted to blatant lying.

Personally, I haven't decided yet if they are saying the things they are because they are just plain idiots, or they are intentionally spreading bald faced lies.

Examples of some of the lies being spread:

* LN transactions are not bitcoin transactions
* LN is a different token
* You can only use LN under custodial control
* LN isn't decentralized

The most absurd thing I have read is some moron on Twitter who goes by the handle 'Deadal Nix' (@deadalnix) posted the following:  *""Lightning tokens are not bitcoin""*

Either this guy is a complete moron, or he is intentionally and willfully spreading lies.  I think it's probably a combination of both.

There is no such thing as a 'LN token'.  All money transferred on the LN is in hash-time-locked smart contracts representing a confirmed amount of bitcoin on the blockchain.  It's important to note that the LN can work with more than one blockchain.  So you can, in theory, use the LN with litecoin and some other tokens as well.

Currently the focus is that the LN will be primarily for bitcoin but, in the future, it will inter-operate with litecoin and quite likely tokens representing any number of assets.

I find it surprising that the big-block camp is attacking the LN.  They now have a network which can support up to 32mb blocks, and it's a complete ghost town.  No one is using it.  You would think they would focus on that.  Frankly, I'm shocked they haven't spammed their own network with false volume to create the illusion of real world usage.  No one cares enough to even do that.

I did want to take a moment this morning to address a specific criticism which is being pushed by big-blocker Peter R. Rizun.

He seems to feel he has discovered a critical problem with the LN because you have to be online to receive a payment.

He then extrapolates from this that all LN users will be required to use custodial accounts, because that's the only way they can be guaranteed to be able to receive payments.  He then concludes that makes LN useless and it sucks, game over.

I would like to address this specific point.

First of all, today, most people use 3rd party custodial accounts.  They don't have to. They choose to.  If you take the population of everyone who claims to 'own cryptocurrency' only a small percentage actually directly control all of their private keys.  This is especially true with most alt-coins.  People leave their tokens on exchanges or with Coinbase.  They don't have to.  They have been told only a thousand times that not your keys, not your tokens, but they do it anyway; either as a matter of convenience or because they are afraid to provide their own security.

That is their choice.  They don't have to.  Just as someone using the LN *can* run a full node if they want.  If they choose to use a custodial account on Coinbase and then, under the hood, Coinbase uses LN, that would be fine too.

All that said, Peter's objection still doesn't hold up under scrutiny.

He is correct in stating that to receive a LN payment you must be online to do so.  This is because a LN transaction requires all parties to exchange signatures;  by signing the multi-sig transaction representing the smart contract.

However..here's the thing..

Most people are already connected to the Internet all of the time anyway, via their cell phone.

So, I'm not sure why this is perceived as some sort of deal breaker.  If someone wants to send you some money, is it really that big a deal to have your cellphone connected to the Internet?

Probably not.

However..let's say someone wants to send you some money, but you are not online at the time.

Why is this an issue?

The person who wants to send you money can simply register for a notification event the next time you are online, and send the transaction then.

To be clear, there are a lot of questions still about the LN.  It isn't some magic silver bullet scaling solution.

It does not solve all problems.

It also has a complex security model which has not yet stood the test of time and attack.

However, it is certainly useful.  It's even useful today.  Especially for low value transactions.

So, please be aware and watch out for the attacks on the LN.  It's worse than what we have seen in the past in terms of attacks on  segwit (remember, 'segwit coins', 'anyone can spend', etc. etc.)

The fact that big blockers are realizing that literally no one wants to use their network shows they are panicking. 

Stay frosty out there.

Compared to its all-time-high value of almost $20,000 (equivalent to around 1 million PHP), the current price is quite low. With the general exchange rule of buying low and selling high, there might be a good amount of money to be made for keen investors.

Anyone else interested on trying my Bitcoin app?,"Quick use case examples.

**Find an item** (i.e., a dress) that you may have seen in a magazine or on a website (such as Pinterest or Instagram). If you don’t know where to buy online, you can upload a photo and ask other **Bitfortip** members to search for it online to win a  bitcoin reward. UI is like Instagram so it's pretty easy to use. 

**Find a better prices** By offering a small Bitcoin reward for members to search for you, you increase your probability of finding that item at a lower cost.

**Find a piece of information** on the internet that you may not know about. Post an inquiry along with a Bitcoin reward for people to find you a certain link, image, etc.


**Once you create an account**	 a bitcoin address is generated where you can then deposit some funds to post an inquiry on the platform. Minimum amount required is 0.0001 BTC roughly 10 cents.

If anyone wants to try it, send me a pm with your **username and what would you like to find, so I can give you some test funds**

"My bitcoin prediction, take it or leave it :)","The price of bitcoin is not like the price of a company's stock, or the value of a currency, or even the price of gold. A company's true value changes in relation to its surrounding industry sector, the performance of its sales of a product, or the changing of management. There is no technical difference between the Euro and the Dollar. More gold can even be produced by investing in mining the Earth's crust for more gold.

Bitcoin is technically unique. It is the first, most battle-tested, most secure, and largest, decentralised currency. And unlike gold, or any other commodity, there is an absolute hard limit of 21m bitcoin that can ever be produced. Pretty much any other object in the world can be produced more of, by investing time and human labour to produce it. There are techniques to producing arable land from desert; sea water can be desalinated to make it drinkable; asteroids can be mined for gold - it's not easy, but it's all technically possible. But no matter what we do, we will never produce more than 21m bitcoin. This leads to the conclusion that bitcoin is the first truly scarce store of value (Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard).

Coupled with the utility that bitcoin can also be used as a near-instant digital payment system, this has led to valuations of bitcoin, based purely on its utility, of over $1 million. For example, [one research paper](https://www.scribd.com/document/354688866/Bitcoin-A-5-8-Million-Valuation-Crypto-Currency-and-A-New-Era-of-Human-Cooperation) valued each bitcoin as $5.8 million. [This other valuation (page 1 of 7)](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133818-bitcoin-valuation-4-million) puts it at $4 million. Many others have valued one bitcoin as over a million dollars, taking into account the current size of the gold market, current size of the broad money supply, etc. Bitcoin is technically superior to them all, due to the elimination of trust, and the absolute scarcity. Bitcoin and even the crypto market in general is still [extremely small](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcHBAQaGjez1R26AG6Mrshz74cU1sxTtvCpajABoNeLcE/all-the-worlds-money-and-markets-dv.png).

I believe the price movements seen thus far are bitcoin breaking through dollar price barriers, on the way to its eventual multi-million dollar valuation. There are four major notions to bear in mind:

1. The only factors that influence the price of an object are the true value of it (i.e. how useful it is to humans), and how valuable humans think it is. In other words, the object itself, and the humans that buy/sell it.

2. The technical usefulness of bitcoin hasn't changed (it has, in fact, improved).

3. Since the invention of bitcoin, the human mind has not changed.

4. Due to psychology, immediate price movements of a product influence a human's perception of the value of the product, i.e. regardless of the usefulness of the product itself, if the price is going down, an average human is more likely to sell, if the price is going up, a human is more likely to buy.

For example, if I told you about a company who's shares have gone from under $2000 dollars, to $7000 in a year, that's over 250% yield in a year, which you'd no doubt agree is a stellar investment. But I've just described bitcoin's yield in the last year. People forget that fact, because when they see the chart, they see [this](https://i.imgur.com/VBD3cry.png).

If you were trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin in July 2013, you would be looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/R3aKpiI).

Trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin today, you're looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/eAW89zP).

The similarity is striking. Based on the notions I've just stated, I believe that the pattern of what has already happened will essentially happen again. The conventional mantra of ""past trends do not guarantee future performance"" is a platitude that investment companies need to tell people when they try and guess stock price movements. Bitcoin is not the same, and the phrase does not apply. Bitcoin is a new commodity. Everything is the same as it was in July 2013 - the product is the same and the humans are the same. Except for one crucial factor. Bitcoin's price is now of the order of $1000 instead of $100. The price movements are becoming ""slower"", i.e. the graph is becoming more ""stretched"", because bitcoin is closer to its true valuation in July 2018 than it was in July 2013. It's a curve approaching a true value - see [this log graph](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXOUJwiVQAAg0R-.jpg:large) of the entire price history and you'll see it's actually becoming less volatile overall.

In terms of the many ""crashes"" that the price has gone through, I believe that this is down to human psychology. Again, nothing changed about the technical utility of bitcoin to force people to sell. There was no CEO fired, no technical fault that was discovered about the blockchain, there was no product released that was a big flop. Bitcoin remained the same. Indeed, the biggest external shock to bitcoin has been the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, which was handling a staggering 70% of bitcoin trades before it went bankrupt in February 2014. What did this do to the price? [It was hit, but not as much as it was hit at the end of 2013](https://i.imgur.com/BdPSwQz.png).

So what happened at the end of 2013? It was the first time bitcoin was priced at over $1000.

Powers of ten, especially powers of ten of the dollar, which is the most common currency of bitcoin trades, matter hugely. Imagine living in a world where bitcoin had only been worth tens of dollars, then suddenly it's over a hundred dollars. It looks expensive, so you sell. Why do shops sell things at $9.99? Because $10.00 looks expensive. Why do people say ""you look a million dollars""? Why not ""you look nine hundred grand""? If you told someone ""you look nine million dollars"", they'd ask, ""why not ten million dollars""? People think in terms of top tens, centuries, millennia. There's a TV show called Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, where the top prize is exactly $1,000,000. If the top prize was $999,999 it would be frustrating. If it was $1,245,379 it would be arbitrary and weird.

Human psychology of the power of ten is the only reason for bitcoin's major crashes. If you look at the [all-time log graph, overlaid with dollar powers of ten](https://i.imgur.com/CC25CON.png), you'll notice that every single time bitcoin breached a dollar power of ten, it looked expensive, so people generally stopped buying and started selling. It's that simple. Obviously the pattern won't be perfect - sometimes a whale will come in and force the price to well over a power of ten before it crashes back down. But the fact is that every time it breaches a power of ten, it looks expensive, so it will be sold until it drops below that power of ten.

What about non-dollar power of tens? In April, a strange price movement happened which looked like a mini-crash, yet it wasn't associated with a dollar price mark. You'll probably be able to identify the price movement [here](https://i.imgur.com/KUcRToF.png). It just so happens that [this mini-crash happened at the 1 million Yen mark](https://i.imgur.com/DgPS7Zn.png). It was the first time it had crossed that value in over a month - Japanese buyers must have seen this, then piled in. It looked expensive to the holders, so they sold. The effect is reduced in scale because the Yen isn't used as much as the dollar - but the effect is the same.

Looking at 2013's crash - the time from breaking through the dollar power of ten barrier and the low point was 3 months. 5 months after that, it had breached the next power of ten, before enduring a longer selling period (the longer selling period is because of people's reluctance to sell something that has just broken through 2 powers of ten. People look at linear graphs, not log graphs). Comparing to the crash we've just gone through, and assuming that we're recovering from the low point now (as it looks like we are), it was around 6-7 months from the power of ten mark and the low point (around twice as long as in 2013). [See comparison](https://i.imgur.com/AZ2qowl.png). Assuming the pattern roughly repeats, I estimate that around July-August 2019, bitcoin will be valued at $100,000. It will peak just above that, then endure another very long selling period of several years (McAffee will (un)fortunately have to eat his own penis), where it will reach a low of around $20,000 to $30,000. The cycle will then repeat again, but even slower - it will climb and eventually break through the million dollar barrier, crash below, then climb possibly to the ten million dollar mark, where it will very slowly fall below and settle at its true value of 4-5 million dollars, per the valuations above.",1531865244,17/07/2018 22:07:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zpm0y/my_bitcoin_prediction_take_it_or_leave_it/,1

We just released UDAX - the definitive unofficial app for Coinbase Pro on iOS and Android. Let us know what you think!,"Hey /r/Bitcoin

We just released [UDAX](https://www.udax.app/) today for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/udax/id1383462393?ls=1&amp;mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udax), which we are aiming to make the standard mobile app for Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX). We’d love to get your feedback, feature requests, criticism, etc.

As Coinbase / GDAX users, we were really frustrated by the experience of using the exchange on mobile. As a small development team that’s worked extensively with their services before, we decided to treat that frustration as an opportunity after we decided to move on from another one of our projects, and we are really excited about the result.

We think UDAX is a huge step up in terms of interface and user experience for Coinbase Pro on mobile, and has the full array of features that you would hope for and expect like wallet management, depositing and withdrawing via QR code, transfers to and from Coinbase accounts, all order types, professional charting, live order books and more. One you authorize your account with API keys, they are kept securely on your device and never seen by anyone other than Coinbase and only ever over an encrypted connection. We collect absolutely no data about you, just some crash reporting so we can make sure the app is performing as expected.

I’m x-posting this to a few places where I think it might be relevant to people — I hope it doesn’t seem like spamming. We’re just a couple of developers who have been working really hard on this and are excited for people to get their hands on it.

UDAX is $2.99 in both the App Store and the Play Store starting today.

"Dont dismiss the reality of ""digital scarcity"".","When bitcoin reaches $300,000 per bitcoin (not if, when) the market cap of bitcoin will be worth more than all of the gold ever mined. Around $7.5 trillion dollars.

It must hurt so bad to be a gold bug, and sit there watching bitcoin go from zero to worth more than all gold ever mined all while you are hoping and praying that gold can achieve a 10x price rise total if your lucky, and thats in a financial armageddon crisis scenario.

If your still a devout gold bug now and dont even own one satoshi what are you doing with your life.

Think about it. A shiny yellow rock, or a software protocol so advanced in its initial design it has solved previously unsolvable computer science problems, and has the potential to take the value all of the worlds central banks, commercial banks, money transfer services, forex trading market and credit card companies and squeeze that value into a software protocol.

If you dont understand the concept of digital scarcity by now then you probably never will. But ignoring and dismissing it wont make the reality of digital scarcity uninvent itself.

Hopium Time and My Bitcoin Bet,"Hello!  Some of you may know me from the Daily Discussion thread here.   I am an enthusiastic supporter of Bitcoin and also the author of **Hopium Time** (formerly Daily Hopium).  Hopium Time is my effort to improve morale of the Bitcoin community during the dark times of current bear market we've been enduring.  In my posts I make an effort to post good news and show parallels to previous Bitcoin bear markets to provide perspective when things look bleak.

\&amp;nbsp;

I also like to make predictions.  My core prediction is as follows:

**The price of ONE BITCOIN will surpass $100,000 USD before May 1, 2021.**

\&amp;nbsp;

To illustrate my conviction on this prediction and to help my favorite charity, [The Independence Fund](http://www.independencefund.org), I have made it into a [Bet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z9cx2/daily_discussion_july_16_2018/e2iiems).  Please take a look at [my post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z9cx2/daily_discussion_july_16_2018/e2iiems)on this.  I would really like this to grow into a nice donation to the charity which is very helpful to Veterans and their families.  Hopefully some of you guys will pledge to match my Bet.

\&amp;nbsp;

I will attempt to contact some of the leading Bitcoin bulls in the media (John McAfee, Tom Lee, Tim Draper etc.) and let you know in this thread if they plan to participate in my Bet or not.  So you may want to check back on this thread from time to time for a status update.

\&amp;nbsp;

I will maintain an archive of all my **Hopium Time** posts here, in case you are feeling a little down and need a quick reality check or pick-me-up.  See below.

Guys come on. It took me two minutes. Let’s get this ETF approved. There are nearly 1 Million If us and yet there are a mere 90 comments. If you care about bitcoin’s development please leave a comment. Simple how-to guide in this post,"Guys, this is a very important step for bitcoin/cryptocurrency. We all want growth, are you willing to spend two minutes of your time to help do something big? If not for the tech at least do it so your holdings go up in value :-p

For those of you who don’t want to read to figure it out, follow these steps: 

Send an email to:
rule-comments@sec.gov

Paste this into the subject line: 
Release No. 34-83520; File No. SR-CboeBZX-2018-040

Send a basic or wordy email about why you think bitcoin/cryptocurrency/Blockchain tech is good for the world. At the very least say, “Please approve this ETF because i believe bitcoin is an important creation and needs to have the chance to grow” or something like that, please don’t quote that verbatim.

Here is a really great comment to model yours off of if you want more things to say:

A gentle reminder we still have 677 days until the next halving,"[The next](http://www.thehalvening.com/) block subsidy halving doesn’t happen for another (approx) 677 days. 
This means there will still be 1800 new coins produced per day between now and then. 
Whatever method you’re using to calculate your price predictions, be sure you’re factoring in the fact that at $7k per coin, the market has to absorb $12.6million USD per day (through purchases or via miners hodling) between now and the next halving. 
Whatever the sentiment from those who currently hold bitcoin, we still have to endure the fundamental reality that the mining difficulty is still increasing, reducing mining profitability, meaning a greater % of mined coins needs to be sold to cover mining costs, putting downward pressure on the BTC price. 

But also remember that in 34 years there will only be 3.5 new coins produced per day, (approx 0.02 BTC per block); tiny compared to today’s rate. ",1531878944,18/07/2018 01:55:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zrb32/a_gentle_reminder_we_still_have_677_days_until/,1

"Does anybody else get annoyed when people call it a ""coin""?","Maybe I'm just anal, but I don't like how so many people use the words ""coin"" or ""coins"" to describe the units of value. For example, I once bought some Bitcoin off Coinmama, and after a talk with a rep to resolve an issue, she said, ""Okay, I will send you your coins shortly."" I was like, ""You're gonna send me coins? Really? What kind, Walking Liberties?"" 

The Wikipedia definition of ""coin"" is as follows: 'A coin is a small, flat, (usually) round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender.' Well, Bitcoin doesn't fit that description. 

The more appropriate thing to say would have been ""Okay, I'll send you your bitcoin shortly"", because the word ""bitcoin"" can be used to describe both the software and the units of value, regardless of the amount.

Support Bitcoin Bech32 Address,"**What is Bech32?**

It's a new bitcoin address format. Legacy bitcoin addresses start with 1, segwit addresses start with 3, and this new type starts with bc1...

**Benefits**

A typical transaction of one input, two outputs is 226 bytes legacy, 166 vbytes P2SH-P2WPKH segwit (27% less), 141 vbytes pure bech32 P2WPKH segwit (38% less).

If you have many inputs, the savings are larger (and less for many outputs). For 10 input, 1 output legacy is 1515 bytes, 953 vbytes P2SH-P2WPKH (37% less), and 722 vbytes P2WPKH (52% less).

Multisignature transactions benefit even more. Multiinput 2 of 3 multisignature transactions in bech32 P2WPKH segwit are 75% smaller.

These wallets support it:

What would happen if all Lightning channels were closed at once?,"According to [this](https://rompert.com/recksplorer/) there are 7000 Lightning channels currently open. What would happen if they were all closed at the same time? Would the blockchain be overwhelmed and collapse?

It's my understanding that closing a channel generates one on-chain transactions, and that transaction only has one input (regardless of the number of payments the channel received). A small transaction.

Each bitcoin block can handle well over 5000 small transactions. You can see where this is going…

At the moment average blocksize is under 1.0 MB, full blocks average around 1.2MB, leaving 0.2MB typically free. So our 7000 channel closing transactions would most likely get done in well under a dozen blocks - a couple of hours.

Any idea that Andreas Brekken closing his couple of hundred channels would cause a blockchain meltdown is put firmly into perspective.

Predicting the price of bitcoin,"The price of bitcoin is not like the price of a company's stock, or the value of a currency, or even the price of gold. A company's true value changes in relation to its surrounding industry sector, the performance of its sales of a product, or the changing of management. There is no technical difference between the Euro and the Dollar. More gold can even be produced by investing in mining the Earth's crust for more gold.

Bitcoin is technically unique. It is the first, most battle-tested, most secure, and largest, decentralised currency. And unlike gold, or any other commodity, there is an absolute hard limit of 21m bitcoin that can ever be produced. Pretty much any other object in the world can be produced more of, by investing time and human labour to produce it. There are techniques to producing arable land from desert; sea water can be desalinated to make it drinkable; asteroids can be mined for gold - it's not easy, but it's all technically possible. But no matter what we do, we will never produce more than 21m bitcoin. This leads to the conclusion that bitcoin is the first truly scarce store of value (Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard).

Coupled with the utility that bitcoin can also be used as a near-instant digital payment system, this has led to valuations of bitcoin, based purely on its utility, of over $1 million. For example, [one research paper](https://www.scribd.com/document/354688866/Bitcoin-A-5-8-Million-Valuation-Crypto-Currency-and-A-New-Era-of-Human-Cooperation) valued each bitcoin as $5.8 million. [This other valuation (page 1 of 7)](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133818-bitcoin-valuation-4-million) puts it at $4 million. Many others have valued one bitcoin as over a million dollars, taking into account the current size of the gold market, current size of the broad money supply, etc. Bitcoin is technically superior to them all, due to the elimination of trust, and the absolute scarcity. Bitcoin and even the crypto market in general is still [extremely small](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcHBAQaGjez1R26AG6Mrshz74cU1sxTtvCpajABoNeLcE/all-the-worlds-money-and-markets-dv.png).

I believe the price movements seen thus far are bitcoin breaking through dollar price barriers, on the way to its eventual multi-million dollar valuation. There are four major notions to bear in mind:

1. The only factors that influence the price of an object are the true value of it (i.e. how useful it is to humans), and how valuable humans think it is. In other words, the object itself, and the humans that buy/sell it.

2. The technical usefulness of bitcoin hasn't changed (it has, in fact, improved).

3. Since the invention of bitcoin, the human mind has not changed.

4. Due to psychology, immediate price movements of a product influence a human's perception of the value of the product, i.e. regardless of the usefulness of the product itself, if the price is going down, an average human is more likely to sell, if the price is going up, a human is more likely to buy.

For example, if I told you about a company who's shares have gone from under $2000 dollars, to $7000 in a year, that's over 250% yield in a year, which you'd no doubt agree is a stellar investment. But I've just described bitcoin's yield in the last year. People forget that fact, because when they see the chart, they see [this](https://i.imgur.com/VBD3cry.png).

If you were trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin in July 2013, you would be looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/R3aKpiI).

Trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin today, you're looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/eAW89zP).

The similarity is striking. Based on the notions I've just stated, I believe that the pattern of what has already happened will essentially happen again. The conventional mantra of ""past trends do not guarantee future performance"" is a platitude that investment companies need to tell people when they try and guess stock price movements. Bitcoin is not the same, and the phrase does not apply. Bitcoin is a new commodity. Everything is the same as it was in July 2013 - the product is the same and the humans are the same. Except for one crucial factor. Bitcoin's price is now of the order of $1000 instead of $100. The price movements are becoming ""slower"", i.e. the graph is becoming more ""stretched"", because bitcoin is closer to its true valuation in July 2018 than it was in July 2013. It's a curve approaching a true value - see [this log graph](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXOUJwiVQAAg0R-.jpg:large) of the entire price history and you'll see it's actually becoming less volatile overall.

In terms of the many ""crashes"" that the price has gone through, I believe that this is down to human psychology. Again, nothing changed about the technical utility of bitcoin to force people to sell. There was no CEO fired, no technical fault that was discovered about the blockchain, there was no product released that was a big flop. Bitcoin remained the same. Indeed, the biggest external shock to bitcoin has been the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, which was handling a staggering 70% of bitcoin trades before it went bankrupt in February 2014. What did this do to the price? [It was hit, but not as much as it was hit at the end of 2013](https://i.imgur.com/BdPSwQz.png).

So what happened at the end of 2013? It was the first time bitcoin was priced at over $1000.

Powers of ten, especially powers of ten of the dollar, which is the most common currency of bitcoin trades, matter hugely. Imagine living in a world where bitcoin had only been worth tens of dollars, then suddenly it's over a hundred dollars. It looks expensive, so you sell. Why do shops sell things at $9.99? Because $10.00 looks expensive. Why do people say ""you look a million dollars""? Why not ""you look nine hundred grand""? If you told someone ""you look nine million dollars"", they'd ask, ""why not ten million dollars""? People think in terms of top tens, centuries, millennia. There's a TV show called Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, where the top prize is exactly $1,000,000. If the top prize was $999,999 it would be frustrating. If it was $1,245,379 it would be arbitrary and weird.

Human psychology of the power of ten is the only reason for bitcoin's major crashes. If you look at the [all-time log graph, overlaid with dollar powers of ten](https://i.imgur.com/CC25CON.png), you'll notice that every single time bitcoin breached a dollar power of ten, it looked expensive, so people generally stopped buying and started selling. It's that simple. Obviously the pattern won't be perfect - sometimes a whale will come in and force the price to well over a power of ten before it crashes back down. But the fact is that every time it breaches a power of ten, it looks expensive, so it will be sold until it drops below that power of ten.

What about non-dollar power of tens? In April, a strange price movement happened which looked like a mini-crash, yet it wasn't associated with a dollar price mark. You'll probably be able to identify the price movement [here](https://i.imgur.com/KUcRToF.png). It just so happens that [this mini-crash happened at the 1 million Yen mark](https://i.imgur.com/DgPS7Zn.png). It was the first time it had crossed that value in over a month - Japanese buyers must have seen this, then piled in. It looked expensive to the holders, so they sold. The effect is reduced in scale because the Yen isn't used as much as the dollar - but the effect is the same.

Looking at 2013's crash - the time from breaking through the dollar power of ten barrier and the low point was 3 months. 5 months after that, it had breached the next power of ten, before enduring a longer selling period (the longer selling period is because of people's reluctance to sell something that has just broken through 2 powers of ten. People look at linear graphs, not log graphs). Comparing to the crash we've just gone through, and assuming that we're recovering from the low point now (as it looks like we are), it was around 6-7 months from the power of ten mark and the low point (around twice as long as in 2013). [See comparison](https://i.imgur.com/AZ2qowl.png). Assuming the pattern roughly repeats, I estimate that around July-August 2019, bitcoin will be valued at $100,000. It will peak just above that, then endure another very long selling period of several years (McAffee will (un)fortunately have to eat his own penis), where it will reach a low of around $20,000 to $30,000. The cycle will then repeat again, but even slower - it will climb and eventually break through the million dollar barrier, crash below, then climb possibly to the ten million dollar mark, where it will very slowly fall below and settle at its true value of 4-5 million dollars, per the valuations above.",1531899841,18/07/2018 07:44:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ztezj/predicting_the_price_of_bitcoin/,1

SBS Bank Keeping Eyes on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain,"According to the Southland Times, SBS bank in New Zealand is keeping a watching brief on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as it looks to future banking trends on behalf of its customers. 

The potential use of digital banking technology was one just one of the several questions put to SBS chief executive Shaun Drylie at the SBS annual meeting at the Kelvin Hotel.  

Drylie recogonized there was real value in blockchain as a technology: ""We think, and the common consensus is, that it has real merit. Cryptocurrencies, we're not to sure, and if you look at the volatility of cryptocurrencies that would suggest the market is not too sure as well."" 

Drylie thought cryptocurrencies would have their place, but the regulation around them was still fairly unsure. 

""We're keeping a close eye on it, but it's very hard to pick where it's going to go long term.""

Advice needed about Bitcoin / Blockchain due to 30 Bitcoin loss from JAXX Wallet Glitch,"I just need a confirmation from this public forum that the xPub key which is generated by the IanColeman bip39 tool when you enter the passphrase is the ""master public key"" and will display the complete balance of all the public bitcoin addresses found in that wallet. 

My conclusion from what I have read so far is that this is the only key I need to check to see if the wallet generated by the passphrase contains anything at all, regardless of which one of the sub-addresses generated the payments are sent to.

When checked on blockchain, if the xPub key is displaying a zero bitcoin balance, does this mean the wallet generated from the backup phrase contains nothing?

What is / How to Lightning Network?,"So one thing I have been noticing is that a lot of people do not understand what the Lightning Network is, how it works, how to get bitcoin on it, how to make transactions etc..

"In the future, what can Bitcoin offer the everyday user which is similar to interest you would get from your average bank?","Believe it or not, IMO (not a credible source) Bitcoin markets will eventually become more stable in terms of price fluctuation, whether it's in 10 years or 40 years, it has happen if it is to be mass adopted. People won't want to keep there money in BTC if this it's a case of them having $2000 one day and $1000 then next (using dollar as a value because I don't know what the dominant currency will be in the future). 

Currently banks in the UK currently offer interest rates varying from 0.8% to around 3% depending on what bank you are with. There are also many other interest options, not mention any other investment option the banks offer.

Is it possible that a release of a song called 'Bitcoin' helped the bull run?,"So theres a spanish rap battle freestyler, Chuty, who yesterday released his first studio song called Bitcoin (the chorus says something like 'they didnt bet on me yesterday but want to enjoy me today').
Hes top 2 in the spanish scene (Spain and all central and south america) and the video on YT has already 150k views.

So I was wondering, is it possible that this helped trigger the bull run that just started

What can you do to sustain and grow the price of Bitcoin long term?,"Price is a simple result of supply and demand. If there are more buyers than sellers the price has to go up. There is no way around it. And opposite is true as well. 

How many bitcoin users and holders are out there?

We know there are about 25 million addresses with greater than zero balance, but on one hand many people will have many addresses and many don’t have any as they use custodial accounts. So this is not a good way to tell users, but it gives us an approximation that the magnitude is in the 10s of millions. 

Ledger sold 3 million hardware wallets. I assume that not everyone bought it for Bitcoin. This is just one manufacturer however. And most people don’t use hardware wallets, but paper or regular wallets. And a great number uses custodial wallets (again). Again, hard to tell but this points to around 10a+ million too.

The market cap of Bitcoin is similar to medium sized states like UK, Turkey, Pakistan, etc. which points to a bitcoin ‘population’ of again tens of millions. 

No matter how you look at it the magnitude is similar. Let’s say on the low end 12 million. 

Now, let’s look at the supply.

This one is easy. Miners make 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes on average. Which results in 54K BTC per month. At $7K per coin that is $378 million.

This means to sustain the price we need every bitcoin user to buy $30 worth of Bitcoin every month to sustain the price and anything above that is going to put an upward pressure on the price.

Now, not all has to be bought because btc being ‘used’ in any way removes it from the supply too. So for example if two people use bitcoin to transfer value but neither intends to hold it, for the time of transfer the btc still be ‘held’ for a period of time between it being bought and sold, and if lots of people do this technically no bitcoin needs to be held at all to sustain the price. Also, lots of bitcoins are lost so that should be removed from the supply. 

TLDR;

Bottom line is: save a dollar or more a day in bitcoin and you are doing your part to sustain and grow the price. Use it for payments, especially large value ones, and you will be helping even more without even holding it.

Market Capitalization Clarification,"As usually enormous misunderstandings about the market cap appear especially during strong rises or dips, here is some clarification (for newbies):

If the market rises e.g. by two billion dollars, this does not mean that a person or a bunch of people actually invested two billion dollars (FIAT) in cryptocurrencies. 

Here is a very easy to understand example:

Let us assume 1 BTC has a price of 10.000 $. CryptoCurrency2 has a price of 0.05 BTC and CryptoCurrency3 has a price of 0.001 BTC.

Further there is the following supply in circulation:
BTC: 1.000 
CryptoCurrency2: 10.000
CryptoCurrency3: 100.000

The market cap (e.g. on CMC) would be:
BTC: 1.000 BTC x 10.000 $ = 10.000.000 $
CryptoCurrency2: 10.000 CryptoCurrency2 x 0.05 x 10.000 $ =  5.000.000 $
CryptoCurrency3: 100.000 CryptoCurrency3 x 0.001 x 10.000 $ = 1.000.000 $

In total a market cap of 16.000.000 $

Let us now assume a big filled bitcoin buy order with 1.000.000 $ (and in the meantime no one mined any BTC ;-) )

The price of BTC would increase by 1.000.000 $ / 1.000 BTC = 1.000 $ and the market cap would be:
BTC: 1.000 BTC x 11.000 $ = 11.000.000 $
CryptoCurrency2: 10.000 CryptoCurrency2 x 0.05 x 11.000 $ =  5.500.000 $
CryptoCurrency3: 100.000 CryptoCurrency3 x 0.001 x 11.000 $ = 1.100.000 $

In total a market cap of 17.600.000 $

We therefore see a mismatch between the actual investment with FIAT and the market cap (e.g. on CMC). 
Of course, the more coins and tokens are measured in BTC, the more they increase. For a realistic overview we would need currency/USD pairs everywhere.

Predicting the price of bitcoin,"The price of bitcoin is not like the price of a company's stock, or the value of a currency, or even the price of gold. A company's true value changes in relation to its surrounding industry sector, the performance of the sales of a product, or the changing of management. There is no technical difference between the Euro and the Dollar. More gold can even be produced by investing in mining the Earth's crust for more gold.

Bitcoin is technically unique. It is the first, most battle-tested, most secure, and largest, decentralised currency. And unlike gold, or any other commodity, there is an absolute hard limit of 21m bitcoin that can ever be produced. Any other object in the world can be produced more of, by investing time and human labour to produce it. There are techniques to producing arable land from desert; sea water can be desalinated to make it drinkable; asteroids can be mined for gold - it's not easy, but it's all technically possible. But no matter what we do, we will never produce more than 21m bitcoin. This leads to the conclusion that bitcoin is the first truly scarce store of value (Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard).

Coupled with the utility that bitcoin can also be used as a near-instant digital payment system, this has led to valuations of bitcoin, based purely on its utility, of over $1 million. For example, [one research paper](https://www.scribd.com/document/354688866/Bitcoin-A-5-8-Million-Valuation-Crypto-Currency-and-A-New-Era-of-Human-Cooperation) valued each bitcoin as $5.8 million. [This other valuation (page 1 of 7)](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133818-bitcoin-valuation-4-million) puts it at $4 million. Many others have valued one bitcoin as over a million dollars, taking into account the current size of the gold market, current size of the broad money supply, etc. Bitcoin is technically superior to them all, due to the elimination of trust, and the absolute scarcity. Bitcoin and even the crypto market in general is still [extremely small](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcHBAQaGjez1R26AG6Mrshz74cU1sxTtvCpajABoNeLcE/all-the-worlds-money-and-markets-dv.png).

I believe the price movements seen thus far are bitcoin breaking through dollar price barriers, on the way to its eventual multi-million dollar valuation. There are four major notions to bear in mind:

1. The only factors that influence the price of an object are the true value of it (i.e. how useful it is to humans), and how valuable humans think it is. In other words, the object itself, and the humans that buy/sell it.

2. The technical usefulness of bitcoin hasn't changed (it has, in fact, improved).

3. Since the invention of bitcoin, the human mind has not changed.

4. Due to psychology, immediate price movements of a product influence a human's perception of the value of the product, i.e. regardless of the usefulness of the product itself, if the price is going down, an average human is more likely to sell, if the price is going up, a human is more likely to buy.

For example, if I told you about a company who's shares have gone from under $2000 dollars, to $7000 in a year, that's over 250% yield in a year, which you'd no doubt agree is a stellar investment. But I've just described bitcoin's yield in the last year. People forget that fact, because when they see the chart, they see [this](https://i.imgur.com/VBD3cry.png).

If you were trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin in July 2013, you would be looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/R3aKpiI).

Trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin today, you're looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/eAW89zP).

The similarity is striking. Based on the notions I've just stated, I believe that the pattern of what has already happened will essentially happen again. The conventional mantra of ""past trends do not guarantee future performance"" is a statement that investment companies need to tell people when they try and guess stock price movements. Bitcoin is not the same as any other conventional investment at the moment, and the phrase does not apply. Bitcoin is a newly-discovered commodity. Everything is the same as it was in July 2013 - the product is the same and the humans are the same. Except for one crucial factor. Bitcoin's price is now of the order of $1000 instead of $100. The price movements are becoming ""slower"", i.e. the graph is becoming more ""stretched"", because bitcoin is closer to its true valuation in July 2018 than it was in July 2013. It's a curve approaching a true value - see [this log graph](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXOUJwiVQAAg0R-.jpg:large) of the entire price history and you'll see it's actually becoming less volatile overall.

In terms of the many ""crashes"" that the price has gone through, I believe that this is down to human psychology. Again, nothing changed about the technical utility of bitcoin to force people to sell. There was no CEO fired, no technical fault that was discovered about the blockchain, there was no product released that was a big flop. Bitcoin remained the same. Indeed, the biggest external shock to bitcoin has been the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, which was handling a staggering 70% of bitcoin trades before it went bankrupt in February 2014. What did this do to the price? [It was hit, but not as much as it was hit a few months earlier, at the end of 2013](https://i.imgur.com/BdPSwQz.png).

So what happened at the end of 2013? It was the first time bitcoin was priced at over $1000.

Powers of ten, especially powers of ten of the dollar, which is the most common currency of bitcoin trades, matter hugely. Imagine living in a world where bitcoin had only been worth tens of dollars, then suddenly it's over a hundred dollars. It looks expensive, so you sell. Why do shops sell things at $9.99? Because $10.00 looks expensive. Why do people say ""you look like a million dollars""? Why not ""you look nine hundred grand""? If you told someone ""you look like nine million dollars"", they'd ask, ""why not ten million dollars""? People think in terms of top tens, centuries, millennia. There's a TV show called Who Wants To Be A MiIIionaire, where the top prize is exactly $1,000,000. If the top prize was $999,999 it would be frustrating. If it was $1,245,379 it would be arbitrary and weird.

Human psychology of the power of ten is the only reason for bitcoin's major crashes. If you look at the [all-time log graph, overlaid with dollar powers of ten](https://i.imgur.com/CC25CON.png), you'll notice that every single time bitcoin breached a dollar power of ten, it looked expensive, so people generally stopped buying and started selling. It's that simple. Obviously the pattern won't be perfect - sometimes a whale will come in and temporarily force the price to well over a power of ten before it crashes back down. But the fact is that every time it breaches a power of ten, it looks expensive, so it will be sold until it drops below that power of ten.

What about non-dollar power of tens? In April, a strange price movement happened which looked like a mini-crash, yet it wasn't associated with a dollar price mark. You'll probably be able to identify the price movement [here](https://i.imgur.com/KUcRToF.png). It just so happens that [this mini-crash happened at the 1 million Yen mark](https://i.imgur.com/DgPS7Zn.png). It was the first time it had crossed that value in over a month - Japanese buyers must have seen this, then piled in. It looked expensive to the holders, so they sold. The effect is reduced in scale because the Yen isn't used as much as the dollar - but the effect is the same.

Looking at 2013's crash - the time from breaking through the dollar power of ten barrier and the low point was 3 months. 5 months after that, it had breached the next power of ten, before enduring a longer selling period (the longer selling period is because of people's reluctance to sell something that has just broken through 2 powers of ten. People look at linear graphs, not log graphs). Comparing to the crash we've just gone through, and assuming that we're recovering from the low point now (as it looks like we are), it was around 6-7 months from the power of ten mark and the low point (around twice as long as in 2013). [See comparison](https://i.imgur.com/AZ2qowl.png). Assuming the pattern roughly repeats, I estimate that around July-August 2019, bitcoin will be valued at $100,000. It will peak just above that (maybe $110,000), then endure another very long selling period of several years (someone who famously made a bet about eating part of himself will (un)fortunately lose), where it will reach a low of around $20,000 to $30,000. The cycle will then repeat again, but even slower - it will climb and eventually break through the million dollar barrier, slowly crash below it, then slowly climb possibly to the ten million dollar mark, where it will gradually fall below and settle at its true value of 4-5 million dollars, per the valuations above.",1531935659,18/07/2018 17:40:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zxn7l/predicting_the_price_of_bitcoin/,1

The Truth About Bitcoin!!! A History Lesson.,"## The Truth About Bitcoin!!!

It all goes back to what we believe is the beginning of humanity. It is when we as earthlings began to evolve from primates into early hominids. Then a local passerby of discovered our evolution, many of you refer of them as Lizard people...but in fact they are the Settite Empire.

The Settite Empire is an ancient race that has over a million years of evolution behind it. They wanted to harvest our planet for resources and they wanted to use earthlings as the labour force, but early hominids were very slow and dim-witted, so the Settites began their genetic engineering of us. Similarily another ancient race has also been doing just the same as the Settites, these are the Insectoid Collective. They have also been engineering our race for workers, and with both of their occupation of our planet it has lead them to war for us and our resources. In which I will explain further.

Scientifically the fossil remains of early hominids that we know of are actually the mistakes made by both aliens as they were genetically engineering us from apes. Although from the beginning Settites claim to have seeded earth for evolution as a colony, from what we know of as dinosaurs, but that was foiled by the Insectoids that attacked earth directly, which our only knowledge of that is what we believe is a meteor strike, that decimated 95% of life on earth, but in fact it was an Insectoid weapon. The Settites were not aware of this until after long space travel they returned in order to check on their progress and discovered what had happened, it was through that even the war for our planet and us began.

Through the ages, both of our alien overlords have been controlling humanity to its own gain. Early in our evolution they revealed themselves as gods and god-like entities to rule over us. As their training slowly took us over they knew they were able to hide and put away their whips and watch us evolve into the biological machines they wanted. As we formed societies, they wanted to keep control so that is how groups formed. Illuminati, Knights Templar, Triad, Yakuza, MedJay, Free Masons, Rosicrucians and many similar groups, they are all entities of our overlords meant to control us. Primarily the Illuminati is the order by the Settite Empire , infecting governments, social ladders, everything to keep us in check with their secret motives in mind. The depths of the alien overlord war is deep, as the Insectoid Collective are what remains of the Knights Templar trying to instill their New World Order, trying to break down the walls of governments, instilling unrest and deposition in every turn, turning the world to chaos as both the Settites and the Insectoids use us and control us as pawns in their war for us and our planet, our resources.

How does this involve bitcoin? Bitcoin is created by an anti-government cell posing as a software development team from within the US government that are covert Insectoids and Insectoid Drones trying to overthrow the control of the government and foster its own control through the guise of believed liberation and freedom. The Insectoids knew that the digital currency would foster the minds of youth, anarchists, libertarians and criminals that would try to use bitcoin for their own gain and against governments and banks that are ultimately controlled by the Settite Empire.

Bitcoin is just another attempt by the Insectoids to overthrow the government controlling Settites in their war. They are using us, humans as their pawns and their drones and we can’t let it continue. Stop taking part, don’t use Bitcoin, don’t use banks, don’t trust anyone.

We as a people, all of can’t let the Alien Invaders control us anymore, we can’t be drones, we have been given our own minds and free will, now we must use it. No more drones!

Edward Snowden is actually an Insectoid Drone, that has been implanted in the US Government to create dissent among society. Its a ploy to disrupt structure. Like all the Aliens, they must be shunned and kicked off our planet.

Every little thing that happens is by their design, to use us, to control us all, Settites controlling us with structure, and the Insectoids controlling us with anarchism and chaos, trying to rebuild what was already built. We can't let this go on any longer! Expose the Settite leaders, expose the Insectoid disruptors, free our planet, free us from the Alien Controllers. Your Illuminati theories are a start but they miss by miles, I know the truth. I shall reveal to you how.

Both the Settites and the Insectoids use special emitters to focus brains and send suggestions and orders to control minds. Both races have hive minds, networks. And through my psychic mind, I can travel the link when they try to focus my mind, and I have been able to travel the link and see the central network of both Hive minds, I have seen all that they see, as if I was one of them. They intend to control us and use our planet and people for their own gain. Once we are exhausted they will leave us behind, they help create us, mold us and will cast us out. Lets not let that happen, rise against the Aliens. Fight their mental control, when your mind feels hot, seek the heat, find the beam, invade the hive minds and see all for truth. Once we all know, they will be exposed and will be forced to flee or fight, and if its fight, we as humanity must be ready. We need to use what we learn and create our own hive mind, so we can think as one, as one earth, and liberate us all.

Say no to Aliens, say yes to Earth!

P.S. It's little known fact that Beliebers are the newest group to attempt to control humanity, the Insectoids have beginning at a young age to warp and control humanity, Rise against the Aliens!",1531936517,18/07/2018 17:55:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zxrrl/the_truth_about_bitcoin_a_history_lesson/,1

I'm cleaning and recently stumbled upon the piece of paper which I believe has my bitcoin wallet recovery phrase.  I remember forgetting about bitcoin a long time ago and losing my wallet.  I know every software is different for generating recovery phrases.  I remember my wallet was running on a Linux system.

The recovery phrase is of the form:

xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

Where the x's are letters and numbers.

Please help me find the software with this as the recovery phrase format.  I think I had a little bit in the wallet, which today, no doubt, would not be a lot but still definitely more than a while back.

Coinbase disabled my account after my initial purchase - I need coins in my cold storage - better options?,"With my cold storage set up and I tried to test the waters with Coinbase buying a small amount of each of the four cryptos that they offer and they took the funds from my bank account and disabled my account so I cannot send them out. Crazy. I contacted them and they said that the account has to be reviewed and it will take at least four days. So I contacted my bank and began an ACH dispute and to make a long story short I do not want to use Conbase anymore. Ever since the Ether Flash Crash I knew that this place was sketchy and now with an account in hand I can confirm that it is really a shady firm. Anyway does anyone have any better suggestions to buy coins so I can send them to my cold storage? Is Gemini the real deal?

Hodl VS Use&amp;Refill,"Now that we have the glorious Sigwit and almighty Lightning Network in place, both technologies allow cheaper transactions and give a great opportunity for a wider adoption.

ALLCRRYTPOALARM: Set pricealarms for 1400 Coins and Fiats,"Hey Guys, so I spend the last few months building [ALLCRYPTOALARM](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/allcryptoalarm/id1405520469?mt=12), an **MAC OS** App that helps you keep track of your Crypto prices and gives you the easy possibility to set price alarms for any two of the **1400** Coins and Fiats supported.

Yes, 1400. Compare anything.

for those curious: [https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/allcryptoalarm/id1405520469?mt=12](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/allcryptoalarm/id1405520469?mt=12)

I am posting here to reach an audience that:

1. is actually in need of such a tool. I hope I offer you an App that improves your daily trading. With [ALLCRYPTOALARM](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/allcryptoalarm/id1405520469?mt=12)I also hope to be giving something back to the community. Thank you!
2. is willing to give me Feedback and critique. I am rather **new to coding** and this is my **first project** where I am actually proud to put my name under. So any critique, be it just a simple **bug** or a (constructive) **rant** about the UX, i would be very happy to receive! Thank you for your time.

In a nutshell:

* supports over **1400** **Coins**
* supports **USD, EUR, AUD, JPY, GBP, CAD**
* set/edit/delete alarms for any two Coins/Fiats

And that's that. Thanks for your time. Have a **magnificent** day!!",1531976941,19/07/2018 05:09:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/902xs7/allcrrytpoalarm_set_pricealarms_for_1400_coins/,1

This is my sad story...,"Hi\~ everyone\~

I am a poor person living in a small country somewhere on the earth.

I have been looking for data on bit coin and have come to see it all the way.

I do not care much, but I try to tell you my story. I would appreciate it if you would listen to me.

I have two friends. But every time I see them, I say, 'I'm so poverty hard.'

Of course I can not understand that feeling. But in every country, only the middle class and the upper class live richly, and others can not escape the downstream life.

But this pitiful poverty. If you do not have the property to inherit even if you try to escape, it will only be a retirement of poverty.

I thought that I lived so hard, but I did not have the luck or the situation seemed to be the same all the time.

So I started hunting the internet in 2012 to make a difference in my life.

I learned bit coin by about 2012, and I remember that it was one dollar coin one bit at the time.

I could not buy because I did not have money. Of course it is the same now.

So at that time I tried to do mining, but it was disappointing to realize that it was hard for my computer to wait 10 minutes before booting and 5 minutes to boot and the system to return to normal.

Now, when the beat coin shines and the value of the world currency is recognized, if I had only $ 100 to buy a 100-bit coin, I would not have been like that. after...

My father is already dead, my mother is sick, and I have to lie down at home. I have nothing to do, so I am helpless and lost my will in life.

I wish there was no next life if this life ended.

Bitcoin is activated, and it is a currency that can be used in remote areas around the world, and I hope everyone around the world enjoy the benefits and freedom of communication.

So everyone is healthy, I will reduce it. Bye\~

If you want to send a coin to someone who is working for the future, I would appreciate it if you give me a cent.

And I will try to write again on this board.

My bit coin purse address ..

17YyEpCe3u82NCrNehbgQ6Ug4fmNYkY6Sp

Thank you for listening to me so far \~",1531983377,19/07/2018 06:56:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/903jlh/this_is_my_sad_story/,1

Managing world value with Bitcoin,"Hello everybody !

I like economics and cryptos so I will provide you with a baby mix of both.

In order to survive in this cypto bear market (which is a great opportunity to accumulate each month if you believe in it), reading books on economics / cryptocurrencies and searching for some real facts turns out to be very useful.

Hereunder you will find what I thought to be interesting. Don't be discouraged by the length, I am almost sure it will bring you some value.

Here are some interesting numbers and calculations according to Visual Capitalist 2017 VS Bitcoin :

\- The total value of the world listed equities is $80 Trillion, bitcoin is 1.4% of it

\- The total broad money is $90 Trillion (including banknotes, money market, savings, time deposits), bitcoin is 1.1%,

\-The total global debt is $215 Trillion (governments, corporations, households), with $70 Trillion added the last decade alone (since the financial crisis), bitcoin is 0.47%

\-Global Real Estate is $217 Trillion, bitcoin is 0.46%

\-Derivative market is $544 Trillion (low end estimate on a notional contract basis, haha), bitcoin is 0.18%.

As you can see, even if you like to measure bitcoin versus $ (and don't view bitcoin as an unit of account), you should be very bullish if you believe in its fundamentals (e.g technology, network) and in a potential global adoption as a medium of exchange and/or store of value and/or unit of account.

It means that if Bitcoin reaches $250,000 (like Tim Draper predicts) or $4.4 Trillion total market capitalization, it will still be very small in this dollars value/money world.

Kind regards everybody.",1531984460,19/07/2018 07:14:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/903nbn/managing_world_value_with_bitcoin/,1

"How will Bitcoin reach $1,000,000?","Some post-lunch thoughts: How do you see Bitcoin reaching the value of $1 million USD, or do you think it will ever reach this number?

* The US Dollar gets hyperinflated and loses most of it's value
* Bitcoin gets massadopted and the demand surpasses the current quantity.
* Some other reason?

Also, do you think valuating Bitcoin with FIAT currency is a problem? What happens in a world where FIAT becomes obsolete (it probably won't though)? Why would I want to know how many USD a bit (100 satoshi) is worth if the dollar is worthless?

"EOS is accused of deliberately congesting the Ethereum network, iFish Yunyu suspected to be a helper.","In recent years, blockchain technology has developed rapidly, the emergence of EOS has brought a strong impact on ETH (Ethernet Network).

https://i.redd.it/8x4e20sw2wa11.png

Recently, a group of gaming DApp development teams led by Justo accused the EOS team of deliberately concealing the Ethereum network, they even pointed out that this is a well-planned attack: since the launch of the EOS platform, a large number of token ""airdrops"" have been consumed every day. A large number of token ""airdrops"" consume hundreds of Ethereum every day! As a result, the Ethereum network is congested, and the price of Gas has risen sharply! What's more chilling is that these tokens are basically not supported by any actual projects, but the consumption is as high as tens of thousands of dollars! Things seem to be more than that simple.!As a result, the Ethereum network is congested, and the price of Gas has risen sharply! What's more chilling is that these tokens are basically not supported by any actual projects, but the consumption is as high as tens of thousands of dollars!

https://i.redd.it/e2ytlr8z2wa11.png

Things seem to be not such simple.

Justo revealed that he investigated the funds and actions of an airdrop token for ""iFishYunYu"" on the EOS platform and found that the token was completely free of all functions, but frequently transferred the token back and forth to the same account! This is a false transaction undoubtedly and it consumes 20% of the Ethereum network! And this also costs a lot of money!

So Justo pointed out that only EOS can have so much financial and material resources to do these things, and the iFishYunYu cloud fish project is suspected to be the helper of EOS hiring.

It is understood that the iFish team was founded in November 2017. According to their published white paper plan, they have landed iFish games, K5 wallets and other applications as well as connected on the platform supported by their iFish chain into a variety of games.

The iFishYunYu token was released in January this year. The ifish game developed by the company is based on the foundation. It is not like what Justo said: there is no function at all. On the contrary, iFish Yunyu, as the world's first completely decentralized blockchain game project, has made breakthroughs in traditional centralized games what gradually being understood and be paid more and more by investors and players.

It is reported that the iFishYunYu Yunyu project party is also plagued by the long-standing congestion problem of the Ethereum network. On July 3, it issued an ""official delay in token recharge"" to its player users through official channels to apologize.

From this point of view, Justo's statement is not really convincing and the iFishYunYu project is not like its so-called ""helper.""

*Processing img 8uf8i2a23wa11...*

In response, the iFishYunYu project responded: the team reversed the right and wrong, arbitrarily attacking the EOS and blockchain project iFish , which invisibly adversely affected the EOS and ifish communities. Based on this, ifish project party has sent the first letter of the multinational lawyer to the main person in charge of the team!

In addition, BM denied deliberate attacks on the Ethereum network that the device was too low-end, saying it would not be stupid enough to abuse its resources to attack Ethereum. Then, in addition to giving Ethereum a sneer, ""A CryptoKitties game in a district can cause congestion,"" EOS has no other response.

https://i.redd.it/pj0ke0f43wa11.png

At present, whether the congestion of the Ethereum network is controlled by the EOS team, whether the ifish is an EOS hitter cannot be determined.But there is no doubt that the long-term congestion of the Ethereum network has indeed been criticized, and ETH has a significant impact on the operation and distribution of various items on the blockchain. If the situation has not improved in the past, it is not impossible for ETH to be replaced by a more reliable platform.

From this point of view, perhaps ETH would like to thank the emergence of the EOS platform for the sense of crisis, so that its own shortcomings are deeply valued, which can stimulate the Ethereum network to have better improvement.

Therefore, for Ethereum network developers, stepping up and implementing the Ethereum network expansion plan is more important and more meaningful than suspicion of EOS.",1531999363,19/07/2018 11:22:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/904zpt/eos_is_accused_of_deliberately_congesting_the/,1

How does the greed shield Bitcoin against excessive regulations.,"Some governments, often despite their own old instincts, must support Bitcoin to maintain the long-term economic stability. Taxing Bitcoin, although being undesirable and highly difficult to implement, present, nonetheless, much better alternative to excessive regulations or to a complete ban. Here's an example of Latvia.

During the past decade Latvian financial watch-dogs have showed themselves ostensibly wary of everything related to money transfers in and out of the country. Many local politicians have repeatedly accentuated the necessity to strengthen AML and KYC procedures in Latvian banks. Against that background the official position of Latvijas Banka towards Bitcoin looks surprisingly dovish.

It doesn't mean, of course, that Latvian central bakers have ever revealed any warm feelings towards it. Nonetheless, in those few quasi-official statements, which reached public ears (including that of July 24, 2014), local financial authorities only bothered to mention that Bitcoin does not constitute the legal tender and it is not supported by the Latvian central government.

This incongruity might be explained by two facts. First, despite that Latvia, as its two neighbours - Estonia and Lithuania - has been traditionally open to technological innovations, the popularity of Bitcoin in there is on the below-than-average level (for an EU country). There are only 14 (from more than 9.5th) local Bitcoin nodes (45th place) and no Bitcoin ATMs in this country with about 2 million inhabitants. For comparison, Lithuania, with 2.8 million people living there, hosts 68 nodes and Estonia (1.3 million) - 10 nodes.

Secondly, looks like Latvian government's financiers, even after all those loud political declarations, have more important matters to attend than to heroically defend their country against an illusory threat represented by Bitcoin. Such matters, for example, include replenishing country's coffers emptied by the 2008 financial crisis and by the subsequent economic downturn.

To prove this point on April 16, 2018 the Latvian Finance Ministry declared that 20% tax might be imposed on profits derived from Bitcoin prices increase. Still, for all intend and purposes, faced by the absence of regulatory framework, the future of Bitcoin remains undecided in Latvia.

Business Notes for Latvian Startups Founders:

political climate: moderately friendly;
economic climate: moderately friendly;
regions to focus: Eastern Europe;
industries to focus: e-commerce, marketplaces, SaaS, FinTech;
major limitations: small economy (GDP is under $30 billion), small population (under 2 million), relatively high taxes (Individual income tax rate at 23%);
stimulus: GDP growth rate at 4%, fixed Internet penetration rate at 80%, educated work-force, mid-income population (per-capita at $14,000);
opportunities: to create an e-business aimed at young generation of users of mobile Internet in Eastern European countries.
Bitcoin (outlook): not regulated (moderately positive).

Passing on your bitcoin.,"Been dealing with more estates and death than I would like lately. Getting around to actually making a will and I am wondering about transferring crypto. I currently just have a coinbase account, reading their [FAQ](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2321225-how-do-i-gain-access-to-a-deceased-family-member-s-coinbase-account-) they follow pretty normal rules for transferring an account but you can not name a beneficiary. 

Once I transfer to a private wallet though I worry about whoever is executing the will not understanding or having to leave detailed instructions that obviously would pose a security risk... it seems like it would be very easy for the wallet to be ""lost"" or otherwise misappropriated.

Wondering if anyone has a plan or good ideas to make it smooth and easy. ",1532015617,19/07/2018 15:53:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9071pm/passing_on_your_bitcoin/,1

Neutralize now accepting Bitcoin with Bitpay on website ( US shipping ONLY for Now),"We  are excited to accept Bitcoin on our new  product Neutralize by Advanced  Dietary Formulas.  Do you enjoy a few  alcoholic beverages, but want to  feel better the next day?

Neutralize   reduces  acetaldehyde, which is the main carcinogenic metabolite   resulting from  alcohol (ethanol) consumption. As a matter of fact, a   key ingredient in  Neutralize reduced acetaldehyde by 100% after 50mls   of alcohol (ethanol)  was consumed by human subjects compared to   placebo.

Neutralize  was developed for   consumers that are ambitious, health conscious and  still want to have   fun. Neutralize will not prevent intoxication.

We   understand that the average supplement consumer has been deceived   many  times when it comes to supplements and their efficacy. We spent 3   years formulating Neutralize, and **we  believe in our product so strongly  we are willing to give out free  samples to prove to our future  customers  that Neutralize works.**

**Enter your email  on our website** [**www.getneutralized.com**](https://www.getneutralized.com/) **and  you will immediately receive an email with a  link and password to   access the free sample checkout. No credit card  information required,   no shipping cost to you! We just want you to try it! US ONLY for now  until we figure out international shipping/ regulations. Limit one  totally free sample per customer.** We are available in the EU now through  [Prometeus.nl](https://prometeus.nl/)  the largest nutritional supplement distributor in Europe. They can  inform you when and who in the EU will supply Neutralize based on your  location in EU.

[www.getneutralized.com](https://www.getneutralized.com/)  Thanks for the support Bitcoin community!

purchased high traffic domain-- what now?,"Hi! I recently bought a domain that I am shocked isn't already owned, and it's getting significant web traffic. Next, I want to benefit from referral/affiliate programs for coin-based payment gateways and exchanges (ie coinbase, coingate, etc). I'm not super familiar with what's out there today. Commission structure, market reputation, which country the company is based out of, and other common questions are all up for consideration. Thanks for your help, I'm really interested to see what people are the most confident in.

For a baseline, I'll probably choose the top 3 exchanges, and coin-based payment gateways to start.

"Twitter, Roger Ver and Jihan Wu","I have a weird feeling that Roger and Jihan a bit more than regular twitter users. Maybe twitter should include in their policies that mentioning these names in tweets may lead to locking tweeting user's account.
First time my account was locked after tweet to Roger Ver, and just now I have to prove to Twitter that I'm owner of my account and not a robot after mentioning Jihan Wu in my reply. It never happened to my account except these two times.
I might be wrong, also I will avoid these names in my tweets.
I would not care too much if Twitter would not be one of the main crypto social platforms.

If I was to hold coins in a wallet and that wallet later became obsolete due to the company folding or from a hack, would I still be able to retrieve my coins/tokens?

The key is directly associated to the main net, not to the actual wallet itself. 

If however, its is a cold storage, then the tokens/coins can be lost if the hardware is damaged, lost or stolen since it does not exist anywhere else except on that cold storage.

"Article for local paper, some feedback would be helpful","The Importance of Bitcoin:
The purpose of this article is to inform you on the arguments made for bitcoin and how those arguments relate to growth of bitcoin since it’s inception. 
To set the premise I like the comparison of Bitcoin to the English language.  It is spoken globally, and is useful in communication. It can be translated to other languages, or currencies. The English language like Bitcoin also has no central authority. No President or CEO of the English Language, it is a good we can use or not use as we please. The value of the English language comes from many speakers of the language, similar to adoption and bitcoin value. 
Becoming a reality in late 2008, bitcoin was born. Bitcoin is network of computers that agree on a public ledger. Within this network is contained a currency recorded in the ledger. New bitcoin is created by way of computers competing to solve the balance changes and maintaining security of the ledger. This network of computers is the first to complete instantaneous, trust-less and basically free transfers of money globally, 24/7, and without anyone’s permission. This is the brief.
Money itself has no value. We attribute value to it based on the goods and services we can receive for it. Money must have certain characteristics in order to be a good form of money. These are things we all inherently understand but rarely are concerned with improving on.
Durability: Money shouldn’t break down.
Uniformity: Does one shell = one shell?
Divisibility: Half a chicken doesn’t work, see durability.
Limited Supply: If it isn’t scarce it doesn’t have value.
Portable: Cards are easier than gold coins.
Store of Value: Saving shouldn’t mean a loss of value
Acceptability: Do you take bitcoin? No, why would I?
Currently, people rely on governments to control and create their currency. This has worked well and under this system we have achieved some long-sustained growth. With flaws though, the average fiat currency lifespan is about 22 years. Evidenced in recent memory by hyperinflation in Venezuela and Zimbabwe or Greece’s debt crisis or in 2016 when India deemed all 500 and 1,000 Rupees notes not viable as currency. Fiat currencies are also often inflationary, equating to, loss of purchasing power over time. (USD June 2018 Inflation Rate 2.87%) For example, $100 in 2000 equals $146 now. Discouraging for savers who see less than 2% return on their money in the bank. Furthermore, being run centralized means they are susceptible to human error or abuse. Another obviously is the geographic constraints of a government currency.
So how does Bitcoin play into the currency sphere. Currency is market of competition. People choose the currency that best suits their needs. Now, every currency in the world has to compete with Bitcoin. These are the characteristics that Bitcoin has that give it a competitive advantage.
First, Bitcoin exists. It cannot be stopped, short of shutting down the internet worldwide. This is due to its decentralized nature, there is no central authority and has value as long as there are two participants who prefer it to other competitors. Anyone with an internet connection and the most basic phone can participate.
Trust-less: For the first-time wealth can transferred great distance without a third party. Western Union and MoneyGram are not needed. This has the added benefit of reducing the frictional cost of sending money by eliminating middle-men. Even payment processors can cost business’s 1-2% of their revenue when you use credit or debit cards.
Uncensored: Bitcoin is decentralized, this means it exists without a gatekeeper or central authority. You do not have to ask permission to use your money. Instead, you are your own bank. Much like cash doesn’t require permission to be spent, neither does bitcoin. This makes it useful for illicit activity but in general means freedom for your money. In 2010, the US government pressured Visa and Mastercard to stop American citizens from supporting Wikileaks, asymmetric political censorship. Furthermore, your account cannot be frozen or funds stolen from you. Valuable to anyone living under an oppressive regime. To be put simply, a refugee could carry his life savings in his head. 
Accountability: Next, we must remember this is a public ledger. This means we can eliminate fraud and abuse of all types. Recently, the public ledger was used as evidence against 12 Russians involved in our elections. So, while it provides the freedom of money that criminals like, it also leaves behind a trail for investigators to follow. The applications of financial transparency are easy recognizable, political campaigns, government spending and perfect accounting for any business.
Decentralization of money creation: Anyone can become a miner or buy mining contracts to be involved in the creation of new bitcoin. Creation of new bitcoin is the mechanism that incentives the integrity of the ledger. The supply of bitcoin is mathematically metered such that by roughly 2140 there will be no more bitcoin created. Roughly 21 million in total. 
Perfect Scarcity: The crux of the bitcoin argument is that for the first time we can achieve perfect and verifiable scarcity and have every property that makes money, good money. Supply and demand governs the price of goods, and money is the only good that buys all goods and services. Demand for money is ever persistent and growing. Supply of bitcoin is limited. The US dollar has decreasingly bought less bitcoin over time and bitcoin has bought increasingly more US dollars over time. The difference is the global citizenry beginning to agreeing that savers should be rewarded instead of punished. A deflationary currency. The vast majority of people do not receive income raises that out-compete the cost of inflation. Saving wealth used to be a viable and risk-free option for the poor to achieve financial prosperity.
Bitcoin’s growth comes from people using it for any of the above reasons. Remember Bitcoin is only 10 years old. As people use it for whatever they wish it starts to retain wealth. As it retains wealth, it becomes a viable store of value like gold, these factors all work in tandem to grow bitcoin over time. Add in some irrational exuberance and we hit 20k. Two key takeaways are, bitcoin will continue to exist for the short-medium term and as long as it provides an alternative for someone it will hold value.

My research about wallets,"There are 5 different types of wallet out their which makes it much harder to chooser. I did some research here is my conclusion when you choose:

1. Desktop wallets (Like Exodus, mSIGNA): You should prepare one-dedicated-computers to make sure nothings wrong happens
1. Mobile wallets (Like Infinito Wallet, Ethos): Like desktop, going professional - you need a phone for that + remember your passphrase to recover. This option works best for me because it is very convinient.
1. Cloud Wallet - while they are more convenient to access, online wallets store your private keys online and are controlled by a third party which makes them more vulnerable to hacking attacks and theft.
1. Hardware - easily transact while also keeping your money offline and away from danger. But yes, you lose the hardware mean you loose it all, can recover like using passphrases in Infinito Wallet
1. Paper. Keep the paper safe + time consuming transaction procedure. Have fun.
1. I currently use Exodus and Infinito Wallet.

Daily Market Recap - 07/20 - BTC Dominance up to 45% as it outperforms cryptomarkets,"[https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/bitcoins-and-u-s-dollar-bills-730547\/](https://i.redd.it/e7sver28j3b11.jpg)

When the Big Brother keeps pushing it and the little ones can’t keep up. This is the crypto market today as Bitcoin continues gains but the rest of Top 10 coins are not performing as they should. Usually when Bitcoin moves, it takes majority of the coins with it on a ride. In a sideways market, especially when the price of Bitcoin remains stable, tokens tend to perform exceedingly well against major digital assets.

It’s been a bullish week and today at the Asian Markets, Bitcoin is still feeling the effects of its mini bull run last Wednesday. The market capitalization is at $284.8 Billion, 3 Billion lower than yesterday and the 24 hour volume is at $16.4 Billion, a shot less than yesterday’s $18.5 Billion.  

Bitcoin dominance is at an all time high at 45%. From its mini bull run, it went 2 points higher in dominance. Its volume, which remained below $3.5 billion last week, has rebounded to $5.2 billion, and tripled on the global market’s largest crypto exchange Binance.

Currently. Bitcoin’s growth is 1.04% and price is at $7478. Bitcoin price mostly traded in a range above near the $7400 level and seems to be struggling to clear the $7555 and $7575 resistance levels.

Looking at the chart, the price is mostly consolidating, but it seems to be losing momentum above $6400. Therefore, there is a risk of a downside break towards $7250 and $7140.

On the 4 hour chart, MACD is coming down to the bearish side. The green RSI is turning up above 50. The yellow SRSI is coming down to hard to the oversold area. The Money Flow Index  is also below 40 and almost on the oversold.

JRE - Peter Schiff on Bitcoin,"I was watching The Joe Rogan Experience earlier. His guest was Peter Schiff. It's fair to say that Peter is relatively anti-crypto and deals heavily in gold. TBH, I'm not entirely sold that Bitcoin can last through a major financial crisis, but I would entertain optimism. I was interested in their relative price points. So, I briefly looked at the two over past couple years. I noticed a large coincidence that high price points in gold result in low price points for Bitcoin, and vice versa. Could it be that he is so opposed to Bitcoin because there is some sort of inverse relationship between the two?

Probably could have put this train of though together a little better but I'm on a break at work. So, if you can't follow it move the fuck on.",1532101154,20/07/2018 15:39:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/90h0qg/jre_peter_schiff_on_bitcoin/,1

For example, suppose I talk the local bar owner into accepting Bitcoin.  I'll want to henceforth show up regularly, and spend Bitcoin there.  Obviously.

The thing is, my phone... you'd laugh.  Everybody laughs at my phone, which is okay, but there's NO WAY to put Bitcoin wallet software onto my phone (it's practically from the 1980's).  And.  I'm not interested in getting a smartphone, ever.  (I think...)

Optimal Block Construction: A miner question,"Hey guys, 

How do miners go about the process of constructing optimal blocks? 

The problem would be to: select an optimal subset of transactions from the MemPool such that the value to the miner in fees is maximized subject to the constraint that the block size is under 1MB. 

This is the classic knapsack optimization problem and as I understand it is NP-Complete. Are the miners running dynamic algorithms to solve this problem when they construct blocks? Or are they going with some less optimal (from a fee value perspective) but more optimal (from a time perspective) solution ?

Thanks. ",1532102968,20/07/2018 16:09:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/90ha79/optimal_block_construction_a_miner_question/,1

"Haven't opened multibit wallet in months, now it is empty! What do I do?","I've been keeping my bitcoins in multibit for years and check on them every couple of months. Today when I opened multibit I see that my balance is 0! When I go to [multibits website](https://multibit.org/blog/2017/07/26/multibit-shutdown.html) it appears that the developers have shut it down and recommend moving to electrum.   

I'm staying calm, but I'm very concerned all my bitcoins are gone. I don't need a lecture on why I should have moved to a new wallet months ago. I don't really follow bitcoin news much and didn't know multibit was shutting down. What I *do* need is some advice on how to recover my bitcoins. 

When I email multibit, they respond with an email forwarding me to the [support page](https://multibit.org/blog/2017/07/26/multibit-shutdown.html) and the [export to electrum youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaijbTcxsv8)  


[](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x7v83uis5kltizr/Screenshot%202018-07-20%2007.53.02.png?dl=0)  

Here is what I have done so far:   

1. I have opened a multibit.wallet from my time machine from 6 months ago (the last time I was positive the balance was there). I let that wallet 'sync' with the network. It shows 0 bitcoins and no transaction history (which is weird because I should have a transaction history).   

2. I have gone to my cloud provider where I kept a backup of my private keys. I've tried to 'restore' that key to electrum but the length appears to be incorrect because the 'next' button is greyed out  

[](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6b5nvb637w7gdoa/Screenshot%202018-07-20%2010.12.29.png?dl=0)  

3. I've tried re-exporting my private key from multibit classic and importing to electrum, but again the key length is incorrect  

4. I've tried to create a 'watching only' wallet in electrum to 'watch' my old wallet. It also shows there is 0 history to my wallet. 

5. I've tried installing the [mbexport node cli tool](https://github.com/Multibit-Legacy/read-multibit-wallet-file) to export my private keys. Unfortunately it has a bug

What else can I do reddit? Please help.

Academic research about cryptocurrency adoption,"Hi everyone, I’m part of a research team at the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and we are currently doing a research about the adoption determinants of cryptocurrencies. 

Due to the lack of academic research in this area and in the cryptocurrency and blockchain areas overall, this topic was chosen for my Master’s degree thesis and for a couple of scientific papers.

The goal of this research is to understand what drives people to use cryptocurrencies and it goes a lot beyond of the “I’m here for the money” or “I’m here for the technology”. 

For this, it was created a questionnaire with Likert type scale questions addressing different dimensions. These dimensions will then be used to construct a model, based on the traditional Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed in 1989, and some others developed afterwards, but with more dimensions and adapted to the cryptocurrencies ecosystem. Then it will be done some data analysis and compilation of results, there will be a lot more but I won’t complicate.

It takes on average 3 minutes to answer (5 min maximum). Your input is really important for this research and to help us and other researchers to boost academic knowledge in this area.

After analysing and publishing the thesis and papers I will post here again with infographics and the most important conclusions of the study.

We believe that after knowing in detail what drives the population to cryptocurrencies adoption a door will be open to help knowing how this ecosystem should develop in the future.

Here is the link for the questionnaire [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies\_usage](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies_usage)

Thank you all for your participation!

Why we need bitcoin,"There will be no middle class, only rulers and servants. [...] The system will be on the basis of a welfare state [..] The U.S. Constitution will be abolished and become forbidden reading. [...] Marriage shall be outlawed and there shall be no family life as we know it. Children shall be removed from their parents at an early age and brought up as wards of the state; state property. [...] Women will be degraded through the continued process of ""women's liberation"" movements. Free sex shall be mandatory. [...] Self abortion shall be taught and practiced after two children are born to a woman. [...] Pornography shall be promoted and be compulsory reading in every school classroom and shown in theaters and cinemas, including homosexual and lesbian pornography. The use of ""recreational"" drugs shall no longer be subject to criminal penalties [...] Mind-control drugs will be expanded [...] the non-elite masses will be reduced to a level of behavior of beasts, with no will of their own [...] All wealth shall be aggregated in the hands of the elite members of the Committee of 300. Each individual shall be indoctrinated to understand that he or she is totally dependent upon the state for survival. [...] At least four billion ""useless eaters"" shall be eliminated by the year 2050 by means of limited wars and organized epidemics of fatal rapid-acting pandemics and starvation. [...] The United States will be flooded by people of an alien culture, who will eventually overwhelm the stock of the original Americans who built America [...] No national banks except the Bank of International Settlements and the World Bank shall be allowed to operate. [...] There shall be no cash or coinage in the hands of the non-elite. All transactions shall be carried out by means of a debit card [...] Attempts to trade ""old"" coins, that is to say, silver coins of previous and now defunct nations, shall be treated as a capital crime, subject to the death penalty. [...] Outlaws who fail to surrender to the police or military, after a declared period of time, shall have a family member selected at random to serve prison terms in their stead. [...] wars of attrition shall take place before the take-over of the One World Government, and shall be engineered on every continent where large groups of people with ethnic and religious differences reside.

CoinMarketCap Removes Volume Requirements for Cryptocurrency Exchange Listing,"Cryptocurrency data aggregation site [CoinMarketCap](http://ccn.com/tag/coinmarketcap) has removed volume requirements for exchanges listed on its platform, citing concerns over data transparency and clarity.

The platform, the 276th-most popular website according to Alexa, made this announcement in a [blog post](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2018/07/19/coinmarketcap-stands-for-data-transparency-and-clarity/), responding to a barrage of criticism that exchanges have been gaming its statistical algorithms to get listed more easily and rank higher once they do, providing them with more visibility and prestige.

Users have long complained that [exchanges](http://ccn.com/exchanges) inflate their volumes using low-fee models, which encourage traders to increase their activity, either manually or with bots, to receive lower per-trade fees.

Similarly, many exchanges have been accused of using questionable methods to increase their volume, whether through exchange-operated market making services or straight-up [wash trading](https://www.ccn.com/kraken-strikes-back-at-tether-price-manipulation-claims/).

The latest volume-enhancing scheme is so-called “transaction mining,” which has cropped up in popularity among many trading platforms that now rank toward the top of CMC’s daily volume charts. In this model, exchanges technically charge transaction fees but indirectly refund them by issuing their own cryptocurrency tokens to traders.

Rather than censor such exchanges, though, CoinMarketCap said that it will instead attempt to “over-provide” on data and tools to analyze it, giving individuals the ability to reach informed conclusions on their own.

&gt;“Even though we try our best to verify the data with the exchanges on our site, we are not in the practice of censoring or policing others. In an open ecosystem like the one we are in, we believe that the best policy – that we follow closely – is to over-provide on data and let users make their own informed choices about what to do with that data.”

Some of these new tools include the ability to view exchange volume over a longer time horizon than the 24-hour rankings currently available, as well a filtering tool that helps users distinguish between exchanges that operate on different fee models.

CoinMarketCap Removes Volume Requirements for Cryptocurrency Exchange ListingCoinMarketCap Removes Volume Requirements for Cryptocurrency Exchange Listing Again, we want to state that our philosophy is to provide as much information as possible to our users, so that they can form their own conclusions and interpretations – and not introduce our own bias into that mix,” the company concluded, adding that “ it is an extremely demanding problem that requires all our stakeholders in the cryptocurrency community to solve.”

My wife and I recently bought a house and for anyone else who bought their first house knows money gets tight in the beginning.  My wife wanted a fairly large purchase that was a want, not a need, so we shopped around for a bit and then I remembered overstock.com accepts BTC.  I have done fairly well with Bitcoin but have never used it, sent it, sold it, etc. Using it was extremely easy and I had a confirmation in under 4 minutes.  Not bad from 6 months ago!

"My BitcoinTalk forum account has been hacked... (on 31 may 2018), what now?"," Hello

My   dear account on bitcoin talk forum, which (account) i have created  back  in 2013 was hacked/stolen 31 may 2018... I just found about it  today...  The account was using my other secondary email adress on gmail  which i  dont access too often. Today i wante to write on bitcoinalk,  couldnt  login, check my email and noticed that on 31 may 2018 i had two  emails  from bitcointalk.1st informing me about changing my email  associated   with BTCtalk account to:

[phamthienuser@gmail.com](mailto:phamthienuser@gmail.com) by IP address [42.112.83.131](https://42.112.83.131/)

None of these are mine, not the email and not the  IP.

2nd email informed me about chaning my password on BTCtalk forum...

So   i assume some fucker stole my dear 5 year old account on bitcoin   talk!!! I searched and noticed that the fucker does even post new posts   (altought not yet threads) on that forum...? like WTF?

Its this account:

[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=187297](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=187297)

AFAIK   i didnt use the exact password i used on BTCtalk anywhere else so my   other account all over the internet should be save (i hope)...? I also   didnt have anything ""private"" (AFAIK) ""stored"" or ""mentioned"" on the   account (like in private messages etc.) SO i should be quite safe... (?)   i Hope.

Still can i somehow get the accoutn back? Or at least terminate that account so that fucker doesnt impersonate me??

Also,   how could that fucker hack it...? Its some asian guy i think (he cites   asian accounts from tradingview etc.). My password wasnt the stronget   but still i dont know how he could get it...?? (it was smt like   ""TrolleiTrollei""  (thats 2 english, slightly modified existing words,   following each other with capital letter at the begging)...

I   know BitcoinTalk forum was hacked in 2015, my account was created in   2013, so it was probably compromised in that hack and now i realize i   didnt do nothing probably then... dont know why...? Probably tried to   login, notice its ok so i assume my account wasnt hacked...? I checked   my password manager in my internet browser and it shows change of   password (by me) on BTCtalk in 2017... but no email came so it was just   probably changed/updated by the same password in my browser only...So i   guess he got my passwor from the 2015 hack... but managed to acces my   account only 3 year later...?

What to do now? Can i get my accoutn back? Can i at least terminate it?",1532169402,21/07/2018 10:36:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/90ofdu/my_bitcointalk_forum_account_has_been_hacked_on/,1

Why will Bitcoin prevail in countries which strive for innovations?,"Today, with an advent of Bitcoin to the world's scene, an increased number of the traditionalist countries are faced by the choice whether to allow for continuing innovations in order to preserve their competitiveness on the international market or to slide back to the past. Here, for example, what's happening in the Lebanese Republic.  

Lebanon - the country which is notorious for its political and cultural diversities - now demonstrates a discrepancy of official opinions on Bitcoin. Not surprising, then, is the fact that this diversion of viewpoints emanates from the same respectable source - the [Banque du Liban](http://www.bdl.gov.lb/) (BDL).

The Lebanese main financial watch-dog was one of the first Middle-Eastern banking regulators which issued an official rebuke to Bitcoin as far back as December 2013. Among other gloom-and-doom remarks, the referred circular, which was quite prolifically named *""Call 900. Directed to banks and financial institutions, exchange institutions, financial intermediation institutions and the public.""*, contains the following paragraph: [: *""In order to address the risks and significant losses that may result from the use of (*](http://www.bdl.gov.lb/news/more/5/111/65)Bitcoin[*), the Banque du Liban warns against buying, holding and using such money.""*](http://www.bdl.gov.lb/news/more/5/111/65)

Since then this ""Call"" has became a battle cry of the undercover anti-Bitcoin campaign headed by the local banks. Although, doing business with Bitcoin is, formally, not prohibited by law in Lebanon, it's still impossible to link your local saving or checking accounts to any Bitcoin-trading platforms, national or otherwise. At the same time, despite their own arguments weighed in against the newly emerging electronic assets class, central banks' officials revealed (on October 2017) their plans to issue the one of their own in the following couples of years.

Among other things this startling revelation contains the following phrase (citing a secondary source): [""We understand that (](https://www.coindesk.com/banque-du-liban-digital-currency/)Bitcoin[) will play a prominent role in the future. But BDL must first make the necessary arrangement before taking this step and develop \[a\] protection system from cybercrime"".](https://www.coindesk.com/banque-du-liban-digital-currency/)

Now, the local Bitcoin community has to somehow deal with two contradictory future predicaments: the dystopian one, where their government will try to impose as stringent surveillance as possible on individuals' growing ability to access and to manage digital assets through personal electronic devices; and the other, where Lebanese authorities' natural tendency to maximize their gains from world's major technological innovations will inevitable make the new, open digital economy an integral part of Lebanese citizen's every day lives.

Business Notes for Lebanese Startups Founders:

* political climate: not friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: MENA;
* industries to focus: FinTech (notably, banking), e-commerce, marketplaces, EduTech;
* major limitations: contracting economy (GDP growth rate fell under 1%), high level of bureaucracy, dependence on foreign aid, high taxes (personal income tax is up to 21%), decreasing foreign investments, political instability caused by neighboring civil conflict in Syria;
* stimulus: service sector orientated economy, low inflation, very high fixed Internet penetration rate (80%), fast growing population of young Internet users;
* opportunities: to built an e-business aimed at MENA region.
* Bitcoin (outlook): not regulated (moderately negative).

Can't use Eclair to open channel with own LND node,"I followed the guide by u/Stadicus and everything worked fine on test net so I transferred over to MainNet.

I was having some issues with autopilot so I disabled that an I manually opened a channel with ACINQ and that worked fine.

I then went to my Eclair wallet to open a channel with ACINQ and that also worked fine.

I then created an invoice and opened it on Eclair to attempt to pay the invoice. I thought this would work as both have an open channel with Eclair (with more than enough funds to settle the invoice) so it would just use ACINQ as a hop - But the payment failed.

I am also unable to open a direct channel between Eclair wallet and my LND node and I am completely unsure why that is.

Any help would be appreciated.

"Bitcoin trading with Python - ""Bollinger Bands"" strategy analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib","Hello /r/Bitcoin! 👋

I've just released a new blog post in Medium:  👇

https://blog.rmotr.com/bitcoin-trading-with-python-bollinger-bands-strategy-analysis-b1a223385a89

It was fun to play with a big BTCUSD dataset, using some Python tools for data analysis. I hope this is useful and informative enough for all of you. Share in the comments if you have any questions or ideas to improve it.

There's a Jupyter Notebook available in Github (link in the blog post) in case you want to fork and play with it yourself.

Let me know what you think.

How will Bitcoin be sustainable?,"At a time when most of the coins will have be mined, second tier layers have been introduced to reduce transaction costs and and increase amounts, and also the price (hopefully) be higher than it is now, how will Bitcoin be sustained from then on forward? 

This question comes from the confusion of the following hypothetical situation, in which I think I'm missing a very important piece of the puzzle:

Situation as how I understand it: Miners will earn a lot less new coins from mining, and transactions costs will be much lower for users thus further decreasing profit for miners. Miners will leave the network, which causes  it to become less secure. This will increase chances of abuse like the well-feared 51% attack.

So in short, what will keep Bitcoin mining profitable and what will stop Bitcoin from imploding due to miners leaving? Proof of stake? ",1532193229,21/07/2018 17:13:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/90qu6p/how_will_bitcoin_be_sustainable/,10

I and my Russian team made a cheap Bitcoin mixer,"Hi guys!

I and my Russian team are completing the creation of a cryptomixer with high anonymity and very low commission.

Among the key features it is worth noting:

1) service fee 0.25% + transaction fee;

2) we break coins, conduct through a chain of different cryptoexchanges and send the coin to the recipient from several purses;

3) the client receives not only pure, but completely new coins;

4) support of BTC and other crypto currencies.

We hope that the low commission will attract a large audience and we will be able to keep it for a long time.

Now your opinion on the service is important to us. I will be glad to answer questions about his work and listen to comments.

Thank you for helping us to become better.

"Being blackmailed, jerk requested ransom in bitcoin, receiving address shows transactions","Hello everyone ...

  
Just as the title says ... I have received a bogus email by someone telling me that he knows my password, he got control of my desktop and camera, got all my contacts from social accounts ... That he took video of me when I was playing with myself while watching xxx web sites and that he plans to release it to my contacts if I don't pay him $3000 in bitcoin. The address he gave my for payment is:

  
 1NWEhh6PWb3GPEtQakdp2GTAMucaY1BNfJ 

  
At the time I received a message (about 4 days ago) that address showed no transactions. I was going through my unanswered emails today so I decided to check it again, in case the idiot didn't create a separate address for each mail that he sent. And there it is - he received about $1000 USD 3 days ago.

Inflation is still rising, gov increased minimum wage from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 Bs per month. 1 USD in the black market is between 3,500,000 and 4,000,000 Bs.","Hi guys, I was off some weeks, had several problems with the internet (the payment I made each month is almost zero so no maintenance), people are stealing copper wires from ADSL or power and selling them in the back market.

Government wanted to shave off 3 zeroes from the currency but had to delay that because there were no new bills, now they are thinking in shaving off 6 zeroes.

Inflation has continued increasing, while minimum wage per month is 5,000,000 Bs, one kilo of meat is around 8,000,000 Bs. One month ago was 5,000,000 Bs.

By the way, gasoline is free here in some service stations they don't require you to pay, you just fill the tank and go. One liter is 6Bs. which is 1.714285714285714e-6 USD.

One BTC trades around 25,000,000,000 Bolivares.

While government doesn't recognize officially the 3,500,000 / 4,000,000 black market exchange, they gave the authorization of Zoom (that works with Western Union) of do the exchange at 2,500,000 Bs. per USD.

I have one friend that lives in the states, he had some bills in his backpack when he left (no more than 20 bills), with his help maybe I can ship some bills, of course the main idea is to pay shipping cost and get something extra (remember, 100000 satoshis here can get me a kilo of meat, rice, pasta and beans). I already shipped with my friend some bills to https://www.reddit.com/user/Lord_Saren PM if you want to know more.",1532267683,22/07/2018 13:54:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/90xvrm/back_here_last_week_in_venezuela_localbitcoin/,1

"Just released an app that tracks Bitcoin breaking events, exchange updates\listings, social media etc in real time. Can I have some feedback?","My buddy and I spent the last couple of months designing and perfecting an app that basically tracks a bunch of stuff that are usually time-sensitive and moves price. We've been using it internally with a couple of close friends for some time, but would like some feedback from the crypto fam about what can be improved\bugs\etc. It's totally free, has no ads, and is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spekulator/id1403878272) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trontal.spekulator). Any constructive criticism\comment is welcome!

So far, we have:
- Exchange updates. This includes anything from deposit\withdrawal delays, mainnet updates, trading competitions, coin listings, etc. So far, we have Binance, Bittrex, Bithumb, Upbit, Huobi and Okex. 

- Social media monitoring. Projects usually announce milestone achievements\updates or other major news via Twitter or Medium. 

- Tether printing events. Anytime extra USDT gets printed, you'll get notified. This usually moves prices due to the new influx of cash (whether up or down). 

- Barts. I believe I speak for others when I say that it's not a pleasant experience when 30 minutes after my last refresh, I see BTC tank or do a crazy pump after my morning shower. By then, it's most probably too late to do anything.

- Other news events from reputable sites. 

We're also in the midst of implementing community-powered notifications where users can vote for an event as soon as it's received. If enough users vote for it, everyone will receive a notification (who has time to go through hundreds of feeds all day?). We currently only have a few people using it, so if you have the time to help vote, please do! 

If you find any bugs or have any feedback\suggestions\improvements, please let me know. Always looking to improve.",1532272809,22/07/2018 15:20:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/90yfx3/just_released_an_app_that_tracks_bitcoin_breaking/,1

How to solve the tax problem of digital currency,"my thoughts:

0. First need to establish a tax wallet for each country, or create it by the user himself.

1. Deduct the tax rate from the payee transaction

2. The payee specifies the country to be paid (I don't think it is necessary to confirm the nationality...)

3. Governments in different countries collect taxes and fees themselves

If you don't solve the tax problem, I think many governments have reason to suppress digital currency.",1532272829,22/07/2018 15:20:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/90yg09/how_to_solve_the_tax_problem_of_digital_currency/,1

Malicious miners - thought experiment,"WARNING: I'm going to be using Bitcoin Cash as an example, but I think it applies to any currencies with large blocks.

Let's say I'm a non-loyal mining pool who simply mines the coin which is most profitable at the time. I dislike Bitcoin Cash for whatever reason, but I still choose to mine it when it's most profitable.  
Is it theoretically possible for me to include spam (but valid) transactions in a valid block, even if they were never broadcast to the network prior? In which case, could I scatter single satoshis to millions of addresses with 0 sat/byte fees and include them in my block?

Why do developers not like ASIC machines.,"Ill admit right now, Im mostly in the dark in this, and I am also one of the miners who purchases ASIC machines.

Ive been told by a couple friends that certain coins are changing their algorithms to become ASIC resistant.

I was wondering what people are thinking about this because doesnt this just hurt both the ASIC comunity but also the GPU one aswell.  As it forces people to purchase GPU's instead to stay mining coins they want.

I know I would rather spend my money on a single ASIC then 5 Gpu's.

OPSEC: Trezor / Ledger or Glacier Protocol,"I currently use both Trezor &amp; Ledger. 

Looking for advice / experience from people who have used HW wallets AND Glacier Protocol: how did you decide when to implement Glacier Protocol vs. HW wallet? 

Glacier Protocol (https://glacierprotocol.org/) is interesting, but seems like a significant amount of work, with additional ways that user error can enter the picture. Also, there seems to me to be the possibility that the address generating scripts could be malicious in some way (ie: easily guessable address derivation schemes).

"Make push notifications useful for trading, investing and staying up to date. Tailor them to your needs!","Hello crypto fellas,

i am using a lot of reddit and twitter news for my trading decisions.


Last year i made a little python program that - when activated - sends me push notification alerts to my mobile and desktop pc for certain keywords appearing in certain subreddits/twitter feeds. This is very nice because.. you know.. a piece of information an hour sooner can be everything - and not only for daytraders.
F.e. Bloomberg twittering something about bitcoin always notifies me.


On requests i set it up for friends to also get my feed on their mobile.
Then they asked be about their own personalized feed, but it is too much for me to code everyones feed by hand.
So i decided to build a tool with nice UI that makes it easy for everyone to manage their own feed. I am sure there are all kinds of ways this could prove useful.


We are just finished with v1.0 and i am sure it's buggy as hell and you can consider it in alpha stage..
However, if you're interested, i'll be honored if you could test it for us :)
What do you think about the idea/design/.. ?
We have Twitter and Reddit.. Which social media channels should we add next?
I am happy for any feedbacks, especially constructive ones!

This will probably be unpopular to most...,"But I do not think an ETF is a good thing for bitcoin. It's ""paper"" trading of bitcoin, without actually owning the underlying asset.

It's pseudo-fiat, masquerading as a potential market boon.

The Rothschilds were behind the gold ETF several years ago, and it is always important to look at the people introducing the products, and their histories.

I do not think this is a good idea. It probably won't make any difference, probably just going to happen, but I would rather people actually trade the crypto itself.",1532315756,23/07/2018 03:15:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/913ln4/this_will_probably_be_unpopular_to_most/,1

Who accepts Bitcoin? A 2018 guide to where you can spend your bitcoins.,"Spending bitcoin has been the dream of many enthusiasts since its inception. In fact, it’s even emphasized in the very first sentence of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original[ whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

*""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.""*

It was meant to be the cash of the Internet. A safe, fast and anonymous means of paying for goods and services.

But Bitcoin’s story as a means of payment is complicated. Still, not many businesses are willing accept it for their goods or services. Even some companies that used to accept it have flip-flopped citing high fees, extreme volatility, or security risks.

Though challenges remain, there are a lot of promising features poised to help the young currency realize its true potential. From side chains that will allow millions of instantaneous, fee-free transactions per second like the Lightning Network, to specialized debit cards that allow users to spend their cryptocurrencies anywhere that accepts card, Bitcoin has a bright future.

In the meantime, however, there are still plenty of places to spend your bitcoins.

List is here: [https://amity.io/blog/who-accepts-bitcoin/](https://amity.io/blog/who-accepts-bitcoin/)",1532318035,23/07/2018 03:53:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/913u3q/who_accepts_bitcoin_a_2018_guide_to_where_you_can/,1

Incredible this is the new way in which some survive in Venezuela: Profangate graves in search of gold teeth (Photos and Video),"Due to the crisis in the country, in recent months some unscrupulous people have dedicated themselves to desecrating tombs in search of goods as garments, in other cases to use human remains for santería and in others to steal the urns where they bury the deceased .
As a way of finding food, for some individuals the practice of desecration has become habitual, since there have been cases of people who have changed a human skull for a portion of rice an incredible and shocking fact to assimilate.
For several months people who visit their loved ones who left the earth plane and were buried in cemeteries in different parts of the country, have seen how some graveyards have become a niche of anarchy and chaos, especially after the desecration of tombs and pantheons that keep the population alarmed.
Today it is surprising to go to a cemetery and observe open and looted tombs, incomplete human remains, and empty and empty urns and in some cases only the pit is seen without a coffin.
According to the testimony of some people in the morgue of Valencia, they fear sending their dead relatives to the grave, because supposedly in the city of Valencia it is common to see how heartless people open tombs, remove human remains and take the urn to repair them and market them again, leaving the remains of the corpse in a cardboard box.
Other people interviewed in the Municipal Cemetery of Valencia, assured that the tombs are desecrated for the use of works that come from the sciences and spiritualistic arts. According to points out, these are people who are dedicated to witchcraft and hidden arts that use human remains for their work.
The vandalism in the cemeteries of Venezuela is not only directly in the tombs, but also in the areas of the graveyards, criminals rob the pantheons and loaded with sheets of zinc, bars, hinges, vases and supposedly even with flowers to market them.
Relatives of the deceased are afraid to go to the cemeteries, because the underworld is unleashed. The thugs not only seek to steal the accessories with which they bury the dead, but also the properties of the living who come to visit them.
It is incredible all that an economic crisis can cause in a country the desperation of the citizens every day is more evident reaching such a way to attack the sacred as the grave of a deceased.
The largest YouTube channel in Mexico Badabun made a video about the desecration of graves in Venezuela, maybe with this you can know a little more in the world what really happens in Venezuela and what some people do to feed their families.

"Africa is open for crypto-currency, and their smartphones will do the job.","[https://medium.com/ravenprotocol/africa-could-now-be-mining-coins-with-their-smartphones-c060f76fa669](https://medium.com/ravenprotocol/africa-could-now-be-mining-coins-with-their-smartphones-c060f76fa669)

Around a billion people in Africa have no bank accounts. With most people unable to trust the government or the traditional banking system, Africans are transferring money through simple apps like M-Pesa. But, the options are limited for investments and revenue through such models. 

**When I posted this in another subreddit,** there were criticisms like Africa do not have enough power for folks to be able to mine coins. This is not about mining coins, it is about using their smartphones to get paid. Simply put, calculations for DL training models are run on the compute space of a smartphone or pc(that require explicit permission, as to how much of CPU/GPU space one is ready to spare). In return, the owners of compute space are compensated in utility tokens. It is as simple as that. Therefore, this also becomes an easy, cost-effective platform to train DL frameworks. For more on this- read [https://medium.com/ravenprotocol/hello-world-raven-protocol-f749bf5fc8cf](https://medium.com/ravenprotocol/hello-world-raven-protocol-f749bf5fc8cf)

This post is not so much about promotion or views on content, it is about more people knowing about our venture. Surely, reddit is not a space we wanna spare. 

We are already gathering a lot of responses from general folks in Africa, as well as institutions over there, that are trying to help us with the African mission. Do join us on telegram at the link below the article. 

Above all, Raven protocol is also pushing a revenue model, that cuts out the old Advertisement models.

Crappy PC and 0.44 USD per day. Is this normal?,"Hi!

I recently thought to try mining, just for fun, as I saw people are mining 0.02-0.08 USD per day with an average PC.

Now, I have middle class Gigabyte mainboard, an A10 7700K processor and a 5 yr old AMD Radeon (7790 myabe?) with 2 GB RAM. The software for mining I use is using both CPU and GPU. I measured 550 Watts with monitors on, and 390-410 monitors off (I use 2 monitors). Actually I let it run on my workplace, nobody cares, it runs in the background, so I guess among 30 PCs it will not be a big difference in the electric bill.

But how is it possible to make 0.44 USD a day?? More precise, as I'm running it now for 4 days: 0.39 to 0.44, in average about 0.42 USD. 

I know it's not much, but... why to others earn less with stronger PCs?????

An one more thing... is USB mining really better? Everybody is talking about hashes, ad gigahashes and so on, and that I shoud buy 3 of an ""XYZ"" USB miner and I'll eart 50 bucks per day... I can't believe that.

But coming back to my first question... Is that normal?

Thanks for any reply!!

Yours,

Elly",1532351294,23/07/2018 13:08:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/916wv3/crappy_pc_and_044_usd_per_day_is_this_normal/,1

Daily Market Recap - 07/23 - Will Bitcoin Clear $8k?,"![img](ciu5tzq0apb11 ""https://www.pexels.com/photo/bitcoins-and-u-s-dollar-bills-730547/"")

There’s a bullish forecast this week as Bitcoin went for as high as $7787 mark this morning in the Asian Markets before coming down to $7700 where it is currently trading right now. The market is on an upswing as the market capitalization rose to $288 Billion and the 24-hour trade volume is now at $13.7 Billion.

Although there is a possibility of a sell-off in the opposite direction, the considerable increase in volume which almost touched the $1 Billion mark across all exchanges means that the market or at least Bitcoin specifically, is quite strong as of now. Since last Monday BTC has made over 18% in gains climbing from around $6,500.

The sentiment is mixed. No one really believes this can rise but there is some FOMO thanks to the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) and the ETF agenda. If a Bitcoin ETF is approved, this could be major news for Bitcoin fans. Bitcoin could get ETF approval as early as August 16, 2018, though nothing is confirmed just yet. When ETF was introduced for gold, we saw a massive increase in the price of gold by 300%. If we saw the same increase for Bitcoin, then this would put the price per Bitcoin at $60,000, which some well-known investors are predicting.

Bitcoin increased 3.43% for the past 24 hours and slowly gaining momentum. Bitcoin price was rejected many times near the $7550 and $7580 resistance levels and went down to the $7320 level before coming back up to break the resistance. Afterward, it traded to a new weekly high above the $7650 level and tested $7700. It is now consolidating and possibly, the BTC is preparing to break the $8k barrier. The next target for buyers could be the psychological barrier at $8000. According to analysts, if that target is breached, then the price could go all the way to the $10,000 level in a very short space of time and potentially bring other coins up with it.

On the downside, the $7580 and $7500 levels are likely to hold declines in the short term.

Looking at the chart, the MACD is coming up into strength in the bullish zone. Both the RSI and SRSI are over 80 and nearing overbought. The Money Flow Index is flat above 50.

serious questions about nature of money and Bitcoin,"I'm no expert, hence my questions.

1. I know Bitcoin is ultimately a finite resource, right (21 million will ever be created)? What would be the result if a fiat currency were to be finite in that sense (i.e. from now on only X number of dollars are allowed to exist, and no further dollars will ever be printed)? Would that ""solve"" some of the monetary/financial/fiscal/socioeconomic issues that Bitcoin promises to do?

2.  What is the purpose of having bitcoins be mined over time? Why not just have the 21 million ""released into the wild all at once"" and let supply/demand govern its price?",1532356511,23/07/2018 14:35:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/917kpl/serious_questions_about_nature_of_money_and/,1

No AMZN card receipts for Paxful trades?,"Is there any vendor on paxful that will trade btc for amzn gift cards that “don’t”  have a receipt? I misplaced my receipts. I wouldn’t mind selling the cards for $0.50 on the dollar but any less than that would be ridiculous.

Should I just redeem my cards and buy an iTunes card online and try to trade that or do most vendors only accept physical cards with physical receipts? I also saw maybe I could do some wishlist buying for btc. Just wondering what the best work around here is.

Also how long is it okay to leave btc in an exchange wallet such as paxful’s? I don’t have my electrum wallet set up quite yet.",1532362463,23/07/2018 16:14:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/918elz/no_amzn_card_receipts_for_paxful_trades/,1
My contact on the asset management side is extremely confident in Bitcoin ETF approval,"There are posts talking about high confidence on the SEC side. However, I reached out to a source fairly close to the situation (not direct, but deals with them consistently) and the confidence is very high. Basically we are looking very good for 2018, but they said 100% certain by end of 2019 as there may be a few more things to iron out. They also said September more likely than August, but a delay is a good sign (just finalizing some things)

Bitcoin Theft From Calling Scam Ledger Wallet Customer Support Telephone Number On Google Search Engine,"      I'm posting this to warn others about dangers on the Internet.  I had about two-thirds of all my investments in Bitcoin.  I was unaware of all the scammers on the Internet until one stole the Bitcoins from my Coinbase account.  Ledger Wallet imposed a mandatory upgrade to their hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.  When I was following the online instructions, I was locked out of MyEtherWallet with 'Error Code 5' and didn't find the instructions on how to get around this until April 1st.  They were on the MyEtherWallet website and I could go on my account after following those instructions to find my ERC20 tokens.       Be aware that Ledger Wallet in Paris, France has no telephone support anywhere in the world.  All the listings for toll-free numbers listed on Google and other search engines are to scammers.  The following warning was posted on the Ledger Wallet Twitter Timeline March 1st, but I didn't notice it until after the theft of my Bitcoins on 3-8-18. 

[Ledger‏Verified account @LedgerHQ](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ)📷 [Mar 1](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/969171921916121088) WARNING: Ledger does NOT provide customer support over the phone. Beware the scammers impersonating the Ledger support team by using 1-888-XXXX (or others) phone numbers. Don’t give control of your computer to strangers and NEVER reveal your 24 words to anyone!    

Never search for customer support numbers on search engines.  These are unverified listings.  If a company lists no telephone support number on its real website, it means they have no telephone support and they are not required to with cryptocurrencies.  Numerous customer support scams have telephone numbers which show up on search engines.  You should never call these numbers as you will be in contact with criminals.  You can type the number itself into the search bar and will often find numerous listings as the same number is being used to impersonate customer service for more than one company.  The scammer I called wanted to remote access my computer and I allowed him to do this as I thought he worked for Ledger Wallet without knowing Google doesn't verify the telephone numbers on their search engines.  It showed up on the screen that several bugs were found on the computer which needed to be removed.  The scammer said my Bitcoins needed to be moved off my Ledger Bitcoin Wallet for my own security while he was removing the bugs he pretended to have found.  He suggested I move them onto Coinbase which I did.  When he was done with his pretend computer servicing, he said I should stay off the computer for the next twelve hours.  The next morning I went onto the Coinbase account and found the Bitcoins were gone.  They had been sent to anonymous Bitcoin addresses and could not be recovered.    

  It's gratifying to know others will benefit from reading about my mistakes, but I haven't found anyone who wants to restore the Bitcoins I lost.  I will provide my new Trezor Wallet Bitcoin address which has a zero balance at the time of this posting.  I would deeply appreciate any donations to help restore the 5.45130674 Bitcoins I had on my Ledger Wallet prior to the theft.  Please only donate if you are wealthy and have Bitcoins to spare as I will consider any Bitcoin I receive a gift.  It would help me survive this dreadful ordeal to recover the funds I lost and know I prevented others from losing much larger sums.  Feel free to pass this post on to anyone you know who owns Bitcoin.  Any donation will help.

                                           3Hq4YJu9wfr8mLbx9ePQc79nKfN7mMUoex    

I have verified this address is the same one which appears on the screen of my Trezor hardware wallet and my computer screen.  It's important to make sure these addresses are the same when you receive funds.  The address above can only receive Bitcoin.  You can test this address by sending a tiny amount of Bitcoin and posting a comment for corsicanainvestor on reddit.  I will reply as soon as I see the comment to verify the amount received and validate this Bitcoin address.  Please only send a large amount after I respond to your comment to be safe.   I will post my new Bitcoin balance as a comment under this post so readers will know when my funds have been restored.

Here's part of a message I received from customer service at MyEtherWallet.  It contains important warnings about how to avoid dangers on the Internet.    

I'm sorry for all you've been through. It seems that those funds may just be lost forever, but I can't help but hold onto hope that maybe you'll get some sort of reimbursement for all the trouble and heartache you've had. I really do wish you the best in all of this. Whenever you are curious about anything, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to try and point you in the right directions, for future reference. This crypto world is lacking in decent support, so we at MEW try to help anyone who needs questions answered, even if it is beyond our actual range of job coverage. Whatever information I have on security, I'm happy to help.    

The phishers and scammers are on the loose! Protect yourself by installing [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) or [Cryptonite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige). Never enter your private information on ANY website without verifying it is the correct website. If you give them your private key, they can &amp; will steal ALL YOUR COINS.  - MyEtherWallet    

I have added  the above mentioned Google Chrome extensions to my Google Chrome browser to protect myself from phishing websites.  They look very similar to the websites created by legitimate companies, but are run by criminals who want to trick you into providing private information so they can steal your funds.  EAL stands for EtherAddressLookup and can be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store.  MetaMask and Cryptonite by MetaCert can also be found on the Google search engine in the Chrome Web Store and I have all three.    

Here's a list of more warnings I've come up with while learning about cryptocurrency theft.  It's important to warn others about Internet dangers to prevent scams.  These warnings came at a high price to me, but I want others to benefit from my mistakes.  I hope and pray my Bitcoins will be restored through donations from grateful readers.

1. Only call a number for customer service listed on a company's real website.  Never trust listings from search engines and be certain you are on the real website and not a phishing site.  The Google Chrome extensions you need to avoid phishing sites are mentioned in the conversation I had with a customer service representative at MyEtherWallet.
2. Never allow anyone you don't trust to have your private keys to MyEtherWallet or anywhere else your funds are kept as they can and will steal all your funds.
3. Never allow a stranger to remote access your computer even if a listing on the Internet appears legitimate.  This is something scammers want to do so they can come back later to steal your funds.
4. Be aware there are multiple ways the professional thieves have devised to steal your funds.  Never trust an email is from who it appears to be from.  If there is personal account information requested, never provide it.  It's very dangerous to click on links in suspicious emails.  You could be downloading malware or visiting a phishing site.
5. Never trust a caller on the telephone is who they claim to be.  Anyone who claims to work for a legitimate company and asks for sensitive personal information likely wants to steal from you and will tell you a pack of lies to put you in an urgent state of mind.
6. Never reveal your 24 word phrase to a cryptocurrency wallet to anyone.  Keep a record of it offline where you know it's safe and never take a photograph of it or put it into an email.  Those 24 words could be used to clone your wallet and steal your funds.
7. Avoid using cryptocurrencies to make purchases online as the transactions are irreversible and you cannot dispute the charges as you can with a credit card.
8. Always be wary on the Internet and never take posts at face value.  They may not have been made by the people they are pretending to be.  The Internet is a dangerous place filled with scam artists.
9. If a company has no telephone support number to call listed on their real website, it means they don't have telephone support.  Do not look up these numbers on search engines as this is how you will come in contact with criminals who want to steal your funds.
10. Never use a hardware wallet which has already been initialized and never order one advertised as being used.  People have lost their life savings by purchasing Ledger Wallets on ebay which have scratch off cards to reveal their 24 word phrase.  This was not packaged that way by the manufacturer.  It was tampered with and repackaged by someone who wants to steal your funds.
11. Beware of scams around every corner of the Internet and never assume postings are legitimate.  They could be made by criminals impersonating real customer support people you cannot call on the telephone or expect them to make any response to your online support requests on their own website. 
12. Always verify your cryptocurrency addresses are the same on your computer screen and hardware wallet screen when you receive funds.

FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS POST ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND YOUTUBE.  YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE THE TEXT OR USE A LINK TO CORSICANAINVESTOR ON REDDIT WITH YOUR OWN DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I'VE POSTED.  MANY OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS I USED TO WATCH BEFORE THE INCIDENT I NO LONGER WATCH AS IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN SINCE MINE WERE STOLEN.  I'VE OFTEN WISHED I COULD GET BACK THAT DAY AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AS I ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN WITH MY OWN POOR JUDGMENT, BUT THIS PERSONAL TRAGEDY CAN TURN INTO SOMETHING GOOD WITH YOUR HELP. 

SHARING THIS POST ANYWHERE YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE INTEREST IN IT WOULD HELP GET THESE WARNINGS OUT TO A LARGE AUDIENCE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS ENOUGH WEALTH IN THE CRYPTOSPHERE THAT SOME WEALTHY BITCOIN HOLDERS WOULD BE GLAD TO COVER MY LOSSES IN EXCHANGE FOR MY GOOD ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT YOUR CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND OTHER FUNDS. 

PLEASE DON'T FORGET BIG NAMES SUCH AS VITALIK BUTERIN AND ROGER VER WHO BOTH HAVE A VERY LARGE FOLLOWING ON TWITTER.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS THEM ON TWITTER CAN BRING THIS TO THEIR ATTENTION TO SHARE WITH THEIR OTHER FOLLOWERS. THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WITH LARGER FOLLOWINGS WHOSE NAMES I'M LESS FAMILIAR WITH, BUT I WILL LEAVE IT TO MY REDDIT READERS TO SEE THAT THESE IMPORTANT WARNINGS ARE SHARED WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.  IF EVERYONE KNEW BETTER THAN TO FALL FOR THESE SCAMS, THEY WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO GO ON FOR YEARS.

I HAVE DOCUMENTED THIS CRIME WITH COINBASE EMAILS I SAW AFTER ALL THE BITCOINS HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM MY COINBASE ACCOUNT. I WILL COPY AND PASTE THE EVIDENCE INTO A COMMENT UNDER THIS POST. ONCE I ALLOWED THE SCAMMER TO REMOTE ACCESS THE COMPUTER AND CONVINCE ME TO STAY OFFLINE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS, HE WAS ABLE TO GO ON THE COINBASE ACCOUNT AND IMPERSONATE ME. THE AMOUNTS SENT TO THE SCAMMER'S BITCOIN ADDRESSES ADD UP TO THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF BITCOINS I HAD ON MY LEDGER WALLET PRIOR TO THE THEFT, BUT DUE TO FEES THE NUMBERS DIFFER AFTER 5.45 BITCOINS.",1532363958,23/07/2018 16:39:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/918mdm/bitcoin_theft_from_calling_scam_ledger_wallet/,1

What is Neluns and why is this project unique?,"There is a very limited amount of banking services  in the cryptocurrency market. In contrast to the traditional market, where thousands of different banks operaten within the cryptocurrency market, there exist just a few projects which provide banking services, while their possibilities are severely limited.



If market participants had access to banking services, this would positively reflect on their profits. For example, long-term investors would be able to deposit their funds and receive a premium, gaining additional profits with minimal risk levels. Lending services would allow traders and funds to increase their capital volume.



More so, if private and legal entities could execute secure cryptocurrency in just a few clicks, and easily convert them into fiat, this would attract a plethora of new participants to the cryptocurrency market



Cryptocurrency market players have access to a very limited number of financial instruments. In the traditional financial market, traders and various investment funds have access to a broad pool of derivatives, such as options, forward and futures contracts, swaps. This allows them to significantly increase their profits and hedge risks. The practically full absence of analogous financial instruments limits the possibilities of cryptoasset market participants, as well as scares away new “players”, who wants to enter this market.



The solution of all these issues can be a new project of Neluns.


Neluns offers users a broad pool of traditional banking services, aimed at quelling the financial needs of personal and corporate goals. While at the same time, we make available operations with fiat money and cryptocurrencies. Multicurrency IBAN accounts and wallets will allow our clients to execute exchange operations in just a few clicks.



Neluns mission – is to create an innovative financial ecosystem, combining  within itself a bank, which operates with fiat and cryptocurrencies, a cryptocurrency exchange and insurance company, thus, creating conditions for the quality development of the cryptocurrency market and inflow of new participants and new capital.



Compliance with all standards, provided by the Basil Committee on Banking oversight (Basil III), guarantees stable system functioning. The integration of SWIFT with payment services (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), the use of IBAN will allow users to carry out a practically unlimited spectrum of operations, including international ones. While at the same time, transaction costs are at a minimal level, transfers within the Neluns ecosystem will not bare commissions.

Question about hardware wallets,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone could give me a brief (or not brief) explanation of how a hardware wallet sets up a wallet, and how we can be sure that the companies don't know our private keys. I'm mostly curious about Ledger and Trezor. I know for example that when you set up an Opendime, you actually create a fresh wallet with totally unknown private keys, and Opendime can prove this. Do Ledger and Trezor do something similar?

Thumbs down to Coinbase. Better or similar alternatives?,"Hey yall! I am new to cryptos and made an account under Coinbase / Coinbase Pro. First, I created my account and went to verify it with my drivers license. There was a glitch and it never came back approved or denied. Just stuck at ""Verifying....."".

Cool, now I went to buy bitcoin through a bank transfer. Went to bed, woke up to two emails. One said my bank declined it, and the other that they did. I called my bank and they said they never received a request and after waiting all day, still haven't gotten a replay to my email and my account is blocked from making purchases until the other one (that was cancelled) goes through.

Has anyone considered what happens when you lend bitcoin at interest in an economy where bitcoin has completely replaced fiat currency?,"Consider this thought experiment and try to think of possible solutions to the problem. 

For those who believe that bitcoin should entirely replace fiat currency, what happens when you loan bitcoin at interest? Well immediately one would think, “sure, no problem, you just pay back your original loan plus a bit more bitcoin in interest.” Sounds fine right?

The problem is, the moment that one person lends a bitcoin and charges interest, it sets in motion a dilemma that I don’t think many people are considering right now. You have effectively created an obligation to pay back more bitcoin than will ever exist. 

Currently, this may not present as much of a problem because there is always more bitcoin being mined. What happens when we’ve mined the final coin? So now you have 21 million bitcoin in existence, no more being created and yay the government isn’t stealing our wealth by printing more money. One institution loans 100,000 bitcoin at interest to a bunch of different clients. It is to be paid back in 5 years, with a total repayment of 130,000 bitcoin. There now exists 21 million real bitcoin with 30,000 additional bitcoins needed to be paid to someone and they don’t exist. 

Surface level you may say “well, that’s okay because the people who borrowed the money will obviously make more money as a result of their loan which was used to build a business that generates income, and they can use that to pay back the loan’s interest.” Sure this may seem fine, and work for a bit, but the fact of the matter is that you still have 30,000 more bitcoin that at any point in time is owed and cannot be created. Still workable though because of the velocity of money and how it circulates. 

What happens when more loans are created? What happens when eventually, 1 million or 10 million bitcoins have been lent with interest due? What happens when the total loan obligations exceed the total amount of bitcoins in existence?

What happens if before the final coin is mined, if hey aren’t being mined fast enough to keep up with repayment obligations and it significantly slows down economic progress because no further loans can be made?

What is your solution to this potential issue?",1532378752,23/07/2018 20:45:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91atcv/has_anyone_considered_what_happens_when_you_lend/,1

Coin Ninja Adds Two More Tools to Our Toolbox,"At Coin Ninja we are dedicated to providing good sources of information and educational material to keep you up to date and educated about Bitcoin. We are also developing tools to allow you to access detailed information about Bitcoin transactions, and Bitcoin payment utility. Earlier this year we launched our [block explorer](https://coinninja.com/), added an entire Bitcoin 101 section, which teaches those new to Bitcoin all the information they’ll need to get started. 

We are now excited to tell you about two more tools we’ve added to CoinNinja.com: [Bip70 Buster](https://coinninja.com/news/bip70-buster/) and our [Bitcoin Hub](https://coinninja.com/bitcoinhub/). 

[BIP70 Buster](https://coinninja.com/news/bip70-buster/): This app forks the [DeBitPay](https://alexk111.github.io/DeBitpay/) application and allows you to view all transactional information (Bitcoin address, amount requested and intended mining fee) previously not viewable in a BIP70 payment request; like that used from any business using BitPay. You can now paste your BitPay request URL, we’ll decode it, and display all its contained information. This enables you to get the necessary information to pay a BitPay request from any wallet, even if it doesn’t support BitPay’s mandatory BIP70 protocol. For more detailed information about BIP70 Buster, [click here](https://coinninja.com/news/bip70-buster/). 

[Bitcoin Hub](https://coinninja.com/bitcoinhub/): We’ve aggregated news sources, from around the web, to help keep you in the loop within the ever-active news world of Bitcoin. In conjunction with our original blog and video content, [Bitcoin Hub](https://coinninja.com/bitcoinhub/), enables us to be your one-stop-shop for all the top Bitcoin news. 

We have much more exciting apps and tools on the way in the near future, we’ll be sure to keep you informed as they roll out.

a sincere request for help,"hello everyone.

I’ve hit some hard times, I know you’ve heard this before but let me explain. 

Three days ago, i crashed my vehicle into a barricade due to a minivan rear ending me.

I went straight to hospital via ambulance and was in critical condition.

The doctors say my back is screwed, my t11 and t12 have begun degenerating from the impact and my t6 chipped due to the pressure. I had a broken leg and three broken fingers.

The medical bills are extreme, coming in at exactly 63,059.27$

I work full time making 12$ an hour and only have 780$ too my name. I’m working on my apprenticeship to be a pipefitter.

I understand asking for donations is the wrong thing to do, I was taught from an early age that you need to work and rely on yourself - which I always have done; I have never asked for anything, until now.

Between my rent, car and insurance, I only am able to save 68$ a week for groceries. 

Again, I am truly sorry for asking anything, I am a 19 year old guy who is truly down on his luck. If I don’t pay these medical bills, and the concurrent surgery, I may be crippled within a year.

Desperation drove me to do this, as I have no other choice.

Here is my address if anyone at all is willing to help. I am in a very bad situation and just need some support to get my back fixed, my livelihood depends on it.

I thank everyone who is willing to help, any amount will help me pay off my medical bills.

"Google did not bring back crypto ads, at least not yet","Posted this elsewhere as well.

As a major advertiser and large spender, I'm very familiar with the system. The ads you may see are just old ads that haven't gone through the new filters/re-reviews yet. They were created a long time ago, got reviewed once, but haven't been re-reviewed yet.

If you try to create a new ad, it may or may not go up momentarily, or if you activate an old crypto ad it may go up momentarily until it gets re-reviewed. The roll-out for the crypto removal started several months ago and slowly has worked it's way through the system. Even though they said June, it started back in like March. It's not a quick, instant removal of all ads. It's largely an automated process that just happens when it happens.

In fact, just an hour ago I got an ad disapproval email from Google for a crypto exchange. These ads were paused a while ago and only now did it get disapproved. In theory I could have had them run, though eventually they would disappear. 6 ads were all disapproved at the exact same time today with this same reason for all of them:

Hacked over 50k stolen from binance/poloniex ill give half to whoever can get it back,"Hi yesterday someone stole 50k worth of btc/eth and sent it to this address from binance. I have no idea how he got access to my 2FA and how he was able to login to my gmail and all my passwords. I was relatively inactive and did not login to these accounts in months. He used 82.102.21.75 as the IP address I'm not sure if its a proxy or not. I have access to my email again and changed all my passwords and 2FA. I am waiting for binance to approve my reactivation, and my poloniex account is locked. (he disabled my 2fa and possibly changed it I'm talking to poloniex but they take forever to respond) 
I live in Canada and was also wondering if I can report this to the RCMP or police to see if they can investigate.

0x0609f52D143dcc2C0Ce50672d7cd4812e3D9ec6c 

I traced down most of my btc to that account and eth to this account but some of the eth in that account is not mine only the most recent eth transaction of 53.4. Poloniex did not even send me an email to confirm the transaction withdraw, but it didn't matter anyways because he bypassed my 2fa and had access to my gmail which also has 2fa.

How I sold 0.3 BTC for cash while abroad,"A week ago [I made a post asking advice on how to sell bitcoin for the local currency in cash while abroad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zi6cw/selling_bitcoin_for_cash_while_abroad/?st=jjz10e3h&amp;sh=8d75a531). I did it. The struggle is worth a post.

I don't have a bank account in this country. My bank is in my home country and my funds are very limited so I want to save it for when I need it the most. However I have a fair amount of bitcoin. I don't have a phone number here either.

Went to localbitcoin.com : Buyers for cash listed there are very few and far apart. The bidded price there is at least 15% below the current exchange rate. I tried to post my own offer but did not sign up because they asked personnal information and to confirm via text message, which I can't.

Go to the local bitcoin meetup: those meetups are only once a month, and I would need the money before. Previous meetup groups I subscribed to had rules against sellers, so I did not want to PM members and risk getting banned. I still plan to go to the meetup but I had to find another way.

Use my exchange in my home country: I am registered at a small exchange in my home country with my real ID. There would be fees to send my btc there, fees to convert it to fiat, fees to withdraw it to my bank account, and my bank will charge me fees to convert my home country fiat to the local fiat, and fees to use an ATM abroad. That is the last resort option.

Search in facebook: I only found newspapers articles. I thought people commenting those articles had an interest in bitcoin so I PMed a few of them (about 5 people). The only response I got was 'fucking scammer'. Then posted my own offer on facebook and it was automatically removed because digital currencies is in their list of prohibited items.

Craigslist: I found no post of persons willing to buy bitcoin. I published my own post. Still didn't receive any answer after a few days. I found posts of money lenders and I wrote to a few of them (5 people). I received one answer. I replied we would meet in a public place and how I want the transaction to take place. No more answer. Maybe that's best for my safety.

Local craigslist equivalent: No post of persons willing to buy bitoin. Impossible to make a post without confirmation by sms.

I went out to a bitoin ATM in the city. The ATM is only for buying bitcoin. Price is 9% higher than the current rate. I waited 45 minutes and no one showed up.

I went to another ATM. It was supposed to be at the top floor of a commercial building. I didn't find it. However a company there had the word cryptocurrency in it's name. I was wearing shorts and t-shirt. I decided to come back there the next day with nicer clothes.

I went there the next day and rang the bell. A lady answered the door. I expained I am a foreigner, I have bitcoin, and I don't know where to go. She let me come in and sat down in a meeting room. An office girl showed up and she told me in english that the lady is willing to buy, but only 20% below the exchange rate that I checked earlier that morning. I had no wifi to verify it. I told them to refer me to anyone willing to buy, we exchanged email addresses, and I walked out of the office. Luckily as I was walking out the door, the big boss was walking in at the same time, with two guys I guess he invited to some meeting. He asked the lady who I was, she told him, and he told me to come inside with him. We sat on large sofas in an open space near the cubicle workers, me, the boss, and his two guests. There was a large screen with the BTCUSD minute chart. It was going up. The lady came back to me, and offered to buy my bitcoin for cash, less than 1% below the current rate that was showing on the screen. I accepted, she generated a public address, I scanned it with my phone and sent the 0.3 BTC.

While waiting for the confirmation I asked what they do for business. I haven't got a clear answer but it looked like a tech business trying to develop some altcoin. The ladies working there who knew english and talked to me, had not much knowledge of the bitcoin technology. I explained we had to wait for the transaction to be confirmed, because many computers are working on it. The two guests listened carefully and seemed very interested in the technology.

After the first confirmation, they worried a little because the bitcoin didn't show up as confirmed on their wallet. I explained that one confirmation is sufficient for me, but maybe their wallets waits a little longer before allowing the transaction. I suppose it's actually an exchange account. I explained everyone can create wallet outside of an exchange and make transaction person to person, and the more people between, the less good it it. One of the guest made a thumb up sign and said 'Good!'.

Once it was confirmed on their part, they gave me the cash. They even counted it with a money counting machine. It is the first bitcoin she holds. It is my first successful bitcoin transaction. We took a group picture with the btcusd chart going up in the background.

I am very happy I can actually travel around the world with my bitcoin. I can't wait for the day bitcoin is adopted by enough people so we can do purchases directly with it. Person to person.

Segwit adoption has been increasing and hopefully it will help a bit, but lightning network is nowhere close to handling the potential bull run should the ETF be approved.

What do you guys think? Should we expect crazy transaction fees again?

Will it push the lightning development / adoption rate?

Interested hearing other people's opinions.",1532407681,24/07/2018 04:48:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91edvg/are_we_even_ready_for_potential_bitcoin_etf_bull/,1

"I wish the first thing I heard about bitcoin, was that it couldn't be inflated.","When I first heard about bitcoin, it was presented in passing by a coworker as internet money, or some other vague thing where my first thought was scam. That was my immediate thought because of ebay/craigslist scams etc, which wasn't unreasonable. It wasn't until I read (I don't remember where exactly) about it being peer-to-peer and solving the byzantine general's problem that I looked deeper. If someone would have just piqued my interest by saying un-inflatable currency right from the outset, I would have said ""impossible!"" and looked it up.

So my suggestion to everyone, is the first thing you bring up to someone about bitcoin, is that it cannot be inflated, which is remarkable. After that the how and why and montery history can be brought up (especially the demonetization of gold, that ship has sailed). I see so many instances of interviews etc on youtube where the first thing people say is investment or trend or anything else but what matters. Lets instead elicit that incredulous reaction that causes people to investigate on their own, from the first mention of the almighty Bitcoin.",1532411267,24/07/2018 05:47:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91eqk8/i_wish_the_first_thing_i_heard_about_bitcoin_was/,1

Bitcoin.com removing providers that do not support BCH,"Here at [bity.com](https://bity.com) , this is what we receive from [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com)

&gt;Hello,  
&gt;  
&gt;I am reaching out to you directly in regards to your exchange listing on our website [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com). At this time, we currently have you listed on our exchanges page here: [Bitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin](https://Bitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin)  
&gt;  
&gt;I am writing to let you know we have noted at this time your exchange currently does not offer Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and only offers customers the option to buy Bitcoin Core (BTC). We are making a change on our exchange listing requirements that all listed exchanges must offer Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in order to remain listed on our website. We wanted to reach out to you and let you know this so that you can start to offer Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to your customers.  
&gt;  
&gt;For exchanges that we currently list who do not meet this requirement, they will be removed from the exchange listings page and won't be offered as an option moving forward unless this requirement is met. If we don't see any changes that reflect the addition of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on your exchange within the next 30 days then your listing will be removed from [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com).  
&gt;  
&gt;Please note that [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) is one of the top most viewed websites in the cryptocurrency space with millions of views per month. You can see some of our statistics here: [Bitcoin.com/advertise](https://Bitcoin.com/advertise)  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have any questions or need more information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I will be happy to assist.  
&gt;  
&gt;Best regards,

This is our answer  to them:

&gt;Bity was notified on 12th July 2018 by [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) that if we do not offer Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for sale on our platform then we would be removed from their exchange listings page.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a response to this request, we believe we owe an explanation to our users and the broader community about why we do not currently offer, and have no immediate plans to offer, BCH on our cryptocurrency brokerage platform.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are a Swiss cryptocurrency services provider in addition to providing brokerage services. In Switzerland there is currently no economy that we are aware of which uses BCH. There are no cases of businesses being built around the direct use of BCH, unlike with Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC). There are also no salaries being paid in BCH, or companies being created to service the BCH community.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bity, as a regulated financial intermediary, currently focuses on cryptocurrencies with an actual or potential strong economy behind them. We have not seen any real use cases in Switzerland or with our user base of BCH that shows potential to be integrated in the future financial system.  
&gt;  
&gt;We acknowledge [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com)’s new exchange listing requirements and we accept that [Bity.com](https://Bity.com) will be removed from this list as we will not be offering BCH in the near future.  
&gt;  
&gt;We would also like to share that we are crypto agnostic and we understand that things can change in the future. If we see a change in market behaviour towards BCH then we would reconsider offering it on our platform.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your kind attention.",1532420124,24/07/2018 08:15:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91fisu/bitcoincom_removing_providers_that_do_not_support/,1

What to do about flash crashes?," Now that BTC is climbing fast, I'm reminded of last November. BTC was running up past $9500, and to lock in some profit I put a stop at $8500 on GDAX. On its way past $10K there was a flash-crash on the exchange, and all my BTC was automatically sold when it fell below $8500. A few minutes later it was $10,300. I had no choice but to buy back in or miss out on the fun, but I lost an immense amount of potential profit. To make matters worse it took several hours for the sell order to execute. Does anyone have advice about avoiding this kind of mishap? I have never put any auto-stops or limits on the exchanges since that happened.

Daily Market Recap - 07/24 - Bitcoin Crosses $8k In Another Short Rally,"[https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/bitcoins-and-u-s-dollar-bills-730547\/](https://i.redd.it/0csfl6sg5wb11.jpg)

 The market is high with anticipation as the Bitcoin crossed $8k today in a span of an hour and a half. We have not seen this price since May and analysts are officially calling bulls. Over the last week, Bitcoin has posted more than 20% gains with its weekly low being at around $6700. FOMO is strong with a barrage of positive news over the last week.  

While the market is seeing a more mixed picture today, Bitcoin’s recent divergence from other crypto assets has prompted CNBC trading advisor Ran NeuNer to venture that we may be on the cusp of a bull market. The analyst attributes the top coin’s strong performance to news earlier this month that the $6.3 trillion asset manager and ETF-giant BlackRock is beginning to assess potential involvement in Bitcoin. 

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $8123. Yesterday, we discussed that Bitcoin price could climb above the $8000 resistance against the USDT. The pair might correct a few points, but it remains in an uptrend towards $8500. If the price corrects lower, it is likely to find many supports like $7850. Below this, the most important support is at $7,580 (the previous resistance). A month ago saw the yearly low at $5755 and the bullish pressure was able to push the price from the resistance at $7800. While Bitcoin is still down over 50 percent from 2018’s high above $17,200 in January, its value has gained nearly 20% in a 7-day trading period.

"The 100,000 satoshi wallet","Preparing for the next halving and 2021 I would recommend setting up a bunch of separate wallets. Securing your private keys, and placing 100,000 satoshis in each one, or .00100000. I know it doesn't seem like a lot now, but come 2025 if will be worth a fortune. It's a great gift for birthday cards, to grand children or children. You can pick whatever amount you would like, but I would think making 100 wallets with 100,000 satoshis is a smart move. Be a custodian and keep a copy of the keys and instruct them not to sell or spend. I guess you wouldn't even need to give them access to the bitcoin now.

Guide: How to make use of your full node!,"I started my own full node in July last year because of the UASF movement. I knew that nodes were important for the network as a whole and that they kept miners honest, but later I found out that the most important use of full nodes actually regards the user himself. The owner of the node. How? If you run your own node you no longer need to trust anybody else to tell you if a given transaction or a block is valid. That allows you to use Bitcoin autonomously, just like it was intended to be. You no longer trust because you don`t have to. You can verify it for yourself.  

The only problem here is that you have to use your node as a wallet if you want to take advantage of the autonomy it provides. That is not very secure and it`s also definitely impractical. Mobile wallets are the way to go if you want to transact person to person.  
In this guide, I will show you how you can use your own node to be independent and autonomous without sacrificing the practicality and security of mobile or hardware wallets.  

One of the most useful tools when it comes to cryptocurrencies is the blockchain explorer. There are many such tools, but all of them are powered by a node which is not yours and therefore you have to **trust** it.  What we can do is create a block explorer powered by **our own node!** 
For this task, I used this [database-free, self-hosted Bitcoin blockchain explorer](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer).  
It uses RPC calls to communicate with your node and is fairly easy to set up.

First of all, you should have your full node set up and synched with the Bitcoin network. Make sure that you have port 8333 open and that incoming connections are allowed. For more information see [the instructions here](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node).

Once you have your node up and running you can set up the block explorer too.
In order for the explorer to work, we have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).",1532442296,24/07/2018 14:24:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91hu4i/guide_how_to_make_use_of_your_full_node/,1

One reason Bitcoin price rises can be reinforcing,"I hate to create unnecessary hype whereby people invest money they can't afford into speculative assets... BUT... 

Here's a quick explanation why when the Bitcoin price rises significantly it can have a reinforcing effect, causing it to rise even more. 

Essentially it has to do with the block subsidy, sometimes called the block reward, the miners receive. 

At the moment, miners who successfully create a valid block reward themselves with 12.5 bitcoins. 

The miner who does this is usually a mining pool, made up miners of varying sizes... some small hobby miners, some large industrial sized organisation. 

From my experience in mining, I have come to conclude that many of the smaller miners treat mining as their way to simply consistently acquire Bitcoin. They pay the electricity bill from their own wages or other income, and just slowly accumulate. 

But the larger miners don't have this luxury. They must sell some or all of their mined coins in order to pay the rent, electricity, wages etc. 

If the price per Bitcoin falls close to the cost to mine a Bitcoin, they are left with little choice but to sell nearly all their coins to pay the bills. This has the effect of putting more downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin when the price is low or close to the cost of mining a Bitcoin. 

If the price per Bitcoin is significantly higher than the cost to mine a Bitcoin, then this means the miner doesn't have to sell as many of their coins in order to cover their costs, meaning a reduced supply of new Bitcoins on the open market, meaning even greater UPWARD pressure on prices. 

It's virtually the opposite of Gold. When the price of Gold goes up, miners mine more of it and sell more of it, putting downward pressure on the price. 

But with Bitcoin, there can only ever be (at the moment) 1800 new coins per day, no matter the price. And many miners are well aware of the effect of the subsidy halving that occurs every 4 years. They know that if they can afford to hodl long term they will be far better off. 

Ultimately what happens however, is that other people see how profitable mining has become and they rush out to get some overpriced hardware and compete, reducing the profitability of mining for all involved, bringing the cost of mining a coin closer to the retail price of a coin, and increasing the % of mined coins that need to be dumped onto the market. So the effect is not a permanent one. 

Depending on what you pay for electricity, and unless there's a special super ASIC that is being kept secret right now, the cost to produce 1 Bitcoin was pretty close to $6-7k. And the mining difficulty continued to increase (meaning even more hashpower was being thrown at bitcoin) even at those prices. 

My ultimate thesis on this phenomenon is that if a significant event or large buyer/seller moves the price in any direction, it will likely have a significant flow on effect in said direction, up or down, until the next halving reduces the supply putting significant upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin.

I think I just had the most amazing business idea. Tell me what you think.,"The problem: 
You want to travel abroad with bitcoin - but it is difficult to spend, and difficult to change into the local currency. 

Solution: 
An app that introduces bitcoin sellers to bitcoin buyers (for cash in local currency). Kinda like Uber - but for exchanging bitcoin for local currency (instead of getting a ride). 

Both buyers and sellers are reviewed by other users (like Uber or Air BnB) so you can see that they are trustworthy. 

Bitcoin buyers can set their own commission on the app (depending on demand etc.) and the Bitcoin seller can choose between the different buyers (depending on location and commission). The cash part of the transaction would take place in person so the seller would have to go to the buyers' house or a designated meeting place.

For travelers, it would be more secure to travel without cash, and you would probably meet like-minded people. It could also be a back-up for people - for if they have their money stolen.

As far as I can tell, this would be perfectly legal.

I'm giving this idea away because I don't have the bandwidth to work on it. I am guessing someone here might be into it. 

I have a lot of this thought through (not the code) so if you are interested in the idea and just want some guidance - you can dm me. 

If someone becomes a billionaire from reading this and making it happen then 1. I salute you. and 2. give me some money... a million or two will do. ",1532444004,24/07/2018 14:53:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91i2k6/i_think_i_just_had_the_most_amazing_business_idea/,1

Bitcoin Bull Run - What do the Experts say?,,1532450800,24/07/2018 16:46:40,https://www.chipin.com/bitcoin-bull-run-july/,1
Bitcoin vs Diablo III Gold,"I used to run bots in Diablo III to collect gold and use to sell it on places like playerauctions.com and then when they came out with the real money auction house use to sell it on there.

At the very beginning I used to sell the gold for $30/million...  Then the next week $28/million...  eventually it was all the way down to like $1/million over the course of like 3 months.

This is INFLATION.  Because Diablo III gold was not scarce, it just kept accumulating and accumulating it just became more and more worthless.

Bitcoin on the other hand is scarce, the inflation on number of bitcoins that put into circulation every year keeps going down (technically every 4 years).  With more people wanting bitcoin and the supply going lower and lower, that is why we keep seeing the prices rise.  

I have no doubt that $8,000/bitcoin is still very low in price.  Only two thing that I can think of to break this cycle.

1. is the cryptography being broken, or a major exploit in the code being found. 

2. Some other peer-to-peer digital currency taking it's place that offers something bitcoin can't or doesn't do.",1532451021,24/07/2018 16:50:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91j3t3/bitcoin_vs_diablo_iii_gold/,1

What will a world where Bitcoin is ubiquitous look like?,"When I hear people say that we’re just now in inning 0 of Bitcoin and blockchain, I often wonder what the later innings might look like. 

I ask myself questions like: 

- What might a user interface look like so that my mother or grandmother will be able to use BTC as easily as they use their bank account?

- How will those same people who have limited tech experience securely store their life savings?

- What will banks look like and what purpose will they serve?

- This is not a question but more of a hopeful thought ... won’t it be nice when politicians and corporations are required to be transparent with their interactions? So much less corruption.

What questions do you ask yourself and, if there are any visionaries out there, how do you see a ubiquitous Bitcoin powered future?

I also host a podcast and if any Bitcoin influencers are out there and would like to bring some clarity as to the future of BTC, send me a PM ... That’s a conversation I would love to have.

Question about the book,So I've been watching the buy and sell orders because they fascinate me but I have a question. I have been seeing a lot of big buy orders in the last few days but when it comes to showing the finished buys in the book ledger I usually don't see the big buys. Let's say that I was rolling in cash and wanted to buy 35 coins like I saw yesterday at some point. My mind was spinning at figuring out how much that was in Dollars and who had that much money to throw into Bitcoin. But there isn't anyone specific that wants to sell 35 coins for that price. Do the exchanges just combine little sellers to meet that 35 coin wish? Like 60 smaller transactions so that one entity gets the 35 coins they want at that price?,1532453120,24/07/2018 17:25:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91jf32/question_about_the_book/,1

I don't understand how Bitcoin is trustless,"So I've been looking into Bitcoin lately and one of the biggest talking points seems to be that it's trustless.  That sounds great.  I can send and receive money without having to trust any individual, business, government, organization, or technology.  Well after looking into it more, that doesn't seem to be the case. 

I'm specifically looking into how to store, send, and receive it -- and it requires that you download and use a program (wallet) developed by other people.  Wait, what?  How am I not having to trust this program and these people who created it with my money?  I don't know much at all about software development, so maybe I'm missing something here, but this doesn't sound trustless. And after some more research, it turns out many of these programs/wallets have had vulnerabilities that have caused people to lose funds!  Though I don't think they were specifically Bitcoin.  But even in the case that past vulnerabilities didn't exist, is it really expected that some software developed by humans will never have bugs and vulnerabilities?

Also how is there no trust in my internet connection and computer or phone?  I'm not a computer security expert and I absolutely don't trust these these devices, my internet, and my security knowledge enough to store my wealth or transact on.  Many will say that the same applies to online banking and credit cards but I've had my credit card stolen before and it took me about half an hour of dealing with the bank to get my funds back.  With Bitcoin, in the case that your network is compromised or you lose funds to a bug in one of these programs, your funds are gone forever.  There's nothing anyone can do to help you get these funds back.  Not the developers of the program, many of whom remain anonymous, and not the police.  There's zero accountability for my wealth.  That's putting a lot of trust into this program that other people have created.

So what am I missing here?  Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies seem very obviously not trustless to me, so why does everyone claim that it is?  And if it's not, what is the value of this technology if there's still trust involved?  Why should I trust the people who create this software and technology, who provide no accountability, over current financial institutions and technology that do?

"From an article about negative interest rate, other weird fiat proposals","So, I was trying to educate myself about negative interest rates....  and the article I was in had these doozies of suggestions....  

They make my hair stand on end:

""Economists have come up with different ingenious proposals to circumvent the zero point and regain central banks’ firepower. In the 19th century, Silvio Gesell proposed a tax on holding cash. In 2009, Greg Mankiw suggested a lottery scheme for randomly picking serial numbers on bank notes and declaring them void, making it risky to hold on to cash. In 2014, Kenneth Rogoff explained that if we could just phase out cash altogether, there would be no alternative to paying a negative rate on bank deposits and bonds. And there are other proposals, too.""

From a 2016 article:  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/negative-interest-rates-absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know/

"If you are in Phoenix, AZ please show your support for Thomas Costanzo July 30, 2018 at 2 pm.","Hello Bitcoiners,

  
Thomas Costanzo *aka Morpheus Titania* has been convicted by a Jury of his peers to 5 counts of Money Laundering.Before the trial, the US government gave him a plea offer of pleading guilty for 10 years in jail. **He refused.** The government is now asking for 10 years in jail.What Thomas Costanzo case did for the community is not being publicized enough but Money Laundering has two sides. A person can be convicted of money laundering for:

1. failing to register as a money business with FinCEN, not reporting transaction in excess of $10,000, etc ... ;
2. trying to conceal the proceed of the funds.

A jury found Thomas NOT GUILTY of #1 but GUILTY of #2. This mean that thanks to him there is a precedent about trading bitcoin and not need to register as an MSB.  Hopefully the judge will refuse the US argument that he should be in jail 10 years since Sal Mansy got 1 year, Luis Ong got 20 days, Klein got probation.

  
If you are in Phoenix, AZ ... please come and show your support. [https://www.meetup.com/AbolishTheBitlicense/events/251503014/](https://www.meetup.com/AbolishTheBitlicense/events/251503014/)

Why will Bitcoin be faster adopted by small states' governments?,"A small state's government would take any opportunity to overcome country's natural handicaps. Embracing new, XXI-century digital economy, which is based on an unlimited, instant access to multiple forms of programmable credits, might help to achieve that goal. In the dog-eats-dog world of international finance some minor actors are more than willing to adapt a winning strategy, even if it threatens to undermine the existing status-quo disproportionately benefiting bigger players.

Since 2016 the [Central Bank of Lesotho](https://www.centralbank.org.ls/) (CBL) has issued nine press releases two of which (22%) bore the same peculiar name *""The emerging and growing promotion of (Bitcoin)""*. Unsurprisingly, both of them have the familiar flavor of Bitcoin-paranoia mixed with the bureaucratic over-reach. On the positive side, however, those documents have made it obvious to the public that, for the time being, CBL intends to side-track the issue of Bitcoin.

The CBL's first handout, which saw the light of the day at September 2017, confirms an unregulated status of Bitcoin in Lesotho, unequivocally stating the following: [... *The Central Bank of Lesotho hereby notifies and warns the public that it does not oversee, supervise or regulate the (*](https://www.centralbank.org.ls/images/Public_Awareness/Press_Release/Press_Release_-Bitcoin.pdf)Bitcoins[*), their systems, promoters or intermediaries. Any activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of (*](https://www.centralbank.org.ls/images/Public_Awareness/Press_Release/Press_Release_-Bitcoin.pdf)Bitcoin[*) is at the user's sole and independent risk.* ...](https://www.centralbank.org.ls/images/Public_Awareness/Press_Release/Press_Release_-Bitcoin.pdf)

Moreover, in its second release, dated back to February 2018, CBL goes as far as officially prising the digital innovations in financial industry, which is almost unprecedented for the African central bankers. In particular CBL reps said: [""... *the Bank and other institutions in the international financial regulation space, acknowledge innovation and adoption of new technologies in the financial industry thus viewing these initiatives as beneficial to the industry and its users if deployed in a manner that sufficiently safeguards the interests of the users* ... ](https://www.centralbank.org.ls/images/Public_Awareness/Press_Release/CRYPTOCURRENCY_1st__2018_PRESS_RELEASE_HALF_PG.pdf).

Now, there's a couple of questions we might ask ourselves with regards to that whole issue. One is why CBL shows such a keen interest in this topic, which other bankers, living on the same continent, prefer to either almost disregard or to completely dismiss? Second is why CBL finds its necessary to commend the Bitcoin revolution, while it threatens to undermine the very fundamentals of central banking itself?

Steering clear of exhausting and lengthy answers to both of those questions, it suffices to mention that Mosotho (country's official demonym) territory (30.4 th km2), population (2.2 mln) and economy ($2.7 bln) are unusually small for an African state, which puts it at the significant competitive disadvantage. Bitcoin could help Lesotho to even the odds in the unfair game, which big economies always play against smaller ones. 

Two above mentioned CBL's media releases might just have slightly opened for us a small window on the cell door of Mosotho ""real politic"" to peek at what is really going on behind the official government facade. 

Business Notes for Mosotho Startups Founders:

* political climate: not friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: South Africa;
* industries to focus: FinTech, e-commerce (real estate);
* major limitations: small, slowing economy (GDP growth rate is under 3% and falling, GDP is about $2.7 billion), small size of population (slightly over 2 million), high legal, tax and administrative barriers to SME (f.e. an personal income tax rate stands at 30%), the great majority of local potential users is living in poor rural areas, prevalence of subsistence agriculture, low fixed Internet penetration rate (20%);
* stimulus: close economic ties with South Africa;
* opportunities: to develop e-businesses aimed at the South African market.
* Bitcoin (outlook): not regulated (moderately positive).

[serious] How exactly can cryptocurrency help Puerto Rico?,"Puerto Rico has seen an influx of bitcoin entrepreneurs over the last couple years, particularly after the hurricane. Seeing this is a bitcoin sub, you might have seen the headlines, but [here's a recent one for reference](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-24/bitcoin-billionaire-brock-pierce-wants-to-transform-puerto-rico/10013026).

One of the cryptocurrency investors that is making moves in Puerto Rico is billionaire Brock Pierce, who claims he wants to turn Puerto Rico into a hub of innovation by establishing a crypto-currency based city on the island. He and other in his group describe themselves as ""benevolent capitalists trying to build a benevolent economy"" on the island, and claim their goal is to help Puerto Rico grow and prosper via cryptocurrency. Locals are divided on the issue. Some are welcoming them as investors; but most seem to be wary of them, describing them as ""disaster capitalists"" and ""vulture capitalists"" taking advantage of Puerto Rico's woes. Many locals claim these people are only here to avoid paying taxes in the mainland, and in truth have very little interest in helping local Puerto Ricans prosper. 

Out of all the articles I've read, it seems like Brock Pierce and others keep emphasizing how much they want to help the island, but do not provide much substance as to how exactly their project is going to benefit the locals. Now, I'm not much a crypto expert, so maybe some of you can give your opinions on the subject.",1532471303,24/07/2018 22:28:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91m2qw/serious_how_exactly_can_cryptocurrency_help/,1

Try Bitcoin Training Before Bitcoin Trading,"Hello Kids,  


I want to introduce you to something that has been needed in the space for a while, meanwhile exchanges are busy making money from people, they forget how important is to education part of it. If we want crypto to grow, we have to dedicate energy into creating user friendly ecosystem to allow newcomers to learn before getting their hand on Bitcoin. I want to introduce [Niffler.co](https://Niffler.co) \- first simulated/sandbox crypto exchange where you can follow other people trades and practice trading and learn about hazards in the space without risking real capital.

  
This is quick quote from InTheMesh....

&gt;Niffler.co will be a safe place for newbies to practice trading and get pointers from people with proven track records. Users will trade fake money and their mock investments will follow real-time values on a simulated exchange, giving them a handle on the process without risking real money. Aspiring trainers on Niffler.co will first have to demonstrate their own know-how by participating in the platform as well, publicly sharing with the community the basis for their decision to buy or sell. Gamification is fundamental to the design, and a leaderboard and periodic challenges (with rewards in real money) will help to sort the crowd. Those whose investments perform well will eventually be granted “trader” status, meaning they can sell subscription training services to followers at rates they set themselves, with Niffler.co taking a 5% cut.

Do you agree that there is very little education coming from exchanges, bitcoin ATM providers on how to keep your bitcoin safe or explaining how volatile the market is and why?

Bitcoin ATM recommendations? Which provider is the best?,"Firstly, I fully understand that for the vast majority of users here, bitcoin ATMs are not the best method for exchange. What I'm looking for here is, if you did have to rely on an ATM.

Say I'm looking to add a bitcoin ATM to my convenience store, both for the community to use and for my own profit. Which company would you recommended, provided I'm looking for the following features:

1. Ease of use and support - I'm not an engineer so I need it to just work, or I need to be able to get tech support or at least help from the online community.

2. Privacy and availability - a primary use will probably be to send remittances to Mexico and Central America. Many users may not have bank accounts or proper identification, or may prefer not to be identified. Phone number verification is probably fine. Other users will probably be gamblers and speculators but will still prefer to avoid lengthy verification processes.

3. Sustainability - I cannot afford to pay for this thing and I can't guarantee and certain volume of use. I don't need to make large profits but I need something where my business agreement keeps me in the black regardless how much or little use it gets.

Of course low fees is important as well, but only after these items are fulfilled. Thanks in advance for the help.",1532476180,24/07/2018 23:49:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91mpj9/bitcoin_atm_recommendations_which_provider_is_the/,1

Getting started with bitcoin,"Hello 
I have been thinking of purchasing some bitcoin..

I work in a local coffeeshop and fortunately our store has a bitcoin atm.

I was thinking of using my tip money to purchase each week ( since I get my tip every week in cash)

1. Should I buy bitcoin using an atm vs purchasing through exchanges like coinbase?

2. I dont currently have a wallet but the atm qr code linked me to an app called bitWallet will this app be secure enough?

It is hard to stop talking about Crypto with people who don't care D:,"Man I wish I had friends locally that actually cared about crypto or was at least interested in it. I try and talk to some people about it and let them know about the awesome news coming for the market and no one seems to care. I see a HUGE opportunity with this market and wish more people were aware of it.. I'm excited about the market and it amazes me how many people don't really know about the market at all or instantly think it is a scam. There have been a few people that I have talked to that were interested enough for me to walk them through the process of obtaining the coins and gave a pretty easy run down they instantly just say screw that it is way too complicated. I have been in the market for awhile so I tend to forget the steep learning curve when it comes to crypto.. so I can see where they are coming from, however I think it is worth the effort to learn.I don't obsess over crypto, but it is fun to stay up to date with what is going on in the market and different moves that are being made.. I really just want someone locally that I can get hype as hell with when the market swings upwards, so i have someone else to sit on the top with.(If the massive gains ever come..lol)I guess I'm just going to have to shut up about crypto and just enjoy the possible huge gains I may receive in the future.  I'm sure when the market rebounds and everyone is interested again, those same people will come flocking back asking how set things up.  Anyways just a little rant, going to go back to playing some Overwatch, Hammond is fun as fuck to play.                                                                                TL:DR: Why no one care about crypto? I try to help people become aware of the market but no one cares anyways.

Mom has cancer. Request for help,"Good afternoon, Friends!

My name is Vyacheslav. I'm from Ukraine. I appeal to you for help.

At my mum - a cancer of an intestine. Over the past three years, she underwent 2 surgeries and chemotherapy.

Now we need another chemotherapy, but we absolutely do not have any money for it.

They say charity is easier to implement in bitcoin. 

12URgW26mCrDr7AFqw1CC4woPyDqmPt7qF

We will be very grateful to any amount of financial assistance!

Upon your request, I am ready to send all the documents confirming my mother's illness. One problem is that they are written in Ukrainian.

Thank you for your attention and support!

You have a big heart, friends!",1532504255,25/07/2018 07:37:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91prp5/mom_has_cancer_request_for_help/,1

Bitcoin price prediction: more upside to be seen?,"**Bitcoin** **is trading at $8,302, up 4% from yesterday.**  Bitcoin price broke the key resistance against the US Dollar at $8,000.  On the hourly chart of BTC vs. USD, we find a key connecting bullish trend line with a support level at $8,250.

All About Vaping,"Here's a straightforward inquiry I get asked a considerable measure: ""What is the best online vape store?"" 

Also, well, it's an intense inquiry to reply. 

You see... 

There isn't generally any one best vape shop — there are parcels and heaps of awesome vape shops on the web, and I never restrict myself to buying from only one.  

Before you read the rundown I need to include this disclaimer: this is a considerable rundown yet there's still no chance it can cover all the immense online vape shops. This rundown is basically a decent place to begin in case you're searching for reliable online vape stores offering reasonable costs on quality items.

I'm Venezuelan, Mechanical Engineer, and my salary at the oil company here is $2 a Month + a box of Food.

Luckily I've always been a fan of Bitcoin and the BlockChain technology, I spend my spare time teaching people how to change their Bolivares to Crypto so the inflation doesn't wreck their money. 

So far I've helped many business and just old people i.e: Restaurant owners who try to sell dishes everyday and the next they they're trying to buy some meat there's no profit, because inflation hits us so hard. Right now the inflation is 1.000.000%++. I'm looking forward to a plan help people get food through Crypto as well I need a plan and the logistics first, I'm pretty much focused on training on Bitcoin use and saving whoever I can from Hyperinflation. 

Anyhow, you guys can ask anything about how we live here, why we got here, how could we get out, and whatever. There are so many stories to tell. ",1532519019,25/07/2018 11:43:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91r3eg/ama_venezuela/,1

Dail Market Recap - 07/25 - Bitcoin Still Dominating the Markets,"https://i.redd.it/olyi17e2d3c11.jpg

The middle week is pushing into more good news as Bitcoin continues to push and test new boundaries. For the past days, we’ve been seeing new monthly highs, topping May prices. Already, far-seeing analysts are looking into a positive start for August and what prices it would bring.

The Bitcoin rally is slowing down today but our market capitalization has breached $300 Billion -a high not seen since June, before coming down to $296.7 Billion. Total trade volume for the past 24 hours has risen from $17 Billion to $20 Billion. The crypto markets are 18% higher than this time last month. Bitcoin has reached a very steady rate of climb that it has held for a number of days now. Bitcoins dominance is now at 47.3%.

As mentioned, Bitcoin’s performance seems to be slowing down but today’s gain is still higher than its pre bull prices. Currently, it is trading at $8257, and has posted 1.29% growth for the past 24 hours. BTC reached a top of $8425 a few hours ago before pulling back to $8200.  

If it goes back up, the resistance is waiting at the $8650 level. It has to clear  $8500 zone before it could accelerate gains. Should it go downwards below $8200, the nest support is at $8150.

Looking at the chart, the 4-hour MACD is coming down from the bull zone, the green RSI, the yellow  SRSI, and the Money Flow Index are all sharply coming down indicating that bulls might be taking a break after the climb to $8400.

First impressions of HoneyMiner,"After reading the article on CoinDesk yesterday regarding HoneyMiner, I tried it out. For those who haven't heard of it, it is a program for PC's (iOS coming later) that will autodetect your hardware and mine the coin most advantageous to your hardware. It automatically converts that coin into satoshis. The interface is pretty straight forward with plenty of options--you can enable/disable GPU and CPU's, task it to only run when the computer is idle, etc. On my desktop, it uses 3 out of the 4 cores and scales down if I do anything intensive. Its pretty smooth.

What I like the most about it, and programs like it, is that they are going to make it so easy and attractive for noobs to get into crypto--specifically BTC. No tweeking config files or digging around github. I can only mine about 12 cents worth of Satoshis per day on my several year old gaming rig (with GPU disabled, around 30 cents with GPU enabled), but I would guess a newer computer could get a quarter to fifty cents worth, a new gaming rig, probably more. Young people, tweens, teens and strapped college students are going to run this thing constantly. And perhaps even more importantly, it will train people to think in Satoshis. Anyhow, the fees kinda suck and I had to disable GPU on my laptop or it would crash (probably because integrated chips are a pain in the ass). But it seems like they are actively developing it and adding features. Best of luck to them!

Anyhow, I see this sort of plug-n-play program to be bullish for BTC in general. If you want to make me rich, a few satoshis at a time, I shamelessly offer this referral link.

Skyrocketing Price of Bitcoin Leads To The Next Big Bull Run,"The world of cryptocurrency is always fascinating with new things as it is still at nascent stage. Bitcoin the most popular cryptocurrency is now taking the internet by storm  because of the surge in the price of Bitcoin this July 2018. 

**The next big bull run**

![img](5t2uuv2hn3c11 ""Data source: Coindesk"")

The Bitcoin price has reached $8000 mark for the first time after two months, paving way for the next bull run. The current value of Bitcoin is still a long way off its 2017 peak- $2000. Market experts do caution Bitcoin is experiencing a classic financial bubble. At this juncture, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve the Bitcoin ETF(exchange-traded fund). The first Bitcoin EFT approval from SEC could bring a significant boost to the crypto market. Bitcoin's market capitalization dominance has also improved significantly. 

**Google Trends**

![img](vwwysg7kn3c11)

Bitcoin ETF is trending now on Google due to the massive bullishness of the Bitcoin. The search term ""Bitcoin EFT"" is showing a steady uptrend in the United States and Worldwide. This clearly shows that people are eagerly waiting for the ETF approval from the SEC. Many crypto enthusiasts stated that Bitcoin would become the currency of the future. 

**Bottomline**

Market analyst, Mati Greenspan, stated that *""We might just be on the cusp of the largest bitcoin bull run in history"".*

The future of Bitcoin looks bright and the price hike of the Bitcoin will cause huge waves in the crypto market in short term as it seems due to ETFs and Institutional Money taking Bitcoin seriously.",1532526865,25/07/2018 13:54:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91s0x7/skyrocketing_price_of_bitcoin_leads_to_the_next/,1

Suspicious email from DOJ regarding Poloniex,"   
Hi everyone, I received a very strange email yesterday, seemingly from someone in the Delaware Department of Justice.  What is alarming is not the content of the email (even though it could be spam) but the fact that 400 Poloniex account holders' email addresses are included in the CC field (I recognize some of the email addresses as real people).  So this begs the question... is this some sort of scam?  If so, how did they get all of these email addresses?  And if this is not a scam, is this just stupidity on the DOJ employee's part?   ( and then he tried to recall the message this morning, probably after realizing he didn't Bcc..)

Question about the bitcoin protocol,"I am currently learning stuff about the blockchain and am struggling with one question: 

Nodes go through a verification process and in order to do that, they verify the entire blockchain. The result of that verification process is a state that lists all of the accounts with balances on them.

Here comes my question: This state must be stored somewhere (I assume in memory). Isn't it a big problem if one malicious attacker spams billions and billions of newly generated, previously empty addresses with 1 satoshi? I know, that is expensive.

Please point out flaws in my thoughtprocess, and tell me if I got something wrong. Also if there is any ressource about how this state is actually built, I'd be very thankful!",1532531427,25/07/2018 15:10:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91so32/question_about_the_bitcoin_protocol/,1

Employee mined 500 000 BTC on company's POS-terminals back in 2011,"The security service of the company drew attention to the fact that at night the terminals transmitted information, and their load increased.

It took three months to find the ""culprit"" of the events. As it turned out, the technical director of Qiwi installed  applications for mining bitcoins on the POS-terminals.

Director of Qiwi demanded the return of the bitcoins, arguing that the resources of the company were used for their extraction. But the miner left without ever following his request. His fate remains unknown.

According to Sergei Solonin, the company did not incur direct losses from the activities of the ex-employee. However, tenants of terminals that paid for electricity could suffer.

After exposing Qiwi employee, Solonin ordered to mine at all the company's terminals. However, the idea could not be realized, since by the time of restoration of the applications, the process of mining bitcoins became complicated and the terminals simply could not cope with this task.

We note that, as of July 25, the value of the mined bitcoins by the Qiwi employee is over $ 4 billion.",1532537347,25/07/2018 16:49:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91tjfw/employee_mined_500_000_btc_on_companys/,1

Receiving donations securely and anonymously for a hobby project?,"Hi, I'm (really) new to crypto. I host a service for free and people are asking for a way to donate but I don't want to be doxxed. What I need:

* Receive funds anonymously: only the crypto service should be able to see my personal information, people who donate would not see anything.
* Be able to receive bitcoin but also as many forms of donation as possible, and other crypto coins. Even better if people can also donate using PayPal or their cc and I receive crypto.

Is coinbase a good idea? They don't officially support my country so I'm not sure how I would ""convert"" the money to PayPal or my bank account.",1532543368,25/07/2018 18:29:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91ug7j/receiving_donations_securely_and_anonymously_for/,1

How 24 hours volume is calculated on trading plateform,"Hi,

I know that volume is the number of BTC or altcoin sold or bought in the period of 24 hours.

But something not logical here.

For example:
I sell 1000 BTC, and someone buy it, the volume under 24 hours is 1000 BTC right now.
What if the buyer of 1000 BTC resell them (The same BTC i sold)?

So 24hours volume will be: 2000 BTC ?
It supposed to be 1000 BTC since only 1000 BTC circulating.


If not, how the volume is calculate exactly ? How trading plateform track BTC if they are sold already or not etc ...

Is it a good time to start buying bitcoins?,"Im a newbie both in this forum and the cryptocurrency subject, so I had been reading a lot and studying in the last couple weeks.But I still have some doubts. I always see people saying that there is a bubble in the bitcoin market and that there are many people who own big ammounts of bitcoins and can manipulate the market, so i dont know if now its a good time for a person who doesnt own any bitcoins yet to start buying then (i planned to hold them for a long time, not trading beetwenn exchanges) or if i should wait more. I also see fear about corrections and dont know well how those work and if they have an specific time to happen.

Best way to buy BTC monthly as investment for daughter,"Hi all, 

I'm going to start buying a small amount of BTC monthly for my 1 year old daughter. I was planning on using Coinbase Pro because it seems like I can do the entire transaction without fees (Free transfer to fund from bank account&gt;free market maker order&gt;free transfer to hardware wallet) but I'd rather not to support Coinbase so... I'm curious what other people would recommend? 

Ideally the transaction would be very low cost, set it and forget it, and enable me to move the BTC to my own wallet. It's a relatively small amount though so I'm open to leaving it online with an insured and reputable service like maybe Square or Circle. 

What do you think?

Coinbase and Abra are big let downs...,"Hey all! I posted about my issue with Coinbase a few days back. Basically my transaction was cancelled through Bitcoin for ""Security issues"". They said it was an error on their end and there would be no problems moving forward. Problem is, I have to wait for an account specialist to have my account unblocked from making transactions with takes over a week due to being understaffed.

I decided to send money to my coinbase account via bank to my USD account while I wait for my account to have exchange privileges turned back on and as a backup I made an account on Abra.

Well, again my deposit on Coinbase
was denied for security reasons hours after I originally made the transaction, and I was emailed by Ryan from Abra that I won't be able to make transactions through Abra (I've heard many complain about this. Seems suspicious)

Anywho, your boy just wants to buy some Bitcoin and I keep getting f****d with every move I make. My original transaction was $800 less than the current price.

I heard of Local Bitcoin but didn't really want to pay the premium and then the cost to move it. Anyone else have another exchange or platform to recommend?

from a reference price of 7050.5 EURO it should rise 1.7915% so it should get 7172,14 EURO. 

The spread between the highest  and lowest price should be 9,415%, so 6733,25 EURO the lowest , and 7368,13 the Highest.

The prices above should be considered simply indicative numbers!

The first prediction was WRONG! you can check it in my profile I posted few days ago!

This is not a financial advice the program is still in alpha, and more likely WRONG!",1532560727,25/07/2018 23:18:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91wy0g/new_price_prediction_from_my_program/,1

de future ft future,"Anyone else feel as though bitcoin (in its final form) could be a major digital currency, while Smart contracts, digital identity and assets may end up individually managed by government or companies for regulatory purposes.

I mean adoption of virtual currency is one thing, but adopting projects as a nation seams kind of unfounded. 

If say any country wanted to implement block-chain based infrastructure, either A) regulation of existing projects would be active, or B) government/communities would implement their own.

I honestly don't see block-chain being a tech that the average citizen would need to hold ""tokens"" in order to access its facilities. 

They may need to pay for the service yes, but I believe the tokenisation part will be in the back end as a bridge or medium for delivering data.

Token exchange with privacy is now possible on Bitcoin,"Last night [XCredits](https://xcredits.com/) successfully demonstrated using XSPOCT to do arbitrary asset token exchange on Bitcoin, with full anonymity and the full security of the Bitcoin blockchain. We previously demonstrated ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYigaenwuGU) &amp; [whitepaper](https://medium.com/xcredits/xcredits-style-private-off-chain-transactions-xspoct-b8db5603a703)) that you can use the XSPOCT Note system to transfer burnt Bitcoin between individuals in a completely private yet secure way.

# How we did it

We generated a pretend token “FakeUSD”, issued by “Fake Bank”, where the Fake Bank generated $40,000,000 in tokens redeemable for USD at a Fake bank branch.

https://i.redd.it/j620h3gyz6c11.png

Alice then creates a burn transaction which establishes that she is creating an XSPOCT Note for this asset. The output address of the transaction is a burn address. In this burn address we are establishing:

1. What token is being created
2. Which address to look at to establish what the next transaction is.

[Process for hashing information in the initial burn](https://i.redd.it/1v2ynuy407c11.png)

Alice then sent Bob $20,000 USD by:

1. Asking Bob to send the hash of his instructions for the next transaction, then
2. Generating output information, and
3. Sending a transaction from address ‘2xxx’ to the burn address generated by hashing the outputs.

In a similar way, Bob sent Charlie $20,000 USD .

[Transferring the token between parties involves generating hashed output addresses which can prove where to look for the next transaction.](https://i.redd.it/vfs6ml0907c11.png)

This is a huge step forward for Bitcoin and the crypto community in general, as tokens can now be generated and traded on Bitcoin. It provides another method for external parties (like banks) to interact directly with the blockchain.

XSPOCT Asset tokens do not require a change to Bitcoin or a separate chain. It uses Bitcoin as the backbone infrastructure.

This is only a proof of concept, and there is a fair bit of work to do in building the validator, and a usable interface for users.

We’ve open sourced the code [on Github](https://github.com/xcredits/xspoct). Check out:

* The ‘xspoct.js’ library,
* The creation of an XSPOCT for sending assets using ‘create-and-send-xspoct.js’ and
* The creation of an XSPOCT for Bitcoin transactoin in the file ‘create-and-send-xspoct.js’.",1532567461,26/07/2018 01:11:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91xswc/token_exchange_with_privacy_is_now_possible_on/,1

Dissimilar to direct investments on cryptocurrency exchange platforms, issuers of a bitcoin ETF are responsible for protecting the funds of investors and insuring them, as a trusted intermediary. Hence, investors who previously were reluctant towards investing in the cryptocurrency sector due to security and compliance concerns, will likely invest in the cryptocurrency market through ETFs.

EXPECTATION has value as a currency,"This coin is worth more than the others because people THINK it is. They EXPECT it to be. 

The most important things in the world are worth only what people will pay for them. 

If you can raise someone’s expectation... if you can make them NEED something... that is the source of wealth. 

Owning things of value is secondary to creating things of value where none once existed.

"As someone only invested in BitCoin, is it wise to put some money into Bcash?","All my money is currently in BitCoin. I figure, if governments, banks, and companies are moving into crypto, it's probably too big to fail cause everyone is invested in it, and so it can only go up long term.

(DISCUSSION Thread) Warren Buffett on Bitcoin. Thoughts?,"[Warren Buffett on Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtITDtZPYEw)  


Coming a bit late on the whole cryptocurrency I would like the constructive discussion of the community about one of the biggest icons in the financial sector's take on Btc.   


For me personally as an investor, cryptocurrency that one day can act as an additional real currency other than the ones we have tied to their respective countries, while also the possibility of the proliferation of crypto into consumer areas (buying and selling goods) is a real value that such an asset has.  


 However, the man being the man who he is, the pinnacle of value investing in short term contemporary era sees none of it. It puzzles me why. Would it be because there is only a finite amount? What would he possibly see that we can't?

The post was removed 'because it doesn't meet the quality standards for /r/Bitcoin at this time.'. Fine. /r/Bitcoin modding is arbitrary on the best of days. People asked for proof. Here, have some. Liked tweets by Szabo:

Europe has proven that gun control creates safe societies with some of the lowest murder rates in the world. Meanwhile, America is a shitshow when it comes to crime and gun-related deaths. Where does a pro-gun stance out of fear for your government lead? We should all be allowed to have our own bombs? The patriotic, gun-slinging Szabo seems entirely unaware of his highly flawed reasoning in this area. Why support of Trump and Russia forever stains your character needs no explanation.

There is plenty more to be found. I should not have to provide a comprehensive list of tweets, just [scroll through his 'liked' history](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/likes).

Could the trade war between the US and China be causing Bitcoin's price increase?," There are rumors on the Internet that the retreat in the yuan (Renminbi), caused by the US-China trade war, would be causing the Chinese to buy large volumes of Bitcoins to prevent devaluation of their financial resources. Is there any logic to this?  


Há boatos na internet de que o recuo na cotação do yuan (Renminbi), causado pela guerra comercial entre EUA e China, estaria levando os chineses a comprar grandes volumes de Bitcoins para prevenir a desvalorização dos seus recursos financeiros. Há alguma lógica nisto?

What could be the next Crypto currency that might be a medium of exchange?,"Ok so Bitcoin is great! it will be the next digital gold (gold 2.0) a great tore of value with only 21M coins.

But when will the revolution reach the medium of exchange sector? When will a crypto currency replace FIAT?

  What is needed in order for that to happen? some ppl say LN (lightning network) will help, and that the issue is scalelabilty. 

I think it is in the monetary system. ppl will prefer to HODL the BTC , and use the USD to buy stuff.

Bitcoin Meetups: Feedback (worldwide),"I'm interested to get some feedback about the quality of Bitcoin meetups you've been to, worldwide. 

I help out with organizing the Seoul Bitcoin meetup which has a really under appreciated organizer in u/RubenSomsen who dedicates a a lot of his time toward helping absolutely anyone understand Bitcoin's technology and how it works. With such a great experience here in Korea, I'm really interested in knowing about other meetups.

1. When (year? month?) did you go to a Bitcoin meetup?
2. Where was the Bitcoin meetup? 
3. Does it still exist? (does it have a website or twitter you can link to?)
4. What was it all about? Bitcoin tech? Trading? Other?
5. What was the best thing about it?
6. What was the worst thing about it?
7. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being an incredible meetup and 1 being a horrible meetup), what score would you give it?

And any other comments you want to share would be awesome. Or if you have questions about the Seoul Bitcoin meetup, feel free to ask.

BTC ETF Disapproved - What Now?,"Well, I guess this is the end of BTC, everybody will sell and forget about the coin right?

Wrong, last time this happened was in March 2017. A tiny dip followed it as weak hands sold off. Just look what happened a few months after to the price of BTC. Time and time again shows those with strong hands who hold seeing the bigger picture are the ones who succeed. 

Yeah, that's right, if you sell at this point after all we have been through it's almost foolish. I read the paper put out by the SEC and the primary reason the ETF got disapproved was because they still feel there is not enough liquidity with primary risks being a centralized exchanges could halt (most liquidity generally relies on having exchanges currently) or the risk of a central exchange using not public material to fraudulently manipulate the price. Each and every day we grow with more users, more exchanges, and a tiny setback means nothing in the long term. All I ask is see the bigger picture and don't buy into the FUD or FOMO ever.

TL-DR: A BTC ETF failed once before and this 2nd time does not mean anything significant for the bigger picture and Bitcoin's future!",1532644691,26/07/2018 22:38:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/926yng/btc_etf_disapproved_what_now/,1

The SEC will have 2 new commissioners (out of 5) by the end of this year. Big chance for a change of opinion on ETF approval for next year (or earlier).,"One commissioner, Michael Piwowar, just stepped down this month and another, Kara Stein, is currently overstaying their current term which ended June 2017 (they are allowed to overstay for 18 months if their replacement has not been approved). The dissenting commissioner, Hester M. Peirce, who thought that the Bitcoin ETF should have been approved, will be on the commission until at least June 2020.

From looking at the SEC website, drafting an official decent is VERY RARE. Plus, considering that the VanEck ETF has such a high share price, it truly is only for accredited investors, which are normally given leeway when it comes to risky investments.

I would say that this disapproval truly has no bearing on the VanEck ETF decision. ",1532646525,26/07/2018 23:08:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/92778t/the_sec_will_have_2_new_commissioners_out_of_5_by/,1

As of March 31, 2018, the average number of bitcoins traded in the Gemini Auction on a business day was just 178.07 bitcoins over the previous month, 122.20 bitcoins over the previous three months, and 138.46 bitcoins over the previous six months.  Median volume figures for the same periods are even lower: 146.51 bitcoins, 85.09 bitcoins, and 90.42 bitcoins, respectively""

""This means ""creation or redemption activity would substantially affect the Gemini Auction price ""Given the small size of the Gemini Auction relative to the size of a creation unit, the launch of the proposed ETP would be likely to fundamentally affect supply and demand in the Gemini Auction, and the use of the Gemini Auction price to calculate NAV would introduce a significant incentive to manipulate the Gemini Auction that does not currently exist""

NiceHash Review: Bitcoin Cloud Mining,"Renting hashing power online is a great way to start mining cryptocurrencies without having to make the investment in mining equipment. So which one ranks among the most [trusted cloud mining sites](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864)?

This site allows you to buy hashing power for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Dash, Zcash, Litecoin and other coins and get paid in bitcoin. There's no contracts so if mining doesn't turn a profit for you, you can immediately stop your investment.

[NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864) has real miners who use their own mining equipment which is connected to the site's multipool so you'll never have to worry if the mining equipment actually exists.

### Buy and Sell Hashing Power‎

So if you want to start cryptocurrency mining but you've been hesitant because of shady cloud mining services, this is the solution that you've been looking for.

You'll get access to a host of user-friendly features for buyers including:

A minimum order price of 0.005 Bitcoin for every algorithm  
No contracts, no risk. You may cancel at any time without a cancellation fee  
Only pay only for valid shares  
Mine on any pool you want, when you want  
Get access to real-time statistics &amp; dashboard

The best part about cloud mining sites is that unlike actual bitcoin mining, you don't have to spend weeks learning about mining hardware and software in order to get everything set up. In fact, with this site you can actually be up and running in just a few minutes.

Getting started in this site is easy. All you need to do is:

1. Register a new account and deposit BTC.  
2. Add the mining pool you want to direct your purchased hashing power to.  
3. Set the fixed price or bid for mining and then create a new order.  
4. Monitor your order on the marketplace.

Another reason to consider cryptocurrency cloud mining is the fact that you can time your entry so that you can make the most of your investments. Getting in on cryptocurrency cloud mining while bitcoin prices are low means better returns later on versus having to invest in expensive mining hardware upfront.

So if you just want to learn how it works and place some initial orders, you can sign up for free to check it out for yourself.

[Click here](https://www.nicehash.com/buy?refby=686864) to join and you'll also get a free guide to buying hashing power with tips on efficient mining. ",1532653219,27/07/2018 01:00:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/928112/nicehash_review_bitcoin_cloud_mining/,1

How can I invest now that my country has banned banks from dealing in Crypto Currencies?,"Hi!

India has banned banks from dealing in Crypto Currencies. Some banks are closing people's account who bought cryptos in the recent past. Now, it seems to me that there is no way to buy crypto with my money (INR / Feat).

I want to invest around $1,000 so buying a mining gig is not my solution.

Is there any other way for me to buy Bitcoin or to earn it somehow?

Thank you",1532665548,27/07/2018 04:25:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/929f3s/how_can_i_invest_now_that_my_country_has_banned/,1

WARNING: Someone broke into my Paxful account,"I just got an [email](https://i.imgur.com/7moeKbz.jpg) 2 hours ago that there was a successful login into my account at PaxFul and it wasn't me.

I'm 100% confident the password wasn't taken from me or intercepted. I haven't used the website since 2016. Someone must have broken into their database then started cracking the hashed passwords. Mine was an easy one - just 9 digits, which may explain why I might be among the first passwords he cracked.

I'm posting this as a heads up to your community. If you have a weak password go change it now. If you don't, I guess you are okay.

There is also a chance that this guy stole it from a different website I'm using and tried it across all bitcoin wallets websites.  I use the same password when I'm not too worried about people breaking in into that account. So Paxful might be innocent and their database still untouched.

But I saw no harm in warning the community.",1532670506,27/07/2018 05:48:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/929x07/warning_someone_broke_into_my_paxful_account/,1

You know what I think...,"I'm sure all you guys have had this happen. ""Oh man, Bitcoin is at 12,000...I can't afford that""!!. There are still so many who don't understand that Bitcoin is divisible. But, there were a lot more of these people when the crypto hype first took off last December. Thus, loads of people bought 1 entire Bitcoin thinking they had too and it caused that insane price inflation. When Bitcoin got to around 16k, most people could no longer afford it (in their eyes) and went after altcoins. They bought entire coins thinking it would turn into 20k like Bitcoin. Anyhow, that caused price inflation in altcoins and Bitcoin went up since the only way to get altcoins was usually coinbase and then converting btc into whatever. As things started to pop, people sold on the same basis. Oh no, my 1 Bitcoin is loosing value....lemme just f**king sell all of it...instead of just a small portion. And that my friends, is how everything popped. Now, I'm no billionaire or cnn ""expert"" but...that's just my 2 cents.

Case study of daily gains by following just one thing. (Example Vechain Binance news),"A very happy Hello to Crypto Community!

I'm writing this to share my experience on how I made a quick gain of 21% in less than 2 hours. I know 21% is a small gain in the crypto world where people talk about 2x-10x but, small gains of 20-50% everyday make an average gain of 600% a month. And that's as good as investing in an ICO and waiting for months to get good returns. Moreover,

What did I do?
At the end of the post I have shared the utility tool that I use to achieve this daily.

So all of us know that taking action is the first step to making money. I read cryptocurrency news all day and try to leverage on one of the news at least. (HOLO listing was one of the news which made me 60% gain in 4 hours).

Today's Action on NEWs : Binance-VeChain &amp; my SECRET TOOL

So I use this utility news app called CryptoHype.live

Keep a track on my portfolio project news

Discover that 1 news that can give me 20-50% daily gain

There are 800+ projects listed in this utility app and even 1 out of these 800 can give you a news that can mint you money in minutes.

The idea is to execute a trade as soon as you spot the news

So as soon as I feel that a particular news is very positive (example - airdrops, exchange listings, partnerships, Achievements) and the project has a good name in the market.

I know that the news will go viral in few minutes. (Since this app gives me the news the very second it is out, I know I am in top 0.1% to know the news and hence I make an immediate BUY call)

Today's case of VeChain Airdrop News:

I was just listening to some music and at about 4pm IST, I get a notification of VTOH airdrop for VET holders from the utility app


CASE STUDY on How I got 21% GAINS in 2 hours by just following one alert of Binance-VeChain

A very happy Hello to Crypto Community!

Today's case of VeChain Airdrop News:

I was just listening to some music and at about 4pm IST, I get a notification of VTOH airdrop for VET holders from the utility app.

This was a Binance news and thus had to be big.

So without wasting much time I went and made a purchase of 20,000 VET token from binance

My purchase was at 4.05 PM IST when VET was trading at 271 Satoshi.

Now that I had 20,000 VET tokens in my BAG

Now I would wait for the news to reach other people and for the price to increase slowly with time.
I generally do my bit my promoting the news so that I am able to convince myself of genuine efforts that I have put in getting profits

I could not thank myself for buying after 1 hour of the purchase.

I could now see my tokens increasing in Satoshi. After about 1.5 hrs of the purchase I was satisfied enough at 21% gains at 320 or so Satoshi (you can see the high on the chart attached above)

I sold all the bags I bought because I don't really care about the airdrop. The news itself is enough to make me more money than the airdrop

This practice can get you crazy gains if done wisely

I do this on a daily basis and keep my self satisfied because the current market is really volatile and ICOs are not doing great either. It's better to play with calculated risks.

I will be sharing more of my daily gain CASES from now on, this would help you to understand how to take action and what news to really go all in with.

Courtesy : cryptohype.live has given me one of the best tools to leverage. So I'm using every bit of it before a lot of people actually start using this tool and I am no longer one of the first people to get the news.

Get the tool from PlayStore

Nuts in a jar analogy: Could BTC become scarcer than we expect?,"I see a lot of BTC being lost as time goes on. How does a person leave them to a beneficiary without handing over the keys before hand which most people won't do and if they make some provision, necessarily kind of involved, there is a really good chance that the BTC get lost at some point.

But also: We know that nuts shaken in a jar, the big nuts end up on top and the smaller nuts on the bottom. Each shake causes the nuts to migrate. It seems to me that every time BTC are sold they tend to get into the hands of people who are likely to hold them and leave the hands of people who are likely to sell them; this is sort of by definition. Of course, some people will sell when the price increases but in general, in a large population of buyers and sellers, more long-term holders will be buyers.

I think with a commodity that has a finite amount, there is a natural migration to holders which is causing BTC to become scarce (unavailable for purchase) at probably a fairly steady rate. Could it be that 1 percent of all BTC traded (not in existence) end up in the hands of long-term holders? Given current volumes, much more than 21 million coins change hands every year; it's maybe every month 21 the volume is 21 million. So could 12 percent of BTC be becoming unavailable every year? That I think is fairly conservative and even at that level, it is clear how hard it will be to find BTC to buy in a decade.",1532690995,27/07/2018 11:29:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/92bpg6/nuts_in_a_jar_analogy_could_btc_become_scarcer/,1

How do I cashout bank log with $4k? Urgent,"I am a noob. I need guidance. I have a bank log used by the owner to verify coinbase. I am good at phishing. But that's where my knowledge ends. I phished this user's email. I got his password. When I checked his email, I saw his bank transactions and coinbase mails. I tried his email password on coinbase and on his bank account. They both worked. Guy uses same password for his email, coinbase and online banking. His online bank has balance of 4,809.55 USD. I am thinking of moving the money to his coinbase and again moving from there. However, I am confused. Don't want to make mistake.

I need someone with experience to buy this from me. I will sell the email, bank and coinbase login to you on one condition. After buying, you will show me how you cashed out. I don't know how to cash out, that's why I am selling. I will sell to you if you show me how you are doing the cashout.

7863 Awesome Deep Web Links List,"We took it one step further by checking them out so we could categorize them, record the name of the site, give a description of the site, record if it was online or offline or dead, what they sell and we even got screen shots. One of the hardest things about the Deep Web is that it is almost impossible to search for anything as search engines do not work there, so you need resources like this to find what you are looking for. It is estimated that 90% of all internet data and websites are hidden from search engine indexing, this area of the internet is known as the Deep Web. Then there is another smaller sub-set of the Deep Web that consists of darknet markets, and sites about drugs, pornography, weapons, assassins, counterfeit and forgeries and hacking etc. This section is called the Dark Web There is also a large section of it for whistle blowers to come forward and expose people, organizations and governments for wrong doings. The Deep Web is a very colorful and diverse place. One thing is for sure though – you have to have a strong stomach if you want to browse. There are things there that once seen can’t be unseen… So thread carefully! Just remember, you need Tor to access the links in this .onion link list and Tor alone is not as secure as you think. If you fall into the false sense of security and think you are safe from being tracked and monitored, then you are sadly mistaken. This has been proven multiple times recently with the FBI using an American university to hijack the Tor network and catch tons of darknet market users. The FBI also hacked “Play Pen” and then used malware to identify the admin and users of the site so they could arrest them. Regardless of how fucked up sites like “Play Pen” are, it shows that the FEDS can do this to any site on the darkweb. By using a good VPN along with Tor you will add an extra layer of encryption and anonymity making it virtually impossible to trace you. Using a good VPN will mean you are sharing an IP with hundreds, if not thousands of other so even if tor was cracked and the real IP found then it would be the VPN IP and they couldn’t tell who it is. We found a good site that tests and rates VPN’s used for Tor here: https//topvpnsoftware.com If you are currently not on Tor browser you will need, close all your programs accessing the internet, turn your VPN on, open tor and come back here. You can sort by any of the columns via the arrow icon or use the search box to be more precise

Blockchain &amp; The Transhumanist Agenda,"As the world is increasingly shifting towards a new, more advanced version of

digitization, an inherent transformation of the Internet and data transfer as a

whole, is essential to support what is, undoubtedly, the biggest and most

disruptive technological advancement in human existence. In recent years there

has been a huge focus on data gathering worldwide, with the assistance of

mainstream media, we’ve all been made aware of how the illicit accumulation of

our personal data is shaping our digital identities in ways that that are out of our

control and in the hands of corporations who have been using our data for their

own gains, while the benefit to ourselves has largely been limited. The constant

drumming of these topics have embedded us with a collective opinion on such

matters, which for the most part, is fabricated by elitists who are ultimately

priming us for an impending solution from all these problems and paving the

way to implement changes that are not only accepted by the general population,

they are desired. Notice how the question being asked is now “How best do we

manage our person data” having never been asked the question if we want so

much of our data recorded in the first place. “Order out of Chaos” is a tried and

tested strategy which has been used by elitists for hundreds of years to usher in

new methods, ideologies, technologies and just about anything that is to be

overhauled with the support of its contributors required.

Based on the information provided by the worlds leading brains in this field, it is

very clear that the agenda for the elitists moving forward is Transhumanism.

Transhumanism is essentially a movement supported by the world biggest

technology companies and government agencies such as DARPA, to ultimately

transform the human condition, using advanced technologies to enhance our

physical and mental capabilities.

The 10 fundamental aspects of transhumanism which are most focused on for

development are

1- Artificial Intelligence

2- Mind Uploading

3- Molecular Manufacturing

4- Autonomous self-replicating robots

5- Cybernetics

6- Space Colonization

7- Gene Therapy

8- Virtual Reality

9- Cryonics

10- Megascale Engineering

The global implementation of Blockchain technology is most certainly the first

part of this overall agenda, which would lay the technological foundations for all

aspects of the transhumanist agenda. The fact is, without blockchain technology,

these would not be able to function to their optimum capabilities, period. As the

technological infrastructure being laid down, the psychological conditioning is

also running in tandem, this is aimed at best preparing our brains for the

upcoming technologies for which we are being primed to desire.

The main tool used for this is predictive programming. For example, ask anyone

what an alien looks like, Most people would probably say ‘little green men with

big black eyes in flying saucers’ this model is embedded into us as a civilization,

through science fiction predictive programming, which over time, desensitizes

the population to the notion that one day it could exist in some form. As soon as,

globally, the general population was somewhat aware of the possible existence

of their agenda’s, even in the fantasy Hollywood world, an early stage of the

process was complete. I think we can all recollect some form of publication,

whether it be a film, book or cartoon which includes one, or more, of the

transhumanist agenda’s main focuses. This is not an accident.",1532739136,28/07/2018 00:52:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/92i2yr/blockchain_the_transhumanist_agenda/,1

"Bitcoin could get yet another price jump as tech giants Apple, Google, and Amazon’s continue to sell off and valuations adjust downward 20% in the coming weeks .","The rolling bear market of the traditional stock markets continues to play-out. Taking out the weakest companies first and advancing on to the stronger companies. We saw Netflix drop, and then Facebook plunge. What’s next? The crowded trades will be the last to correct. Corporate earning are still good, but the smart money knows when to spot a top. P/E rations will simply have to come down, and the market cap of these behemoths will plunge. It’s safe to say that a total crash is highly unlikely due to fundamentals, and strength in the economy, but a 20% pullback in top tech stocks is eminent. 

With the Cryptographic assets having already experience this correction, smart investors selling companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple in the coming weeks will most likely be turning to Bitcoin and a better alternative.

Concerns about exchanges / crypto / blockchain fuckery .. Bit of a rant..,"Probably 95% of us don't know how the internet works but all of us still use it..

I can see that the case is very similar with BTC as well.

1. Exchanges

So once you give your own email address to any of the exchanges, boom are you anonymous now? NOT AT FUCKING ALL.

Everyone is saying that when the next financial crisis comes they wont be able to touch our crypto.. Well if they know your addresses and one of your addys is connected with an exchange they can straight away go to the exchange and ask for it.

Maybe they can't take your money but they could torture the person and they have it.

The governments will probably use AI to match addresses and individuals.

2. Blockchain

I see this word all the time so I will tell you.. A blockchain is A VERY FUCKING SHITTY SLOW database okay.

Most of the projects out there are promoting their 1000-10000tx/s but what WE people don't realize is that is a fully centralised system right there that's the reason for the quick transactions. You have to give up something to get something on the other hand.

So what do we need blockchains for? Ask all the projects they will not be able to give you a decent answer.. 

They either another ""dapp maker"" or ""decentralized 1000tx/s"" or even a company making their own token just for the shill of it, personally I'd avoid 99% of the project if not more. 

However there is a few good projects out there regardless..

You have to believe in your eyes, not your ears, sorry for the rant .. :)",1532768466,28/07/2018 09:01:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/92ksyd/concerns_about_exchanges_crypto_blockchain/,1

Why is the target block time 10 minutes? Why not 20 minutes? Or 5 minutes? Or 1 hour?,"The drama over in bcash land over the proposal to change their tgt blocktime to 1 minute from 10 minutes ( [https://twitter.com/yhaiyang/status/1021699498291027968](https://twitter.com/yhaiyang/status/1021699498291027968) ) has me thinking: what is the optimal block time? 

This is not a new topic in the community, and has been debated over the years, (see e.g., [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232297.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232297.0) )

The main considerations are orphan risk if the blocktime is too short. However, with 10 minute blocktime we are told we should wait 6 confirmations since Satoshi said that this would be irreversible. That means 1 hour. (see [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1170/why-is-6-the-number-of-confirms-that-is-considered-secure?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1170/why-is-6-the-number-of-confirms-that-is-considered-secure?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1) )

So is 10 minutes the truly most optimal blocktime target? Shouldn't we have some proper justification of this parameter, based on some mathematical reasoning so it is not seen as so arbitrary? 

Capping blocksize limit is justifiable to keep BTC scaling out nicely, and you can use examples of blockchain size in future and feasibility of running node in basic setups, etc. 

But using 10 minute blocktime doesnt seem to have the same empirical justification.

AvailCom is a new generation system of the property renting.,"**AvailCom is a new generation system of the property renting.**  
   
 

AvailCom establishes the new standards in the sphere of renting both movable and immovable property. Traditional methods of renting, when the tenant and the landlord must meet in person  
 to sign a contract and give out the keys,  
 are mercilessly passing away. These principles of a partnership simply do not go along with the  
 modern world, where the time and convenience have a top priority.

 The technology of blockchain is increasingly entering the life of ordinary people. More and more platforms today are based on decentralization and shared using. The AvailCom team of developers isn’t an exception. Keeping in mind all the advantages of the blockchain, it was decided to create an ideal and reliable service for renting cars and real estate on this technology.  
   
 

**For the tenants** 

Suppose, you have to visit the USA. The first question arises: where to settle down? The ideal  
 choice is renting a room, an apartment or a house. One of today's popular rental services helps you to find the right option and contact the owner.  
 But then a problem appears. You have to set up the time of meeting with the landlord which is unnecessary loss of time and money because the services charge a high commission - up to 30% of the rent cost).  
   
 

The AvailCom team has set up a goal to eliminate the need for a face-to-face meeting and build up a platform that allows keyless access to  
 rented real estate through just a few clicks. The ideal approach to solve the issue of the rent, isn’t it?!

Under the same scenario, the AvailCom platform will allow you to rent a car and get it in use without keys right away after the payment is done.  
   
 

**For the landlords**  
   
 

Now a few words about the owners of movable and immovable property who plan to make money by giving it to rent. We have developed a number of special devices to be installed in the apartment, house or car. Using those devices you are able automatically search for tenants and hand over them your property through the AvailCom platform.  
   
 

There is no problem with the installation of the devices, because sensors and cameras get attached with no harm for the interior and the automatic lock does not require a change of regular lock. For more details please visit the website of the platform.

Security of the deal will be ensured by customizable smart contracts and decentralized storage of data that will not allow anyone to manipulate ratings and feedbacks.  
   
 

The safety of owner's property will be higher than under a regular deal, since the security system is elaborated to the smallest detail. And by the means of additional sensors and owners notification system, they can stay worry-free about the rented objects.

**For the investors**  
   
 

AvailCom is a team of highly skilled specialists in various fields, whose target is to implement the idea of innovation. Our works-out are not the fiction serials, we set up the real and achievable goals, that can bring success to our investors.

We offer all involved into the project very beneficial conditions, especially large profits are provided at the stage of a closed sale. For additional information go to the official website.  
   
 

We have prepared a number of rules and restrictions that protect the money of participants.  
 Moreover, we conduct a public offering of tokens according to the DAICO concept. That makes the project more solid, so that investors can feel good about it. 

Each participant has the right to vote,  
 which will influence the development strategy of the project as a whole.  
   
 

**In conclusion**  
   
 

The methods of property renting haven’t been changed for centuries, whereas the annual volume of the rental market shows a steady growth. Our platform is going to revolutionize the market of  
 real estate and introduce new rental standards.  
   
 

**At this stage we are working on:**  
   
 

• devices prototypes providing a keyless access to the objects;  
 • risks and restrictions when signing deals through the platform;  
 • creating of documentation base on labor resources management;  
 • documentation on competent financial management;  
 • platform prototypes, users interaction optimization, logic of cooperation.",1532780684,28/07/2018 12:24:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/92lr17/availcom_is_a_new_generation_system_of_the/,1

Soliciting the collective wisdom of the Bitcoin community to answer a question.,"Assumption #1:
When you're past due owing the IRS taxes, you have to pay an annual 12% interest on top of the principle.

Assumption #2:
With almost 10 years data now, we see Bitcoin averaging an annual return of 2244%, but more useful, a ""median"" annual return of 377%. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/79bk25/every_year_since_inception_bitcoin_has_provided/)

Conclusion:
So, if we withhold paying the IRS for one year, we earn about (377% - 12% =) 365% profit in one year.

Setting up a dedicated system for a Full Node + Lightning node. Need Suggestion/Hardware Configuration,"So after many months of consideration, I have finally decided to setup a dedicated machine with a Full Bitcoin node. Have read that 2GB of RAM is enough but would like your suggestions.

* I'm planning to run a full node with segwit support and all the latest developments that go into Bitcoin.
* I'll also be running Bitcoin lightning node.

What kind of setup do you guys recommend:

* I'm planning to have a 1TB of HDD and a 64GB of SSD for linux OS. What do you think about this config?
* Is 4GB of RAM enough?
* Which CPU is recommended? Is Intel Pentium G4400 enough? Can I go lower? My main concern is power consumption. Have read that N3150 can work but I don't see it being sold as a separate chip.
* Which motherboard + CPU combo is recommended if any? AMD CPU is also alright if it is of low power consumption.
* Are there any simple tutorials for a Full Segwit Node and Lightning node. There is too much information out there and it'd be great if someone could recommend the most straight forward setup guide.
* Do you recommend to just use Raspberry pi 3B+ instead of going for a complete computer setup?",1532798564,28/07/2018 17:22:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/92ns3f/setting_up_a_dedicated_system_for_a_full_node/,1

Are the Bitcoin parabolic uptrend days over?,"Looking at the Bitcoin price action recently we could keep asking ourselves are the [days of a Bitcoin parabolic 1250% rise over?](https://trendtradingdna.com/bitcoin-evolution-as-the-market-instrument/) From a trading point of view it is almost impossible to imagine this kind of price action will happen again.
What we could expect now if the Bitcoin breaks above the 9000 an upside swing to 12500 level. This will be clear in the next couple days and weeks and also keep in mind that if we have a break below 7000 again, you could get about the upside continuation and you can turn to 3000 level lower.

Top 5 Blockchain Experts Worth Following (Hand-picked by Our Team),"The blockchain space is super exciting to be in right now. It feels like you’re part of something big, like the Web in 1994. However, these early times of excitement and little oversight attract a lot of snake oil salesmen who have no idea what they are talking about but act as if they know it all. 

The LUDUM team follows the blockchain space closely and has hand-picked a few experts that are trustable and really know what they are talking about.

Bringing Bitcoin to the first Billion users with an E learning testnet wallet,"One of the biggest barriers for Bitcoin mass adoption is complex UX: keys management, fat finger and phishing are not a buzzwords those are  problem that we as a community should solve. 

I was thinking to develop a testnet wallet with an e learning app that let the user practice different tasks and situations in order to
make youngsters and adults understand how to use bitcoin. 

I haven’t worked yet with testnet and have few questions:   

1. Is mycelium testnet wallet or any other testnet wallet are good enough ?
2. On which testnet I should build the wallet? 
3. How many test bitcoin I can get every day and how can I get them ?  Can you share an api or any guide? 
4. What are the current best learning solutions exists today? 

Let me know what do you think on this project, I would like to hear your opinions and suggestions

WARNING: BITMEX LIQUIDATION ENGINE. back to square 1 for me,"I must start by saying this is my personal experience. It comes with a bit of a read but the warning is within the story. I share what I know from testing and past success. Feel free to read backstory or just jump to  BITMEX AND LIQ. ENGINE 

QUICK BACKSTORY(read if you want main story below)

So let me start by telling you that I had the opportunity to buy bitcoin back in 2012 when it was trading around $5 USD a coin. I was going to put a little bit of my  money into it but due to me being in high school(in 2012) and finding the internet rather annoying at that time. When I came upon Bitcoin in 2012  I read into it but due to me not really understanding economics, passed it off as other internet fad and did not pay any more attention to Bitcoin or blockchain at all. Here we stand a few years later but its fine sometimes we miss opportunity.  That said, I started getting more involved this space a bit before the big uptick we all experience in December. Here is where the story really begins. So I began trading some of my money and began to learn  and  understand what I was doing. Essentially doing my homework and putting in the studying hours to understand Technical Analysis, past market conditions, compared to current market conditions. Literally anything I could get my hands on to progress my knowledge in the field of trading.  Equally I was putting money down and not always making the best decisions which by my experience has always been the best way to learn. Either way, I began to understand what I was doing and began trading some more of my money with a success rate I was rather happy with.

 I ended up leaving college because I told myself that this was time better spent. I left my job because I was making more money doing this. I even sold my vehicle because I was sure I could make it back. This is when I found out about Bitmex and equally found out that in the US we are not aloud to use it. Ok fine. I was trading my money and was satisfied with what I was making. Unfortunately sometimes life happens. I experienced a life emergency that required me to get my hands on any funds I could so I sold basically all my holdings to take care of what was immediately at hand.   Life happens.   

BITMEX AND LIQ. ENGINE 

Recently I got the opportunity to leave US and come into a region where BITMEX is aloud.  I got very excited and told myself it was time to try it.    Let me start by telling you that trading on margin is nothing like trading with your own money....whole different ball game that I did not expect. But I embraced it and told myself I was up for the challenge. When I started I first started trading here the returns where almost unreal. If I was not convinced I could do it before. This sold me.   Now ill share that before I had the chance to become profitable here I lost a significant amount of money on MEX close to 1000 US dollars before I really got into a trading strategy that worked for me. A lot of money a lot of man hours.($1000 a lot for a person building in life)

Here is where it really begins and what I feel is actually going on within BITMEX.    Once I became moderately successful in trading on BITMEX, almost immediately did that change.    It all started with an 800% ROE I made. Right after this is where BITMEX literally began to liquidate my account. Ill think ill deem it appropriate to share with you that I am not just some person who wants to make money on the bitcoin trend....no, I began making a living out of this. and when I say I developed a working strategy this essentially means one or 2 trades a day where I wait for nice uptick or the inverse and close in profit. BUY &amp; SELL orders in place. moderate stop loss but equally not taking risky trades or attempting to scalp.  There is a reason people say dumb money and in my opinion, this is not who BITMEX is targeting, people who want to buy at the peaks and sell at rock bottom essentially liquidate themselves. They are not the issue. Nor are the big players or real market makers the targets because at the end of the day BITEMX makes out nicely from maker makes.  Who BITMEX targets are individuals like myself who take time to read charts do appropriate TA and understand overall market conditions before taking any position. People who take time to learn and begin to make a moderate profit.   Moderate profit takers are, at the end of the day,  a problem for BITMEX and must mean that if we are being paid out at too high of a rate, essentially we are biting into their own profits.  After that 800% ROE it was almost as if my trading strategy or myself was targeted because after I that, I have yet to make another successful move, even on this ginormous uptick. Even when my trading strategy began to not be the most efficient, I built on it. Like any good investor would....we must adapt to market conditions.     Here is what I honestly think is happening. In our modern day of AI it is not to far fetched to think that a profitable company such as BITMEX has created an algorithm that essentially acts directly agains profitable individuals. . Having a large holding is one thing but having access to immediate information on trading information, where buy/sell are placed, above or below the market. Information on stop losses and Liq. price are all crucial pieces of information that they have access to. It is not to difficult to write up a neural network that takes all of the above information(BUY/SELL orders, Liq. price, stop losses ) and is told to work within certain perameters to either Liquidate or come fairly close to average liquidation price simply to scare off potential investors. This is what i suspect is happening. It would very much mean nice profits off of individuals closing unfavorable positions in current market conditions.   I am not just suspecting this, I have tested it.   I have put even more of my own money down just to prove myself right and time and time again my suspicions come true.  Today I write to you all as a fair warning that I am almost definite BITMEX works agains individuals like myself and moderate profit takers like me.  I am currently in a very unfavorable life situation because of this liquidation algorithm they have. Currently I have no BTC holding because what I was using to build up essentially was taken by BITMEX. Let me tell you that I am not over leveraging,  Let me tell you I don't put down on a position unless I am comfortable and full in well knowing that there is a chance to lose my money and equally let me tell you that I am not just jumping into positions....my positions are calculated and thought out as are my exit points.  But to experience what I have here really  hurts and I am not an emotional individual but really, within this situation I feel physically sick and a real ache in my heart. This is followed full in well with knowing the current worth of BTC and knowing the overall direction we are going.  I have given up my whole life, have been making money doing this, and was saving to move forward within my situation but to be reduced to not having any holding........... I'm sorry but this takes me back and makes me feel as if my last year has been wasted and have nothing to show for it. 

 I am a good person and do good for those around me, especially my family. I do no harm or foul to anybody in this life and I mind my space and business. I follow the good man above faithfully and recently have even began to question that, simply because of some of the things I am Immediately being dealt in life.  Please use this as a warning and know that if youre trading on a platform such as Binance or another exchange that does not allow margin trading but where you trade with your own money... stick to that. At the end of the day its yours and nobody is attempting to swoop what is yours right from under you or keep it safely on a hardware wallet.      Now, I joke with you not. I have to go back to getting a regular job and have no education behind me....not even transportation to get from point A to point B. Good old fashion walking. I can't even go trade my way out of this one because I have nothing to trade with ha. I came into this space hoping for a bit of financial freedom from my immediate situation. No lambo goals simply wanted to make extra money. When i got to reap some of those benefits it was the best.   Now I sit here with 0.000000000BTC to my name and feel nothing but a feeling of hurt. I even feel a bit upset knowing that it was not even taken from me by a person...that would have been better because this one person would have used it.  It was taken by the damn exchange.    Be careful and know that even if you play it smart in this life....things happen

\*\*For demonstration purposes/ check back soon\*\* Im going to post to you my BTC address here so you can see the 0 balance, those transactions that you see to BMEX are the funds I used to run my testing on this suspected algorithm and its workings. Im  going to tell you that, if you remember me and this story check back to that address next year and we will see how far we have gotten after this mishap.

Help my dad buy crypto please,"I’ve finally convinced him it’s time to invest in digital currency but he wants some one to explain to him how to set up a wallet ad buy coins. This does not just apply to bit coin but he is also interested in other currencies because he thinks he’s missed the bitcoin boat, this brings me on to the second part of this post. Please help me convince him he hasn’t, I’ve told him it currently on the up and has been higher before than it currently is but he tells me that it will flat line soon. I’ve told him that coins are still being added into circulation but will stop at 24 million but he thinks that because it’s digital there is no certainty of this, i then told him its de-centralised and he said this makes even more for the case that more can be added.

Please note that although he probably has above average intelligence when it comes to computers it nothing compared to what is talked about on this sub and our computer set up at home is a very cheep and basic monitor so can any instructions be as simple and basic as possible

"Hi \r\Bitcoin, I need a piece of advice from you about my hodling strategy","I just want to ask for your opinions about my plan of selling/holding some of my BTC.

I had just ignored my bitcoins until last year when it got up to 7k. I may have sold some at 7k (I was enthralled after counting them in $), but it took time to retrieve them from some hidden and hard to access place, so it got close to 19k when I managed to sell, and I sold 20% of them close to the highest value.

My (noob) plan was to sell 20% chunks at 19k, and eventually at 49k, 89k  and hodl 40% forever. The first selling was successful, I put the $ in stocks, but I am not sure about the rest, as I have no clues regarding the BTC dynamics and just want to ask you guys what do you think of my plan? Should I sell more, hold more, set other values? As a reference, if I get to sell 20% more at 49k, I am practically financially set for life.

Bitcoin Recession!,"So many in the crypto space are new too the financial world so there is a sense of arrogance in the air on the newbie traders. The reason why crypto traders are looked at as naive is because traditional guys have a feel of experience being that they've gone through multiple [recessions](https://www.bitcoinwolf.com/how-cryptocurrency-is-changing-the-world/), the most recent being the dot com boom and bust in the 90s and the 2008 housing market crash. Although this may be true I believe being in the crypto space has created adequate traders because of how many times we've gone through extreme bullish and bearish behavior. In the last 9 years we have literally gone through almost as many extreme [recession](https://www.bitcoinwolf.com/how-cryptocurrency-is-changing-the-world/) cases as traditional markets. As a trader in the crypto space that has gone through the ups and downs of the market in the last few years its appropriate to say that the amount of stress gone through dealing with this market will turn the weakest traders into a resilient one if only they stuck around and not have gotten washed out.

Dont let the traditional market old timers give you a reason to feel [inadequate](https://www.bitcoinwolf.com/getting-started/) when they themselves are looking for constant direction in the crypto space.

Where can I buy Bitcoin using a physical debit card in Europe,"How do Bitcoin ATMs work in Europe? It's difficult to purchase BTC in my country, and I was thinking I'd pick my next holiday destination with this in mind. Which EU countries provide the most hassle-free Bitcoin ATM experience? (Ideally Schengen or those that accept a Schengen visa)

Are ATMs restricted to residents of the country in question and would I need to provide any ID? How quick would the delivery to my BTC wallet be? Is there any better/quicker method where I might use a debit card to purchase Bitcoin? Is there any single-transaction / daily limit to the amount of BTC I can purchase?

P.S.: I've tried every cryptocurrency service that offers BTC online via debit card, and none of them work. My government has banned online crypto transactions, so I'm hoping Bitcoin ATMs work more like points-of-sale and don't get blocked by my debit card provider.

Also, I know about localbitcoins; the process is too cumbersome/time-consuming and I'd much rather not reveal my personal information to strangers.",1532895171,29/07/2018 20:12:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/92xn58/where_can_i_buy_bitcoin_using_a_physical_debit/,1

Vertex ICO," Vertex is the place to buy evaluated and established tokens that will have successful ICOs and will get launched on exchanges. This becomes more important as many great tokens never reach the public and are sold out during the private sale. This phenomenon is increasing to the point where ICOs might not go public anymore, and investors will need to find other ways of acquiring these tokens. Vertex will help the average investor to buy into such tokens, long after they have been sold out and under conditions that are better than the ones offered during the ICO itself.

Do you accept Bitcoin?,"PSA:

Dont forget to spread the revolution by asking small merchants if the accept Bitcoin. Not only will it give you the opportunity to possibly pay in cryptocurrency, more importantly it gives you the opportunity to educate others about Bitcoin and distributed ledger technology. 

It takes someone 7 times hearing about bitcoin before deciding to look in to it or ask about it. 

Some Merchants that have a greater tendency toward Bitcoin adoption:

Attorneys (this is a big one),
Nail and Hair Salons (also big),
Independent Restaurants and Coffee shops,
Auto Mechanics,
Used Car Dealers,
Pawn Shops

How does LN work exactly?,"Hello, I have been reading about the technical side of Bitcoin, but I am not an expert by any means, and I have heard a few rumors that I am concerned about. 

To be honest it's mostly spread by the bcash media, so I don't really trust their accuracy, but it's still mentioned often enough for me to be curious about it.

They claim that the LN network is a mandatory uppgrade, which will lock your coins inside it forever, and then it will be at the mercy of the LN node operators, who can then seize it at their will like if it were like a bank account. They have also claimed this about Segwit. Basically they claim that it forks the network into 2 separate coins and then if you don't upgrade then you will lose your coins, but if you do, then you lose control over your coins and hand it over to a middleman. They think that the LN network is like a bank network where the LN node operators are custodians of money.


Now as ridiculous as that sounds, I want to know more about this, and I want people to explain to me exactly how this LN network works. I have good knowledge about computers and programming, so I can understand any explanation. So please refer to me to some kind of whitepaper or documentation that explains how it works exactly and debunks this kinds of myths.

If we can debunk these kinds of myths then we can expose them and their obvious lies.

So please explain to me how the LN network works and what is the relationship between the LN nodes and the coins and the miners exactly. Thank you.",1532935527,30/07/2018 07:25:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9320sf/how_does_ln_work_exactly/,1

What will happen if Singapore regulates bitcoin,"**What will happen if Singapore decides to regulate Bitcoin?**

At a conference, Ravi Menon, the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore’s central bank, stated that the country has no intention to regulate bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in the short-term.

In short, Ravi Menon shares the same sentiment as European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi, who as CCN reported, explained that the ECB has no plan for regulatory frameworks for the cryptocurrency market as of yet. Draghi emphasized that the ECB believes the bitcoin market needs to mature for the institution to consider regulating it.

Menon stated

“We’ve taken the approach that the currency itself does not pose the risk that warrants regulation. It is a known fact that cryptocurrencies are quite often abused for illicit financing purposes, so we do want to have AML/CFT controls in place. So those requirements apply to the activity around cryptocurrency, rather than the cryptocurrency itself.”

**What Happens if Singapore Starts Regulating Bitcoin?**

Although Menon clarified that there will be no strict regulations for the Singapore cryptocurrency market yet, he reaffirmed that the MAS will continue to be “open minded” with cryptocurrencies. More importantly, Menon noted that if the MAS and the Singaporean government sees the need of regulating the bitcoin market, it will provide regulatory frameworks for businesses and investors.

As Menon explained:

“Our approach is to look at the activity around the cryptocurrency and then make an assessment of what regulation would be suitable.”

If Singapore decides regulate its cryptocurrency and bitcoin exchange markets, there exists a highly probability that along with Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea, Singapore will evolve into one of the major bitcoin market. Consequently, Asia is likely emerge as the cryptocurrency powerhouse region, considering that Japan is accountable for over 46 percent of bitcoin trades.

If the MAS decides to regulate its bitcoin market, the Japanese government’s roadmap towards establishing a national program for cryptocurrency exchanges will very likely be implemented. Cryptocurrency exchanges will then receive licenses to operate as regulated financial service providers and will be treated fairly as legitimate financial companies within the country.

In the future, if the Singaporean government regulates its bitcoin market, there exists a high probability that traders from regions like China and Russia will migrate to the Singaporean market to trade and use bitcoin. Additionally, leading bitcoin companies such as India’s second largest bitcoin exchange Zebpay are already based in Singapore, due to the country’s friendly regulations for startups.

"Tired to buy something with Bitcoin. Its a pain in the ass, a nightmare","Since I had left some BTC dust laying around I thought I pay with BTC instead of credit card. The website told me to deposit a certain amount. I bought the bitcoin with fiat from an exchange and deposited it. Despite high fees, it took fucking 45 minutes to arrive. Finally when it arrived, the price of BTC has changed so much that the website said I need 0.00002 BTC more to pay for the product. because the price flactuded slightly. 
so now i wanted to buy 0.00002 from the exchange - you fucking cant, there is minimum order. so i have to buy more and again build up dust. then wait another 45min for it to arrive, hopefully the price havent changed so much again buy then.

[Venezuela] The Bitcoin Standard as a reference for Exchange. Real adoption.,"Due to hyperinflation and the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, Cryptocurrency specially Bitcoin has been a way out to leave the country economically without having to leave physically. 

We don't have official data of exchange by the government since they try to hide the Inflation and put make up on the numbers. Who do we trust to tell us how much is a USD worth in our useless Fiat currency? 

For a couple of years now we used to have websites like dolartoday, telling us daily ""This is the price"", they used to claim that the price depended on the market, yet they are a centralized entity there was no indicators that proved so. Today we see a new Value including in these websites. 

""Bitcoin Dollar"" Is a reference now, while its value can be different than CASH usd in the market, it's an allusion to the Bitcoin Standard, the value of Exchange USD/Bolivares changes with Bitcoin drops and rises, as any market, when Bitcoin is rising people want to get rid of their Bolivares therefore they buy Bitcoin, people sell at high prices increasing the value of the USD and Bitcoin in Bolivares.

The point is:  Bitcoin is a reference of the value of our currency, as devaluated as it is, it is the only reliable source we can trust, that's how adoption begins, this is why Venezuela is so relevant to Cryptocurrencies, you can see them take action here day by day. 

Any question AMA.

"Daily Market Recap - 07/30 - BTC Moving Sideways, Will It Go Down Before It Gets Better?","*Processing img sv9oy9cjx2d11...*

The crypto markets are still stagnant from the weekend malaise and waiting from the pin to drop. The Asian Markets wasn't able to push the prices nor the volumes this Monday morning and there was almost no movement. The market capitalization is now at $293.8 Billion, an inch lower from yesterday’s $296 Billion at the same time yesterday. The trading volume for the past 24 hours has risen higher from yesterday’s $12.5 Billion to $13.8 Billion at the time of this writing.  

Bitcoin is signaling to go lower at the current price of $8154. There was almost no change in price since Saturday as it consolidates. Volume is still at $4 Billion with negative growth at -0.16%. It is important to note that over the weekends it struggled to keep the price above $8k and in the nearest term, it should break above $8300 in order to move forward and avoid pulling back to below 8k.

mining with core?,"Hi,

I was absent from the client news for some time, so I have a question. I found out that the general core client is not able to mine any more (or is the option only removed in the gui?). However, I think it is against the idea of decentralization to have the option removed, because if for some reason the mining industry fails, the user can not switch on mining any more. Do I need to use a different Wallet Client, an older version or do I need to switch the chain if I want to support decentralization?",1532965079,30/07/2018 15:37:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9353n7/mining_with_core/,1

Open source project that will change the way people use bitcoin.,"Have you ever had these kind of night when you can't sleep and your brain is hyper active ?

Well, a month ago that's what happened to me.

I'm part of the bitcoin community and I truly believe that bitcoin will have a big place our future.

That night I couldn't stop thinking about the major problem of bitcoin.

It's a deflationist currency, well it's not really a problem itself but, it makes people hodl instead of spend. 

Why buy a croissant with a bitcoin today if you can buy 10 tomorrow ?

That's a major problem cause bitcoin was a revolutionary solution that would change the way economy works forever, and now just became a speculative product... Check twitter, people constantly talk about t's price instead of mass adoption.

Usually when you have an amazing idea, the next day you think about it and you found so many flaws, and the idea loses all interest. But my idea grew and grew, and I made it better and better.

I think that night i've found a solution to make people spend their coins instead of holding them, and this, without even make them potentially lose money in case of price increasement.

How ? Well I cannot talk about it in public yet of course, my project is at it's very early stage.

That's why I need you, the talented guy that studied maths and/or algorithm.

And that's why I need you, the guys that are very excited to read this article and who want to maybe write history with their names,

I'll need developers, blockchain experts, AI experts and anyone who wants to contribute.

This is an open source project so it's based on volonteers. 

But it's doesn't mean that it can't be a profitable project, many open source projects are actually very profitable.

I would like to debate about my idea with you, share it a maximum, I want to reach as many people as possible. 

GUYS LET'S CHANGE THE WORLD.

Localbitcoins Biased Support - Mishandling my case,"Here are series of events and I need opinions from experts here

1. I open trade for $41500

2. Seller sends bank details

3. I couldn't pay as bank was closed so I cancel

4. Next day I reopen trade and confirm bank details again

5. Seller confirms and I pay

6. Seller texts me on phone to cancel and he will send btw directly to wallet.

7. I refuse and argue

8. He gets pissed and disputes

9. Admin asked for ID next to trade screen I provide

10. Admin asks me to provide ID next to payment screen. I explain that I paid in person at branch and provide receipt and lbc screen in a photo

11. Lbc asks seller to provide account statement and he refused claiming he never sent details

12. Lbc paste his messages and ask again. He says it was copy paste error although the second trade was 12 hours later.

13. Admin once again asks me to provide online banking screen and id together. I once again explained the situation about in person payment and I sent receipt held next to phone screen, ID held to phone screen, bank statement showing transaction stamped and signed by bank, bank letter in reply to my complain about transfer where bank states they can't give me refund as funds have already been credited to beneficiary. I sent 24 pages of evidences and explanations.

14. After waiting whole weekend , lbc once again asks me to send id with Internet banking screen and same explanation they asked before I uploaded 24 pages. They simply asked same question without reading my attachments. Plus they gave 12 hours deadline or it will be resolved against me with other party haven't provided a single evidence

If you realise seller provided nothing yet. Just 2 messages in last 7 days. Is this fair? Why they don't read attachments that we provide? What next I should do?

DACC: Decentralized Accessible Content Chain,"DACC is the world’s first content-based blockchain that features Identity and Access Management (IAM) at the infrastructure level.The distributed ledger and decentralized file system of DACC provides all the benefits expected from modern day blockchain-based technologies, but also goes a step further via the creation of its unique IAM feature; focusing on security of content and intellectual property.
Its merits include the well developed business plan, the business model set to effectively stimulate token circulation, and the technology behind the network raises the bar in terms of security.

Furthermore, the company is able to depend upon partnerships that have already been established with a wide range of Advisors and Strategic Participants.

Some not so negative thoughts on the bitfi wallet,"Hi, just wanted to share my thoughts on the new bitfi wallet.

If we could forget about McAfee for a moment as there is a lot of mixed opinions about him and his marketing strategy.
I think the $100,000 reward is just a way to try and get people to understand this wallet doesn't actually store anything on it and it does not work in the same way a trezor, ledger or kepkey work.

I currently use a ledger but it's not all plane sailing.
I can't use certain coins with my phone, I get crashes on the device when using myetherwallet, I don't always have access to a computer and I worry about someone finding the recovery phrase or wallet and stealing my coins.

All the bitfi hardware seems to do is give you a safe place to input your salt and password when you want to confirm a transaction. This device does not store your actual keys under a 6-9 digit code like the competition.
It looks to be a new user friendly take on how a brain wallet could work.

What I like about this system...
-you could technically buy one device and multiple people could share it to access there own accounts without effecting anyone elses wallets.
-You do not need to have a certain computer or phone running a specific app/os to manage your crypto.
-No cables and dongles
-you would not have any worries about keeping the device/recovery safe.

The thing I would like to see is someone hacking the WiFi network that the device is connected to or to see if there's anyway to push a update to the device which could install something to record what is being inputted on the screen. This is the only areas I could see for a potential attack.

There are some arguments that people are not very good at creating there own unique passphrase which I guess is true for some people.
The company does seem to give pretty good instructions on how to make a good passphrase it also has to be over 30 characters long and has to have a salt. 

I think it's good to have some competition in this space that is a completely different take on how a ""wallet"" could work and it would be good to see some proper technical reviews and tests being done on the wallet from people who have the bitfi.

How to use bitnovo,"Hello
I have 4 voucher of €25 each to redeem at bitnovo... i was wondering, I've read many things about them and some people apparently got scammed and got about 50% of the value in Bitcoin without any info before redeeming? How is that possible?
I'd like to ask what is the best currency i can redeem for €100 (to transfer to kraken wallet) to avoid paying 50% in fees... If I simulate the buying process i see that actual conversion shows €5-€3 depending on the currency... is that real or will it show (and send) a very different amount in the end after confirmation?",1532986465,30/07/2018 21:34:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/938a8s/how_to_use_bitnovo/,1

3 Bitcoin Lost die to BIP-38 and inexperience with crypto,"Hey guys, I’m pretty sure I’m out of luck but any help would be appreciated. I bought 3 Bitcoin a couple years ago. Last year I decided to store them on a paper wallet to be safer. Today I went to move them to my ledger and was asked for a password. Apparently I clicked on the BIP-38 option and entered a passphrase when they created the wallet.  At the time I only had Bitcoin and a few ethereum all stored on Coinbase. I remember moving the Bitcoin to the paper wallet and being extremely nervous because I hadn’t moved any cryptos from Coinbase yet. Since then I’ve branched out to different alt coins and have used many wallets with many passwords. The most frustrating part of this whole thing is that I am so careful to write down passwords/phrases, laminate them, make copies, and put them in a fireproof safe.  
    I just reached out to walletrecoveryservices but don’t have much hope because I can’t even recall making a password.  Everything I’m reading makes it sound like I’m going to be out of luck especially if I made a multiple word pass phrase instead of a standard password....
   Anyone have any other ideas here?...

It’s just money, but it sure stings on day one :(

Cons of Bitcoin Cash?,"So what are the real differences between bitcoin and bitcoin cash, and, in particular, what are the cons of bitcoin cash? 

I posted in a different forum earlier about the difference, but in fears of that particular subreddit being biased I wanted to get the opinion from this one too (a commenter recommended it and said this forum might be more honest.)

Thanks in advance for your input guys

Just realized I lost 3 Bitcoin b/c of my inexperience with paper wallets last year,"Bought some Bitcoin a few years ago. Last July I decided to finally move them to a safer option than Coinbase. I created some paper wallets and sent them over. I remember being extremely nervous b/c that was the first time I sent anything out of Coinbase. Everything seemed successful and I’ve checked my balance using my address every few months since then. I finally decided to move them onto my Ledger and claim my forks. Apparently I clicked the BIP-38 box and created a password. I have no recollection of this and no record of any password or passphrase. The frustrating part is that I have created many wallets since for other coins and take every precaution with backups/laminating copies and putting them in a fireproof safe. All I remember is reading that as long as you had your private key you are good to go with the paper wallet.  I can’t find a copy of a password anywhere. 
    I’ve reached out to WalletRecoveryServices.com and hope they can help, but I’m feeling pretty hopeless here. Anyone have any other ideas or success stories?  
   On the bright side, I have a job, a home, and an amazing wife. I’d also like to think that the fact that one can lose these coins so easily because of a simple mistake, we have a ways to go before it goes mainstream. 
   It definitely stings quite a bit today tho. If anyone has any ideas let me know. Thanks ",1533012556,31/07/2018 04:49:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93bh3d/just_realized_i_lost_3_bitcoin_bc_of_my/,1

Bitcoin’s Biggest Startups Are Backing a New Effort to Keep Fees Low,"# According to the recent bitcoin news, it is now clear that the bitcoin’s biggest startups are backing a new effort to keep fees low. Lest start from the idea of low fees. In every bitcoin transaction there fees associated with transactions and even request for bitcoin wallet creation. With that idea in mind, [bitcoin latest news today](https://www.cointiko.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoins-biggest-startups-are-backing-a-new-effort-to-keep-fees-low/) it is now clear that there has been more and more efforts from crypto firms pushing for low fees as far as crypto transaction fees is concerned. It is now a point where we need to ask ourselves why the economic communities have been pushing for keeping the fees as low as possible.

For those who dont know what is bitcoin for:,"It’s borderless. You could go to any country and use it.

It is safer to carry bitcoins than to carry cash, especially if you bring a large amount of money or if you’re travelling to a country with higher crime rates. Bitcoin is easy to exchange to major local currencies, if you plan to travel to multiple countries and wish to avoid the hassle of exchanging money. The Bitcoin Traveler does just this

If the establishment doesn’t accept bitcoin payments, sell your bitcoins (through LocalBitcoins) or withdraw your money from ATMs with the help of payment cards.


It’s not subject to the whims of a government. The supply is constant and the price is determined by free market demand.


Secure store of value.

This use case is crucial in environments where citizens cannot trust that institutions will be responsible stewards of their hard-earned money. Consider the tragic case of a country like Venezuela, where individuals’ property and savings can be confiscated by authorities through law or inflation. Many Venezuelans are unfortunately unable to access traditional forms of exit such as emigration or stealthily accruing more stable sovereign currencies. With cryptocurrency, more Venezuelans have an alternative: They can opt to purchase or mine a secure store of value that cannot be confiscated or inflated away by their government because they alone control their private keys. (Indeed, cryptocurrencies are especially popular in Venezuela for precisely this reason.)

Smart contracts.

For example, let’s say that Alice would like to gift her granddaughter, Erin, with a sum of money upon her 18th birthday. Today, Alice’s option is basically to hire a lawyer to create a trust that will hold the funds and disburse them on the appointed date. Being a technologically-savvy grandmother, however, Alice knows that she can simply program a smart contract to do the same thing without having to employ an intermediary. Alice creates a cryptocurrency wallet for herself and another for her granddaughter Erin. Alice sends the equivalent of $10,000 to her wallet and programs a smart contract. The contract is set up so that on the day of Erin’s birthday—let’s say January 3, 2027—the contract will automatically move the funds from Alice’s wallet directly to Erin’s, where she will have complete control of those funds. Once Alice sets the transaction in motion, she no longer has access to the funds, just as if she had created a trust. (it works also for inheritances)

It’s banking the unbanked. You can bypass the traditional banking system, avoid surveillance, and get rid of hefty fees.

Cryptocurrencies remove the need to rely on this trusted third party to make a transaction. In effect, a cryptocurrency replaces a third party like Bank of America or PayPal with the network itself, which is managed by a distributed web of computers all across the world. This means that Alice can make a payment online directly to Bob whenever and wherever she wants, without needing to introduce another party which may be cumbersome or expensive. This also means that people without access to banking services can now take part in digital commerce.

Programmers, developers, online teachers, designers and anyone who can do online work can benefit from this bitcoin advantage, especially in poorer countries where most people can not access international bank accounts.

Bitcoin has no risk of credit card fraud or credit card chargebacks,

Compared to traditional payment methods, bitcoin is an attractive prospect for business owners, Bitcoin has no risk of credit card fraud or credit card chargebacks,This is a huge problem for the travel industry because the payments are often large.

For example, many European or American online stores block or avoid receiving credit card payments from Africa because of the fraud risks, with bitcoin, online stores could accept purchases from customers from Africa without chargeback risks, both parties win, the Buyers can access the merchandise and sellers can sell without risk.

What are the main Trends/Challenges for Bitcoin and whole industry?,"Nowadays Bitcoin is getting more popular, almost everyday appear new startups with attractive Whitepapers, which raise implausible money via ICOs and going to solve all possible and impossible problems. Because of this noise it is complicated to concentrate on real problems and current challenges for Crypto World and community.     


So here is what I mean:  


\- \~ 600 BC Metal Coins appeared.  


\-&gt; 2009 Bitcoin p2p Electronic Cash System, which operates without any central authority, was launched and allowed to make transactions without banks and removed government monopoly on minting, distribution and control of money.  


\-&gt; 2010 Mt Gox appeared, allowed to buy and sell Bitcoin.  


\-&gt; 2012/2013 Peercoin/NXT appeared trying to replace PoW with PoS.   


\-&gt; many altcoins appeared, 2013 Mastercoin launched, which allowed to create coins on top of Bitcoin layer.    


\-&gt;  this idea was elaborated and in 2015 Ethereum was launched, that widely introduced smart contracts, ability to create own tokens and develop dapps on top of Ethereum blockchain. ICOs became trendy.  


\-&gt; 2017 Lightening Network launched that enabled fast transactions for Bitcoin and micropayments.   


Of course I mentioned not everything, a lot of things seems to be done, but more to come.   


What's next for crypto industry? What are the most important Challenges now, what problems/weaknesses should be solved? Who is trying to solve them now and how?

How does Bitcoin inadvertently urge governments to became more decentralized?,"Ironically, so many governments around the world, which now staunchly oppose Bitcoin, might gain more power for themselves from its adaption. Here's an example of the Monaco Principality.

Many decades ago (14 April 1945 to be precise) Monaco managed to fall under the auspices of the Franco-Monegasque agreement on foreign exchange controls effectively delegating all of its regulatory authorities to the all-powerful European host. As a result, today, when Bitcoin is irritatingly bouncing back and forth on the local gatekeepers' radars, they can do only so much about that as to voice their frustrations and to warn the general public on its ""dangers"".

For example in its communique (June 2016) [Commission de Contrôle des Activités Financières](http://www.ccaf.mc/)soberly announced that [... *(Bitcoins) ...  do not qualify as currencies and are not subject to a specific regulation. (Bitcoins) are not legal tender and are not a means of exchange which value is guaranteed by a Central Bank.* ...](http://www.monacoforfinance.mc/en/legal-environment/cross-border-operations.html)

Another ""friendly"" to Bitcoin and its peers organization, the local version of FINCEN - the [Service d’Information et de Contrôle sur les Circuits Financiers](https://www.siccfin.mc/en) (SICCFIN) through its high-positioned representatives staunchly proclaimed the following: [... *the missions of SICCFIN (the Financial Network Information and Control Department) ... (is to prevent) ... the dangers of virtual currencies such as bitcoins ...*](http://www.monacoforfinance.mc/en/articles/other-topics/771-marie-pascale-boisson,-%E2%80%9Cin-some-major-financial-groups-combating-money-laundering-has-become-the-corporate-culture-%E2%80%9D.html)

With such a ""sunny"" disposition towards the most important innovation introduced to the world's financial industry during the past century there's a little doubts that, given a possibility, the local watch-dogs would happily dispose of it in as brief time frame as possible. However, bound by a 70-years-old treaty, all they can do now is to wait for the decision arriving from Paris. Hopefully, that provides local doorkeepers some food for thoughts about the potential benefits of the global decentralization movement, which Bitcoin is proud to represent.

"I have been a customer of BTC-e / WEX.nz for five years. Today, they scammed me out of $11,000 worth of crypto and closed my account. WEX.nz; the next exchange to collapse.","I have been a customer of BTC-e.com, nowadays known under the ""WEX.nz"" brand, for over five years. During the past five years, the exchange has dealt with trouble every now and then, but usually recovered. Today, I stupidly decided to try trading on WEX.nz again, a mistake which ended up costing me $11,000 worth of cryptocurrencies and the closure of my account within less then an hour.

Earlier today, I deposited almost $11,000 worth of Litecoins to the WEX.nz exchange. The deposit was confirmed within mere minutes, but even before the deposit was credited to my WEX.nz account, I found out something was wrong. While waiting for my deposit to clear, I revisited the infamous ""trollbox"". To my surprise, I found people complaining about how withdrawals have been disabled for weeks and how WEX.nz is in trouble. Panic attack ensued; I, unknowingly, had just deposited $11,000 worth of cryptocurrencies to an exchange that has legal and financial troubles. 

There were no warnings on the WEX.nz exchange. No news items, no pop-ups, no warnings that withdrawals are disabled.

A crypto transaction can not be stopped, so the first thing I did was contacting WEX.nz's support. I asked them to immediately deposit the crypto I deposited to a provided address. 

WEX.nz refused; according to them, transactions (including deposits that were made 5 minutes ago despite the fact that withdrawals are disabled) and refunds are irreversible. One of the customer service agents (Sara) even said that ""the funds are no longer available"" - Freudian slip, maybe? 

In any case, I kept pressuring, and they eventually locked/suspended my account.

WEX.nz is currently requesting my passport and other legal information. That is the only way they will reinstate my five-year old account. All of this happened within less then an hour.

If any WEX employee or owner(s) are reading this, I would like you to answer the following questions:

1) Why are withdrawals disabled?
2) Why are withdrawals enabled for a select few coins (PPC, NMC, and ZEC)?
3) Why don't you inform/warn new/returning customers of the fact that withdrawals are disabled?
4) Why are you still taking deposits?
5) Why can't you return a deposit I made an hour ago? You just got those coins, so what's stopping you from returning them?
6) When can we expect withdrawals to be enabled again? Or can we expect withdrawals to be enabled again within the next 5 days? 

I honestly don't believe withdrawals will be enabled again. An exchange accepting deposits and disabling withdrawals has always been a sure sign of the exchange being in deep financial and/or legal troubles. I made a stupid decision, but I want to prevent others from making the same mistake. I am 100% confident I am out $11k, but lets try not to give these scammers and thieves any more coins in the meantime.

BTE-e.com and thus wex.nz user since late 2011. My partners and I revived a Singapore court ordered over $2.8MM judgment. WEX.NZ is dead. Do not send them money. (this was posted here as I can't post in /r/litecoin but is just as valid for bitcoin),"They will end up in jail. This is a new reddit account as I have already had death threats on myself and family. Lee can contact me directly to check out my story as he personally knows me.

The reason for my posting now is that the courts and the law are now in the end stages here in Singapore yet these people keep stealing. I'm just going to add to the message going around that people should not send them money. Also if you can, take what you can out.

Our money was stolen back when they took the funds from BTC-e.com and did not get them to us in WEX.NZ. They knew about the “error”.

If any of you have a significant claim and want to involve lawyers and the law I can help direct you.

I would like to point out to those of you who would like to say that crypto is beyond the law and that I am fail for using law, I'd like to say that WEX.NZ told me they had the legal right to take the crypto thus starting this. They had more than several opportunities to make things correct. They knew what would come and they know who I am in the community. They knew this would be the end result.

Also $2.8MM is not a significant amount to us and we have put aside an equal amount for the recovery of the funds. So please do not attack us for risking more money that we could lost. We know how the game is played and we are playing it long term. BTC-e.com was the first “legit” site to support LTC and after GOX fell it was the only “legit” site out there. It is all to easy to trust the once longest standing site out there when we are all too busy driving about in our Lambos and hanging out in our alpaca socks. We have been scammed before and I'm sure we will be scammed again. Only thing left is to try to prevent it from happening again.

We know who we are after and it is only a matter of time. If you are involved and reading this I want you to know we have the time, and we are set to seek you out even after our death, natural or not. This will never end for you. You should turn over what information you have to the law when they contact you (or better yet, contact them or my lawyer first) and seek good terms. Sadly since your boss has forced this out of my hand, I can no longer be helpful, I can no longer walk away from this. Before we just wanted our funds back, but now the State wants punishment for illegal acts. Your bosses are selling you out. Some of you are citizens of Singapore and will have some real issue to deal with very soon. We, and thus the State knows who you are. You know what will happen to you if you resist so please do not. I understand you are just pawns in the game so do not sacrifice years of your life for their greed.

If anyone needs help going after the criminals or has information to share please let me know. I'm not after the money, just want to do the correct thing for the community.

I have not posted in the LTC community for ages. Can anyone tell me what ever happened to Greedi? That guy was something else... Also Friedcat, did someone get to him?? I'm worried as I have not heard from him in years and years.

TL;DR If you do not hold your coins they are not yours and WEX.NZ is not a company that is worth risking doing business with.

p.s. It is very late here in Singapore so I might not be around for a bit. I just posted as I saw the other scam post and wanted to make sure it is odds are legit.",1533069434,31/07/2018 20:37:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93i6o1/bteecom_and_thus_wexnz_user_since_late_2011_my/,1

Request help with blockchain search,"I have a specific output I'm searching for. Known:

* approximate value of output to within .001 btc (e.g.  2.155 &lt; x &lt; 2.156)
* date range (e.g. 3/1/18-3/14/18)

These are not the actual values, but demonstrate closely what I'm going for. Not as easy as it looks, since the exchange addresses I'm interested in send thousands of outputs per day. Blockchair.com has the most advanced search features, but as far as I can tell not quite what I need.

If I could export the entire transaction history of a given address to csv, then it would be much easier to search.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

How does Bitcoin work for average Joe?,"I know what Bitcoin is and how it works (on a high level). I have some on my Trezor and some on Coinbase. But anyway, I was thinking..

In what way is Bitcoin appealing for average Joe when the value fluctuates often hour by hour? Change $1000 USD to Bitcoin and see your $1000 become $900 or $800 in hours. Or $1500 a week later.

Transaction fees. During the craziness in the end of 2017 it did cost $15 just to transfer Bitcoin. If I want to buy a burger in town for $5 and it cost me $15 to pay that $5 value in Bitcoin. It does not make sense. 

Sometimes the transfer is slow. How can I be sure I will get my Bitcoins when you buy from my store? Credit card transaction is less than a minute, .. 

I can see the value in speculation. Buy Bitcoin, wait and sell them at higher price later. Like a high risk saving account. 

Don’t get me wrong. I like the idea with crypto. But I see some big issues for average Joe. 

Any thoughts?

New website for estimating and setting a custom transaction fee for beginners,"Different wallets have different UI and measures for setting the custom fee and I've always found it hard to figure out what fee has to be set in each wallet if I want to get a confirmed transaction in an hour.

Here the USD fee is clearly shown for a confirmation in 10, 30 and 60 minutes and then the sat/BTC/mBTC fee per byte/kbyte is also shown to match as much fee variations as possible to make it easier for the new Bitcoin users to dive into the fee world.

Suggestions and comments are highly appreciated. :)

LN fun!,"Just for fun, I changed the parameters in my LND, setting minimum htlc size (i.e. payment size) to 1 millisatoshi. I then created a channel directly to a clightning node, which can create millisatoshi invoices (LND can not. Might have to fix that).  


I then had the admin of that clightning node (this was a coordinated test) give me 997 invoices of 1 millisatoshi, and paid them as fast as my node could process them with a simple script calling the command-line client as fast as I could. It took 13 minutes, or less than a second per invoice. With a script that kept the connection open, it'd be even less. All of them paid, successfully.

  
Of course, if you need to settle, this will be rounded down to the nearest satoshi. But we can totally divide the bitcoin into more than 100 million now!",1533071361,31/07/2018 21:09:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93igwl/ln_fun/,1

itt I explain what bitcoin is,"It's a type of Torrent technology, which ensures that a copied file is the same.
The problem is, people don't understand why money has value. If you asked a random person on the street, he couldn't explain why a $100 bill is valuable. Even many economists would struggle.

So, bitcoin is an attempt to use torrent-like technology to create a New Money. 
But as we mentioned, it is done by people who don't understand money. And bitcoin will thus fail.",1533076000,31/07/2018 22:26:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93j4g6/itt_i_explain_what_bitcoin_is/,1

Something to think about 🤔,"American economy is 1/2 of the entire World economy

America spends over half of its economy on war, military, death, destruction. 

Over 1/4 of the World economy currently requires the maintaining of death/destruction so that we don’t collapse this economic ecosystem

Imagine if bitcoin = world economy 
World economy could possibly = technological advancements for the in-betterment of mankind! ",1533076145,31/07/2018 22:29:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93j576/something_to_think_about/,1

Interest in death vault service for keys,"One of the biggest challenges with crypto is that you lose the keys, you lose the funds.  There isn't a reasonable way to recover.  So, my question: if there was a service that would store your encrypted keys offline and provide them to your next of kin with proof of death - would you be interested?

If interested, what would you be willing to pay?  One time fee?  Subscription?

What would you need to see in the service before you would sign up?  What would make you comfortable that the security side is done right?

I have some ideas about how to do this the right way, but would like to gauge if it would be a sustainable service to put together.",1533079209,31/07/2018 23:20:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/93jjxp/interest_in_death_vault_service_for_keys/,1

Tracking Down Scammers,"This is not 100% about Bitcoin, but I figured, given the make up of the Bitcoin community, that someone in this sub might be able to help.

I got a threatening email, ""blah blah blah, I got video of you through a hacked webcam of you jerking it.  Ima send it to all your contacts and facebook friends if you don't pay me X amount""

Pretty typical probably.

So I have an outlook email address, a source server ip with general geographical location, a bitcoin wallet number and any other info that may be embedded in an outlook email.

Is there anything I can do to screw with this person?

Is there somewhere I should be reporting this that may care or may have the tools to run it down?

Thanks
