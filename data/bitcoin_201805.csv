Merchant Bitcoin adoption at local fairs,I was planning on renting a tent out at local fairs and festivals this summer with a focus on bitcoin merchant adoption. My goal would be to have one new tent accept bitcoin at the end of the day. I was wondering if you guys had any advice or guidance? I have been in the bitcoin space ~1 year so far and have a basic understanding of bitcoin. Also if you guys knew of any suggestions for nic nac bitcoin items to sell that would be cool to get people inside the tent to start the conversation.,1525134913,01/05/2018 00:35:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g4dsb/merchant_bitcoin_adoption_at_local_fairs/,1
Question about gift tax,"I have a question when Bitcoin is received as a gift. If someone receives bitcoin as a gift in the U.S.A, can cash out ""immediately"" without any gain, what kind of tax should the recipient be paying?

1\) Short term gain \(less than one year\) or Long term gain \(more than a year\)?. Again, if you receive bitcoin as a gift and

you cash out right away, should the recipient be paying for this??

2\) What cost basis should the recipient use? and what kind of documentation he/she needs to submit to IRS??

Again, you receive them as gift, and it is not easy for you to ask all the documentation from the sender. I mean what if the sender does not want to share all the information??

Have any of you tried explaining the logic of bitcoin investing to friends and family members?,"Have any of you tried explaining the logic of bitcoin investing to friends and family members?

A lot of my friends think I'm one of those""CRAZY friends investing in that crypto scam...""

I took a little time to write out my logic below and I don't know why anyone wouldn't invest in crypto after hearing this.

Also, I'm Interested to hear your opinion and what your friends and family think about crypto :)

REASON 1:

The fact a lot of people think crypto is crazy is actually a good sign. We're early adaptors!

No one who was a part of something life changing was in the majority in the beginning. FACT: Most people who are forward thinking are thought of as crazy.

Example: I think the world is round... you're crazy!

So, it's not a bad thing to be thought of as crazy (well in some cases it may be...). But it's a fact that crazy people are the ones changing the world (for good and bad...).

REASON 2:

Crypto is here to stay.

It may be unstable now, but if you do your due diligence (i.e. read this: https://ci.covesting.io/article/nasdaq-open-one-day-becoming-cryptocurrency-exchan ) you'll realize that institutional money IS and WILL continue to be getting involved.

Think twice before believing major media...

Media is owned by big money and big money wants to get as much crypto for the cheapest price they can before it blows up. Why do you think bitcoin was recently pushed down below $7000 and as soon as it was going to break $10,000 a bunch of FUD started getting published.

Yes, regulations are also a reason for the dip since January BUT...

As soon as regulations are set and crypto is made easily accessible through apps like Robinhood, money will start flooding into the crypto space.

Two main issues exist with crypto now that are preventing mass amounts of money from coming in:

FUD
It's complicated to invest!
FUD is manipulated by the media and the bull/bearish nature of the market. So basically media controls things, and who controls media... BUT sooner or later big money is going to want to make those massive returns on their investments, the bear market can't last forever.

Things are getting less complicated on exchanges as well as with new applications that are being developed. Additionally trading desks at banks will be huge in regards to validation as well as ease of investment.

It's only a matter of time...

REASON 3:

HAVE YOU SEEN THE USE CASES FOR BLOCKCHAIN!

Enough said.

If you haven't, I suggest you read more about blockchain...

Maybe start here: https://ci.covesting.io/article/banco-bilbao-vizcaya-argentaria-issues-corporate-l

The purpose of LN. An honest question for the community.,"I have been in a different thread talking about a comment that someone posted that stated ""The purpose of LN is not for $20+ payments"". I have also seen people mention that LN is intended for buying a coffee. Now, whilst every now and then I do buy a coffee, I much more often execute transactions that would fall in the $50-250 price range. If LN was really intended only to serve the sub $20 payment use case, then for me at least, I would find LN more or less useless. Furthermore, I don't see how equally high volume, but more expensive transactions, such as buying gas or groceries, would scale on the block chain, if they are not going to be supported by the LN.

I should point out that I am not talking about the LN in its current state; I am thinking about the ultimate purpose / end game, even if that is years from now.

What I am hoping is that someone can set me straight and say that the ""design intent"" of LN is actually to support any payment that needs to be made virtually instantly (e.g., paying for groceries at a check out) irrespective of the price being paid and that would thus include the gas/groceries use cases.

Obviously buying a car, house, TV etc would be something that could be on the block chain directly. My question is about X, where coffee (LN) &lt; X (?) &lt; Lambo (block chain).",1525143147,01/05/2018 02:52:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g59p1/the_purpose_of_ln_an_honest_question_for_the/,1

US Central Bank Explains How Bitcoin is Like ‘Regular Currency’,"https://www.ccn.com/cftc-chairman-j-christopher-cryptodad-giancarlo-to-retire-after-term-ends-in-2019/


Christine Smith, a content strategist with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, suggests bitcoin is less “exotic” and more boring than people may think. Bitcoin’s two use cases are as a store of value and a currency, the latter of which Smith uses to argue a trio of reasons why the leading digital currency is no different than “regular currency.”

Backed by Nothing
Bitcoin, like the US dollar, isn’t backed by any physical asset like gold. Its value is a consequence of the demand that people place on it, which has currently catapulted the price to about the $9,300 level.



Smith cites Fed economists who previously argued that “bitcoin units have no intrinsic value,” adding that neither does the US dollar, euro or Swiss franc. For instance, paper money is comprised of cotton and linen, which makes it cheap to make.

The US government abandoned the gold standard during the Depression and removed its international ties to the system in the seventies. Since that time, fiat money issued by the Federal Reserve isn’t backed by gold, but your money is still valuable.

While bitcoin is debated to be characterized as a currency, asset or investment, Smith says regardless of how you slice it, “bitcoin units have no intrinsic value.”

Finite Supply
Her next argument is tied to the finite amount of bitcoin that will ever be created. As CCN’s recent reminder said, there’s only 21 million bitcoin in total supply. The supply/demand dynamics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and “shocks” in the demand is what leads to the volatility that this market experiences.

Meanwhile, contrary to popular belief, the Fed doesn’t print money, Smith notes, but instead “increases or decreases the monetary base” (banks’ reserve balances + money in circulation). There’s $1.63 trillion in US currency in circulation, as of the Q1 2018, most of which is comprised of Federal Reserve notes. Smith says that while it may be hard to believe, “scarcity” is at the core of the Fed’s strategy for stability in the monetary system, as “to maintain its value, money must be in limited supply.”

Decentralized
Lastly, she evoked Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision –

“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” — Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper 

While the decentralized nature of bitcoin is what differentiates it from fiat currencies, Smith observes a similarity in the way that cash is spent, “requiring no intermediary to process a transaction.” She concludes with the anonymity feature that is associated with cash.

As for bitcoin, while its founder remains anonymous, its transactions are recorded on a public ledger that’s traceable.",1525149213,01/05/2018 04:33:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g5u5m/us_central_bank_explains_how_bitcoin_is_like/,1

UNICEF Uses cryptomining as a source of donation!!," UNICEF is now making a campaign of cryptomining helping those who are in need!! They made a new page called ""hope page"" were you mine with your CPU and donating hashpower for them which they turn to fiat etc..! Also the campaign is now in UNICEF Australia but I believe it should be more than that to places which are more in need of humanitarian aid like Africa, Vietnam, etc.. Oh! And a cool feature you can control how much your donating from your mining you can mine at different speeds and hashrates! The more you donate the more you help them!

List exchanges which don't use SegWit address? And more important: why?,"Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous Bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, which is currently hovering between 30% á 35% of all transaction that are happening for months.

If Bitcoin users demand SegWit now, we could increase the Segwit adaption on 50% at least. 

So I'm trying to figuring out which exchanges and wallets are still using the old Bitcoin address format (P2PKH which begin with the number 1, eg: 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2 which not supports SegWit), and use Bech32 instead (type starting with bc1, eg: bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq), which is native SegWit address.

Could you tell me which exchanges are still using the non-SegWit addresses for deposit/withdrawal which causes higher fees? ",1525168937,01/05/2018 10:02:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g7b9j/list_exchanges_which_dont_use_segwit_address_and/,1

Fastest way to collect Coinpot on Iphone! (Highest paying Crypto-Faucet),"
If you don't already know, Coinpot is one of the leading Crytpocurrency microwallets today. Not only is it connected with the top 7 highest paying faucets they also give the ability to Convert all Alt-Coins to whichever supported coin you like (all coins are inter-exchangeable). Anyway going through all 7 faucets is tedious and requires abit of effort for desktop users...

It came to my attention a lot of people will claim Coinpot when they can, but have limited access to a desktop computer. If you happen to have an iPhone, I have a workflow widget that only takes 4 minutes to run through but collects all 7 faucets and then a bitcoin lottery after. It’s useful if you travel or go on vacation and want your loyalty intact (sorry androids, I am sure there is something comparable available!)First if you aren’t already, you need to register with coinpot.co

Then download workflow if you don’t already have it for iOS, and use the widget down bottom

To get it working just get workflow from the Apple store (free of course) and then download my widget shortcut below (also free of course)

Workflow by Apple https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8

Check out the workflow I built!

https://workflow.is/workfl…/c0a3b90f89d54327892a270789f96ff1

All you do is run the widget, it loads up browser and you make your first claim, scroll down a little bit and “Done” shows up in the top left, click that and it loads the next page in line. It’s really quick and saves so much time. When you finish it sets a reminder for 1 hour, and next time you run it just asks permission to delete said reminder

This has helped alot of redditors and I have since received very positive feedback! Try it out and let me know what you think in the comments!

Feel free to Like to help out others!

"""Inflation"" of BTC","Hi, I was thinking about this lately... I don't have economic background... So I wanna ask you If my thinking is right...

My laic thinking about inflation of flat currency is...When government will print money.. value of money in circulation is going down...

We can said BTC is not inflation currency ... but after all 21mil coins will be mined...

For now everyday BTC miners ""print"" new coins... and after 2022 they will ""print"" less...

So from 2008 is BTC deflation currency ? And everyday trading can be influence by this factor ?",1525172689,01/05/2018 11:04:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g7ltb/inflation_of_btc/,1

r/Bitcoin recap - April 2018,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I’m back with the sixteenth monthly Bitcoin news recap.


It's easy for news and developments to get drowned out by price talk, so each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in Bitcoin over the past month. Lots of gems this time around!

My ELI5 analogy for how blockchain works.,"Let’s play a game. This game requires Snapchat. The rules are very simple, all you have to do is screenshot my photo and include your Bitmoji avatar dabbing in the bottom left corner. Once you’ve done that send the photo to 1 other friend so they can repeat the process.

Eventually, we get a snap-chain that looks like this:

https://i.imgur.com/2aLURxm.png

You could say each screenshot represents a *block* with its primary data being the Bitmoji avatar.

There’s a problem with this though. Someone could open up the screenshot in photoshop and remove your avatar 😡. There’s also nothing to preventing people from posting an avatar that isn’t dabbing in the bottom left corner. In other words, we need a way to verify that each snap within the snap-chain is legitimate while simultaneously ensuring nobody’s avatar has been tampered.

We could hire a third-party to check and verify every snap, but then how do we know these people have the best interest of the snap-chain at hand? How do we know they won’t be secretly manipulating the snap-chain behind closed doors?

To solve this issue, we’ll offer software available for free via the app store that anybody can download. Everybody that has the software will get real-time updates regarding the snap-chain. Let’s call these people nodes. The job of nodes is to ensure the rules of the game are being properly played and this is done automatically by the software. Everytime a screenshot is taken, it’ll be forwarded to every node in existence to validate or reject if it meets protocol. Only once a majority of nodes approve the snap and reach consensus can the snap be added to the snap-chain. If majority consensus is to reject the snap, it cannot be added to the snap-chain.

In other words, we’ve just created a decentralized and secure method of verifying the snap-chain.

---

And that’s the ELI5 version of how the bitcoin peer-to-peer network works. Obviously it isn’t an all encompassing analogy as it doesn’t take into account mining, but this at least should give you a visual metaphor as to how blockchain functions. The difference being bitcoin’s blockchain stores financial transactions rather than dabbing avatars.

Funds stolen from Binance 6th March.,"Just asking advice. I'm sure everyone remembers the security breech and report that came out from binance re no funds being stolen on the 6th march this year. My account was broken into that day at that exact time and all my alts were sold to bitcoin and withdrawn all in one hit. I emailed binance and they said it wasbt part of the attack ( big coincidence) and it was a result of a phishing attack. Thing is I had been away for a couple months and so my last login before the funds were stolen were on the 29th Jan. I have all documents to support this etc but still binance takes no responsibility.... Suggestions? Can I report this anywhere?

Which Influencers Do You Want To See Interviewed? (I'm a Journalist),"Hi,

I write in the crypto space, mostly for [CCN](https://muckrack.com/conor-maloney/articles). I'm reaching out to some figures I'm interested in to cover their work, and it just occurred to me that there a whole bunch of people I could ask to weigh in as well \- you. Often figures will simply do an AMA, which I really love \- it's great seeing people interact with the community they influence directly. Of course, this usually involves hundreds of questions and can take all day, so not everyone has the time or inclination to do it.

I'm reaching out to Nick Szabo, A. Antonopoulos, and others to update the community on their projects and thoughts on the current status of the crypto space. Who do you want to see covered? Who do you want to hear from, and what do you want to know? I'll get in touch with them, and this might also spark AMAs or direct responses from the influencers themselves here on Reddit as well, all of which would be great \- so drop a comment if there's someone you want to learn more about!

Imagine,"I'm a HODLer since about 2014, but I'd also like to be SPEDNer and an EARNer \(damn!, no ""D"" in ""earn""\). To get there, I am asking the following questions every chance I get:

1. To perspective employers: can I be paid in Bitcoin?
2. To merchants: can I pay you in Bitcoin?
3. To independent contractors that I hire: can I pay you in Bitcoin?

Bitcoin Meetup Malta Is Back. And Sold Out.,"Summer is coming and it's just a few more days until the ladies will consider the water to be warm enough - then the beach season is officially starting here in Malta.

But let's talk about our efforts to make Malta a Blockchain Island. (Note, Bitcoin Island wasn't winning the PR fight against ""Blockchain Island"" so far, if you follow the news.)

This Thursday the Bitcoin Club Malta is hosting a Bitcoin Meetup and apparently it's already fully booked. Since the last meetup was back in January and things happen extremely fast nowadays, over 80 people signed up for the networking event within days and the space is limited.

The Bitcoin Club will livestream on it's Facebook site for those abroad and we for those in Malta we are looking forward to see you at the Meetup.

Be welcomed to visit Malta and stay tuned :)

Are Bitcoin miners processing Bitcoin transactions or solving complex math problems?,"So I am a bit confused on what Bitcoin mining actually is. I've heard that mining Bitcoin is essentially solving complex math problems which reward the ""miner"" with Bitcoins. I've also heard Bitcoin mining is the act of processing Bitcoin transactions which make up the blocks in the blockchain. 

So if you're mining Bitcoin are you actually processing the transactions? How does mining work on crypto coins that have little to no transactions? How can the miners still receive regular block rewards for mining if there's not enough transactions to fill a block?",1525198423,01/05/2018 18:13:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gakst/are_bitcoin_miners_processing_bitcoin/,1

Telling my grandkids how it took a few decades for people to want to be rich using bitcoin,"It was the 2010's.  People were using fiat.  Money that inflates and goes down in value since 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created.

Bitcoin emerged in 2009 but it took a few years for it to get mainstream attention.  A small portion of the population knew that bitcoin was a currency/asset/unit of account that would evolutionize money.  

Instead of a few people being rich, EVERYBODY could be rich.  The masses did not seem to care in the first decade or so.  They were so lulled into their fiat-induced coma that they succumbed to a life of rising grocery/rent prices every year.  

Eventually however, the masses saw all their cohorts transcending their dependence on big corporations for jobs, big govt for welfare hand-outs, etc.  They too were tired of the top-down imposed poverty of the people.  Once this mindset hit, it did not take long for the entire world's financial system to change overnight.  Fiat plunged, bitcoin mooned.  Everybody learned the value of saving.  Everybody learned the value of each second in life.  Every word they uttered, every movement they made.  Nothing was taken for granted.  Consumerism dropped as people realized the value of their savings would go up as long as they HODLed.  Bitcoin became a savings grace for humanity.  A true gift from God.

About Warren Buffet articles...,"Warren Buffet's endless criticism on Bitcoin is becoming rather boring than relevant. 
In a recent interview with CNBC Mr. Buffet admits he regretted not believing in Amazon years ago, going as far as saying he was too dumb to realise it’s potential. 
Same approach for companies like Google, Xerox, Apple etc..., he didn't want to invest in something he didn't understand. These young talented freshmen had a clear vision but had to fight and persevere as they received little or no institutional fundings, often developing their ideas in their moms' garage. The support initially came from daring entrepreneurs that believed in the potential, even when nothing was proven yet. Countless college graduates indeed jumped on the boat and got very wealthy developing their business around those new technologies, I doubt many elderly people gave it a toss.

With all respect for his successful career and the great insights he had in his era, one could ask if he can still catch up the way society evolves around him. What were his thoughts when social media came up for example? Or imagine telling your grandpa his transistor radio would soon be replaced by a wireless device that plays any music where and whenever he wants 15 years ago.
It’s dissapointing that a man who used to have such great insights is arguing against something that totally surpasses his understanding, with examples of buying a farm. 
I understand people of his age find it difficult to even send a picture but the millennial generation will be perfectly able to integrate digital currencies into their everyday lives and get rid of those annoying pieces of paper and metal coins. Then there's decentralized internet, even those who do believe in it probably cannot imagine the potential yet, but that's another topic.

Oh and the intrinsic value gibberish... Consider other things people invest in like let's say paintings: if they’re into it and have the money, sure, enjoy it, hang it in your mansion or lend it to museums and have everyone applaud you for it, but how many pieces are just bought for exuberant amounts by some Saudi Arabian prince who barely looks at it and locks it in a vault? 
What’s the use of that other than hoping someone else will buy it for more like our friend the oracle says about cryptocurrency, no difference, it’s what you do with it.
Digital currency is here to stay old man.

In order to make it easier for people to participate in the network, it should be easier for people to run full nodes.

Quantum Resistance Question,"I have read that quantum resistance can be added by changing the signature to a quantum resistance signature and switching to a better hash function to prevent QCs from hijacking mining power.

However, wouldn't it still be possible to modify old blocks? For example, what stops a quantum computer from playing around with transactions in an old block to, say, modify the recipient of the mining reward, and then find a combination of values in header/transaction body to create the same hash that was calculated in the initial, valid block? Since there are so many possible Bitcoin  wallet addresses, they could treat that as the nonce and iterate through unused Bitcoin wallets as the miner destination. If the hash doesnt change, the entire blockchain would stay valid, and if they can convince others to adopt their chain, wouldn't they be able to ""modify"" the past? 

I'm sure I'm missing something, so what measures are there that prevent this or will prevent this? Is it mathematically impossible?",1525219229,02/05/2018 00:00:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gd3zu/quantum_resistance_question/,1

Common misconceptions and other random thoughts and observations from an investment professional,"Hey community, wanted to share some random thoughts on this exciting time we live in. Unprecedented tear in XBTUSD finally dialing down which is usually a good time for more reflective thought and discussion (vs when things are moving vertically either direction and everyone is freaking out).

--disclaimer and background--

I am not really a frequent Reddit user so bear with me if I'm getting some things wrong here. Not too keen on giving away much personal detail for obvious reasons, so I do not have a compelling way to convince you to believe that I'm not an imposter (and this is healthy - it is generally a good idea to be extremely skeptical of anything anyone says to you when it relates to investing). Anyway, I work at a large size investment firm directly in the capacity of investment strategy and analysis, and I wanted to share some views from the other side. Note that the street is generally a very diverse community with countless differing perspectives, so I should clarify that this is only one perspective from an industry that is literally hinged on trying to make money by having a unique perspective.

Going to go ahead and say that I am not licensed in any way shape or form to actually provide direct financial or wealth management advice to individuals (ironic isn't it?) so please only use anything in this thread as a reference point and nothing more. You can roll your eyes, but the main reason I'm here is because I personally have a serious issue when people provide financial advice/analysis (no matter how good, thoughtful, or experienced they may be) that others then take directly to drive personal decisions without fully understanding how much they could get hurt. For all intents and purposes please just consider everything I say to just be purely an opinion.

----

Anyway somber bullshit aside, let's jump into it. No particular order - just random thoughts as they come up.

**Status quo investment community views on Bitcoin**? Generally Bitcoin is disregarded and not taken seriously. The entire market cap of this asset class is maybe a few hundred billion, and the largest shops literally have trillions in assets to deploy, so any one of them could literally just buy into all of it and it would barely even take up much of their overall portfolio of holdings - and if you think about it, buying up an entire crypto is kinda nonsensical... imagine someone just bought all the gold in the world so that nobody could ever use or trade it and just left it in a vault...

Honestly, very few people pay extensive attention to Bitcoin and even fewer are intimidated that it will structurally overhaul society. If anything, there's probably lots of hope for Bitcoin to get bigger so that institutional money can actually get into it. Smaller shops are more nimble and have smaller capital bases that they can deploy into less competitive markets (e.g. small caps, niche, etc.) where you can beat out retail investors that invest part time a lot easier than the trillions floating around managed by overcompetitive professionals.

Note: To clarify, not taken seriously for institutional investment. Lots of guys buy/bet on random stuff with their personal accounts - sports, cryptos, and there's always some numpty that likes to buy scratch cards just because.

**Fed and Wall St collusion?** Seems to be a lot of sentiment that financial regulators, central banks, etc. exist to serve and collude the financial industry. Couldn't be further from the truth - the regulators are mainly what stands between highly sophisticated professionals from preying on literally everyone else. Literally the exact same way as FDA watching our backs from chemists/pharmaceutical companies and any other field where the average person simply cannot hope to fully understand the inner workings of that industry (If there was no FDA, I as a plebian non-doctor non-chemist non-pharmacist would be terrified). As retail investors, you want to as much power in the hands of regulators as possible, and I can say the disassembly of regulation would be a dream come true for Wall St. - I won't get into why. And look there's always going to be cases of conflict of interest/corruption/misaligned interests, but broadly speaking these govt institutions are in place to represent interests of the common folk, and not the real life Bobby Axelrods of the world (yes Billions is a guilty pleasure of mine, and no it is not a great depiction of how it actually works)**

**Recession/TARP/corruption? General consensus across the board is that TARP needed to happen, because a complete confidence collapse causes irreversible structural damage that would devastate a lot of people, but especially the average Joe. Sure, Mr. Hedge Fund had the most (objectively) to lose, but he is still going to have his Ferrari no matter how bad the system collapses, but the regular guy working his 9-5 doesn't have a cash stack to fall onto. Govt still has some loans that have not been paid off, but net net they came ahead something like $50B profit just a few years after they deployed capital. Again let me reiterate there was actually a lot of opposition on this side of the circus at the time as well - a lot of institutions were forced to take capital injections for a herd-immunity-like mechanic because if only select institutions took funding it would be identified as the next Lehman ready to die and the market would devour it. Imagine being the guy running a perfectly healthy business and never taking the reckless positions that your peers did and having to take a billion dollars in debt (and significant interest expenses) just because your colleagues were doing stupid things and you are literally obligated to take it.**

**Bitcoin/cryptos to replace fiat? Down with the old corrupt system?** Maybe potentially in some other shape or form (so many technical flaws with Bitcoin - even lightning and other incremental mods feel like bandaid workarounds and if a crypto were to become primary means of exchange I would be surprised if it is just good old Bitcoin), but you will never escape govt regulation. Silk road was a good example - if the govt has any reason to believe there is unregulated/criminal transactions they will assemble full force teams and RICO everything you have ever touched so fast that your head will spin. Remember that CIA/FBI/police/etc. are all agencies that generally are put into place and designed by the public. We elect sheriffs the same way we self-patrol fraudulent behavior on Reddit and ultimately the need to monitor and regulate currency is driven by something the people want. Again there's always going to be controversies and scandals like NSA revelations and whatnot, but the reason these enforcement agencies exist is because the idea of living in a world where someone could threaten to hurt your family and demand a Bitcoin ransom or pay some hitman to pick off your loved ones until you wire them your life savings is horrifying. Ultimately it is we, us, whether on Wall St. or Main St. that want regulation and protection, and as individuals I think that we will demand that X oversight or regulation infrastructure is put in place to ensure that. There is ALWAYS analogue gap, and it can be as simple as making it hugely illegal to not provide crypto transaction data voluntarily to the govt in the same way being caught literally just possessing a gun with a shaved-off serial number will get you in serious trouble. It comes down to what kind of world we collectively want to live in, and I think that regulation is inevitable because it is something we all align.**

**Bitcoin is a good long-term investment?** I have no idea. I have been following BTC since ~2013 and it still doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Maybe because even gold doesn't make sense to me. But generally as a non-value-producing asset class (i.e. it literally doesn't grow itself as an entity the way a share of a company does), it can't be that much more different than gold, which I generally perceive as more of a store of value that mainly gets interest during a panic where money is looking for a flight to safety. At this point BTC is driven far more by market sentiment and random govt decisions, which makes it barely discernible from a coin toss.**

**Bitcoin/crypto more fair? No corrupt hedgies preying on people?** No I think it's actually a lot worse. Look at the spreads that exchanges charge on it - they are horrifyingly large. There's probably a handful of people that collect spreads on this entire industry and they are making a stupid amount of money. I have also anecdotal evidence that there is very sophisticated capital that is arbing the market because it is simultaneously so liquid and held widely by retail investors, although the lack of liquidity means they are tripling a few million every day rather than making 50% returns on billions. And sorry, but technical analysis is absolute garbage and empirically worse than just blind guessing - lots of university papers written here. Advanced machines and algos trade literally every market and they can do infinitely more rigorous and intense calculations on technical factors than any human being could even hope to achieve. False prophets at every turn with technicals, and truth is you will always lose against the team of MIT/Caltech flash boys that are writing equations on glass walls to outmaneuver you in these markets.

Most importantly my bet is that whoever who runs these exchanges is probably frontrunning the market on top of their massive fees. Revelations like government officials trading cryptos ahead of announcing policy that they literally made can cost certain individuals their jobs, but the reality is that the market is so totally unregulated and it's unclear who has access to what data and since it is not illegal to manipulate XBTUSD in all the ways that it is illegal for real markets, I would go ahead and say that even if I tried my hand to crack the Bitcoin market, I am going to lose (BADLY) to a dedicated team running strategies professionally, and any other players that have a fix on the market.

Asymmetry and unregulated markets disadvantage the retail investor far more than they disadvantage most sophisticated capital. This only gets masked if you have something that increased 9000000% because everyone is ""making"" money.

**How to get better at investing?**

Read everything. Learn everything. Criticize and be skeptical of everything. This industry is a winner-take-all environment, and everyone is fighting to get that incremental edge. Assume that anyone that volunteers information has an ulterior motive, because they do. If someone is in the middle of panic-selling their holdings, do you think they'll say ""you should sell too"" to strangers so that they can be crowded out of their liquidation? Be wary of advice or analysis from ANYONE because they have nothing to gain from helping you, but lots to gain by misleading you. Beyond that, some people are just idiots and their intentions aren't malevolent, but they're useless and will feed you irrelevant information.

If you're doing this right you should be actively scanning this text and trying to figure out why I am writing what I am - what kind of trick could I be trying to pull to manipulate strangers into something that garners me personal gain? There's so many layers, you need to discern and always be watching for people that are obviously trying to manipulate you. You shouldn't trust me one bit. I have absolutely nothing to gain from sharing my ""advice."" Apply this to everything you hear and read (including your ""friends""), then go read literally everything that has been written. Then you will start to see the matrix and truly understand how the market looks.

**Do you believe in Bitcoin?**

Blockchain tech will revolutionize the world. 100%. Already seeing it manifest in certain ways in other industries. I don't know about cryptos. I definitely don't like XBTUSD as a trade. There's a very snotty saying on the street but it rings true time and time again: the moment you hear janitors, truck drivers and your grandma talking about an investment, it's time to get the fuck out of it. Or, alternatively, the moment you see an investment idea on TV or on the news or on any major public platform (cough), this is your time to sell. And it's true - unsophisticated investors are your ride to lock in gains while selling out, and the moment the masses realize there are no more gains left to be had the bottom drops out and it collapses. I know this community hates references to BTC as a bubble, but it has had so much similarity to other similar cases as well as media attention/mainstream coverage profile as other instances. It feels like a pennystock to me, and while there's riches to be made, it's not where I would want to really try and bet on seriously.

However, you cannot deny that BTC is somewhat sticky. There's something cool there that makes it more than just an ""idea"" from a random pennystock pump, and it's definitely something cool to hold a bit on if you want to support the general idea. For real, actually attractive risk-adjusted returns, I would look elsewhere (honestly with the investment sizes most people would be better off trading things around on Craigslist or something)

**BING. Could this whole thread be written by someone from Craigslist trying to boost traffic?** The moment I wrote that your alarm bells should be ringing. Again, read everything but trust no one. Why the fuck did this guy say ""you could probably make more money on _ than BTC?"" Stay vigilant. The world isn't evil and out to get you, but everyone does something for a reason. (In my case I just vomited on the page and noticed it sounded funny/odd. I have no idea of Craigslist is a profitable side-hobby... personally I would be afraid of getting stabbed.)

Those are all my random thoughts for now. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Please post on the thread as I have a strong belief in public dissemination of information and would like to share any responses broadly. It's an exciting time we live in, so have fun, but please make design your playbook responsibly and invest with discipline.",1525223500,02/05/2018 01:11:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gdk0i/common_misconceptions_and_other_random_thoughts/,1

Peter Thiel's Tagomi System has a very interesting name,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-backed-venture-to-help-big-investors-bet-on-bitcoin-1525176121

Tagomi itself is a ""fake"" Japanese name without real Chinese characters behind it. It appears only in Philip K. Dick's ""The Man in the High Castle"". It seems to me Peter must be a fan of that novel (and we now have an Amazon Prime show too). And if you are familiar with the story, Tagomi is a man with the ability to travel between parallel universes.

In some sense, Satoshi is very similar to ""the man in the high castle"", changing the world with a white paper.",1525238568,02/05/2018 05:22:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gf00n/peter_thiels_tagomi_system_has_a_very_interesting/,1

A little bit about my situation:

So days ago I arrived in Indonesia. I have to admit I was really looking forward to it all. Wasn't long before my situation started turning for the worst, I spent a night in a hotel accompanied by some friends.

... Then that was it, last I recall. Some heavy hitting drink left me dazed and confused and in a completely different location to what I recall.

Left with just my everyday wallet, ATM card and my mobile phone. All cash emptied from my wallet, I had roughly about 100aud in cash left on my bank card. Now 0.

Ive been cursed at, spat at and threatened. I encourage all to never visit this place.

So here I am, sitting in a hotel lobby purely for the use of the free wifi.

Fuck I just want to break someone.",1525240750,02/05/2018 05:59:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gf6cf/stuck_in_indonesia/,1

My little suggestion on buying/selling coins during fluctuation...,"There is a simple way to make money with cryptocurrency: buy potential crypto at a very low price and wait for the skyrocket. As we all know, the price fluctuates randomly, usually we miss the change to buy the coins we want due to our hesitation, and do not sell the coin that should be given up for we always have some imagination that such coins will raise again! Eventually we have trapped ourselves. That’s why we need to have our own investment logic: buying or selling coins for a reason, and we should have a bottom line for your loss---once, supposedly, the loss has exceeded your expectation, we should take action to stop it. In this way, we can deal with any kind of coins fluctuation to keep our capital safe and make more profit.",1525250113,02/05/2018 08:35:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gfv9e/my_little_suggestion_on_buyingselling_coins/,1

US Judge Rejects Alibaba Infringement Motion to Block ‘Alibabacoin’ Cryptocurrency,"A U.S. federal judge rejected Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd.’s move to block Dubai cryptocurrency firm Alibabacoin Foundation from using the Alibaba name for its Alibabacoin virtual currency.

In his ruling, Judge Paul Oetken of the Southern District of New York (i.e., Manhattan) denied Alibaba’s motion on jurisdictional grounds, saying it failed to show that the use of the Alibabacoin name would hurt its business prospects in New York or would infringe its trademarks in New York.

Surprisingly, the judge said it didn’t matter that Alibabacoin might eventually be listed on a New York exchange.

Judge: No Infringement In New York
Judge Oetken said any damage to Alibaba’s business or reputation from the allegedly infringing use of the Alibaba name occurs in China, not in New York. A U.S. federal judge has no jurisdiction on legal issues that occur in a foreign country.

Alibabacoin contends that China’s ban on initial coin offerings eliminates any possibility that consumers in China will be confused into thinking the Alibabacoin is associated with Alibaba Group.

In a statement on May 1, 2018, Alibabacoin said the judge made the right decision, tweeting: “We firmly believe that Alibabacoin Foundation never acted illegally. Fair and square speaking, we strongly believe and trust the judge’s decision above all else.”

Alibaba Group had sued Alibabacoin Foundation in April 2018, claiming the foundation was unlawfully piggybacking off its name to promote its cryptocurrency.

Alibabacoin: Alibaba Can’t Monopolize Name
Alibabacoin Foundation (also known as ABBC) responded by filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Alibaba Group cannot monopolize the “magical” Alibaba name, Reuters reported.

“The legend of Alibaba conjures up thoughts of magic, gold coins, and ‘Open Sesame,’” the Alibabacoin Foundation argued. “The ABBC entities are well within their rights to use a word connoting magic and golden coins in an area (Alibaba) has not used or, at the very least, has abandoned.”

Interestingly, Alibaba Group’s CEO Jack Ma is a bitcoin skeptic who has expressed concerns over its opaqueness and potential for use in money-laundering, as CCN has reported.

“Bitcoin is not for me,” Ma said. “We are not focused on bitcoin. We are focused on a cashless society for China…trying to make sure the society is more efficient, more transparent, with no corruption.”



Despite his bearishness about bitcoin, Jack Ma is bullish on blockchain. Lynx International, a subsidiary of Alibaba, has successfully integrated blockchain into its cross-border logistics operations.

And it’s likely that Alibaba Group will continue to incorporate blockchain technology into its vast business empire, whose 2017 revenue topped $22 billion.",1525259958,02/05/2018 11:19:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ggmjt/us_judge_rejects_alibaba_infringement_motion_to/,1

#Bitcoin #Price#Analysis," Yesterday bitcoin marked a high of $9240 and a low of $8829.It has again tested the grand trend line but could not break and also closed below it. Now prices are moving at $9125 which is at 23&amp;#37; Fibonacci retracement \($6380 to $9990\)this level is very important. If it breaks then prices can jumped upward and might test $9670 and $10500. I can see from the charts the prices are above from the junction point \(cross of grand and rising trend lines given below the chart\). Today it is showing a bullish trend.

moving money out your country. And tax.,"So SARS (south African revenue service)  has recently gone and said that Bitcoin will be taxed as an asset.  Is there a way around this? And it's annoying because I thought Bitcoin was a way out of this corrupt money pyramid. 

Also- Say your country only lets you take R2million with you when you immigrate. If you put all your money into a crypto currency can you escape the limit? So if I have R10million- I convert it to crypto and then convert it back to money when I get to the new country. Is this possible?

Let us decide which speculations have some salt to them and which are completely baseless!,"I first got into crpto in December last year. Used reddit as my main research tool, reading user opinions and then looking at white papers. I preferred projects with strong fundamentals rather than just hype and invested in req, mod, amb, fct, icx. But like many others didn't take profits when it was time. This time around i wanted to invest in projects which had some speculations and rumours going about them which could result in short term spikes. Like, there's this microcap linx and there were speculations as to the lead developer could be david grant or Tiesto. So i went around searching for coins with speculations running around on reddit, bitcointalk but it was tough. So over the past week, i created this website [https://www.coinmarketrumour.com](https://www.coinmarketrumour.com) . Here anyone can anonymously post any rumour or speculation and people can vote on it, search for speculations by tags etc. There are a ton of more features that can be added but i wanted to know if its even useful to the community before i spend more time on it. So, guys please take a look and let me know any feedback you have on it.

US Tax Discussion," I've been reading a lot of posts over the past several months about cryptocurrency tax liabilities and implications. The general idea of what people are considering taxable seems to have shifted from last year. I remember a lot of people last year and years prior saying that only crypto to fiat trades are taxable. There are several arguments to this but one, more aggressive, position that many are taking is to not report coin\-to\-coin trades because the IRS won't ever receive any information about them. This, however, is based on the hope that the exchange won't release any information to the IRS in the future. Many people think that they wont but it would be worth thinking about the following question: Will the exchange protect traders and promote anonymity before protecting themselves as business? While I do think the primary fiat gateways like Coinbase and Gemini are the first ones on the radar, more and more exchanges are wanting to add USD pairs, so, eventually they might be in the same situation.

It would have been ideal for the IRS to issue even better guidance than what they released in 2014. In my opinion, if people are still finding points to argue, then the current guidance is not sufficient. Plain and simple. No one would try to argue a stance on not reporting typical stock trades because all of that is already detailed in the IRC and all of the points get covered.

I think that not reporting could complicate things more than many people think. One issue is cost basis. If someone had trades in years prior and never reported them, what cost basis would they use when they eventually cash out their BTC? What if someone initally bought 1 BTC, then traded around alts and at the current point in time actually had less than the 1 BTC they first purchased. If they never reported coin\-to\-coin trades but want to start reporting something, there really isn't any way to justify the cost basis unless that person went back to amend prior year tax returns. If the IRS were to receive a return that claimed a cost basis that doesn't seem to line up with prior year returns, then that could lead to more questions. If the person now wants to wait until they accumulate that original 1 BTC again through alt trading and then cash out the 1 BTC to report and pay tax in an honest effort, now LT and ST capital gains need to be considered. If it has been more than 1 year since they bought that 1 BTC and now they want to cash out 1 BTC, then it could look like its a LTCG. However, since alts were traded around, it's probably a STCG. If they want to cash out whatever BTC they have currently, even if its less, then if records to were to be released later, it would appear as though that person is still holding some BTC, even though they sold it all. They would have to declare LTCG though, unless they show all alt trades. I dont really see a way to justify this although I do think that this could possibly be a semi\-conservative strategy if the goal is to start reporting everything and to begin paying tax on all trades from that point forward due to prior confusion. Amending prior year returns to include gains could come with high penalty and interest charges. Also, claiming 0 cost basis due to records not being kept, the expense of an accounting firm to figure the gains out, etc, etc, could lead to more questions but I guess its possible that the IRS accepts this if a reasonable case is presented.

For those that say that in 2018 they are reporting everything but aren't or didn't do so for 2017 and before, what starting point would they use? 0 cost basis and date received as 1/1/2018?",1525282319,02/05/2018 17:31:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gj8r5/us_tax_discussion/,1

Mnemonic seed cold storage - splitting?,"One thing has me stressed about storing the mnemonic seed for an HD wallet \(like for a trezor or ledger\) is that it's a single point of failure. If someone finds the seed they can easily steal my entire portfolio. It doesn't require that someone specifically be looking for it... if a snooping teenager finds it in a drawer or a burglar takes it along with all the other stuff in a safe then the wallet is compromised, quite possibly \(especially with a snooper\) before I can move my currency out of it.

One solution is splitting the seed. For a 24 word seed this seems pretty simple \- split it in two, with 12 words in one location and 12 words in another location. The problem with that is that we again have a single point of failure \- in some ways it's even worse, as the loss of one of the two halves means that the entire wallet is lost forever \(unless I can somehow brute force a 12 word mnemonic\).

One solution that I saw on reddit is splitting into thirds with redundancy. For example:

1. the first third would have words 1\-16 \(out of 24\)
2. the second third would have words 9\-24
3. the final third would have words 1\-8 and 17\-24

This way, even if one out of the three thirds was lost I'd still have the entire seed.

One issue: this means that despite a potential snooper or burglar not having the entire mnemonic seed, they would have 2/3 of it. If they could figure out the final 8 words, they'd be all set.

So my question: if an attacker had 16 out of 24 words and knew which they were \(so they knew that they had words 1\-8 and 17\-24, for example\), how possible is brute forcing the final 8 words? I know I can add a ""25th word"" in the form of a passphrase, but let's assume there is no passphrase. I also know that the 24th word is a checksum \- if they have the 24th word as part of their 16 does that help in the brute forcing?

Anyone have any ideas?",1525285731,02/05/2018 18:28:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gjoj3/mnemonic_seed_cold_storage_splitting/,1

Why African millennials can't get enough of Bitcoin,"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-

Bitcoin's eye-watering price surge over the past year is proving too tempting to resist despite fears that cryptocurrencies are a bubble floating towards an inevitable burst. One group for whom it holds particular appeal is African millennials, writes the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga from Uganda.
Thirty year-old Peace Akware in Kampala is a convert to the 
""I check my Bitcoin every day and any chance I can get.
Any minute, any hour, anytime, as often as I can,"" she tells me from the small bungalow she rents on the outskirts of Kampala.

Peace Akware
Image caption
Peace Akware is hoping to buy a car with the money she makes from Bitcoin
Finding a job here is almost like a lottery for graduates so Ugandans often have so-called side hustles.
Peace has sold clothes and even got into money lending. Both failed.
But buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin appeals to her because it requires less of her time and there are no upfront costs.
She's bought more than a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin.
So far the gamble is paying off and overall she is seeing her digital value rise.
""You know there's potential for it growing even further. I would like to buy a car. I would like to buy land. I would like to build with it.""
Disrupting remittances
It's not just those hoping to get rich quick who are getting in on the action.
In parts of the continent - especially commercial hubs like Lagos, Nairobi and Johannesburg - a small but growing number of people are finding that cryptocurrencies offer a cheaper solution to an expensive problem - transferring funds across borders.
The technology platform Bitpesa uses Bitcoin as a medium to transfer cash across borders.
It is like a remittance company.
With traditional remittance companies like Western Union, when you transfer money initially it goes from your local currency into dollars then on the other side they receive dollars which are then converted into the local currency.
You lose a lot of money in that conversion.
What Bitpesa does is substitute the dollars with Bitcoin.
It is cheaper, especially when there is a shortage of dollars in the country or restrictions on accessing dollars.
It is also quicker because you don't have to go through long complicated bank approvals.cryptocurrency craze.
Like any self-respecting middle class millennial here her smartphone is always within reach and with it her digital wallet.

Capital gains on miner fees and LN fees,"My understanding is that a miner fee is a payment to the miner for processing the transaction and for securing the network. And as such, that payment incurs capital gains. But I do not know how LN transaction fees are documented for me, especially if it goes through multiple hops. I fully expect those fees to be so small that the capital gains are negligent for tax reporting purposes. I would still like to be able to document those fees, and understand how it works.

"Coinbase - Selling and Buying are different prices, even though they charge huge fees? WTH?","Hello,

I know everyone loves to hate Coinbase, and I think this is another reason ... I noticed that when you BUY on Coinbase, not only is the BUY price higher than what is live on GDAX (their back end trading exchange), but they also charge a fee on TOP of that higher price.

However, if you SELL on Coinbase, at the same moment, the SELL price is LESS, and they still charge a fee.

For example, I noticed right now when the price on GDAX is $9250, a BUY BITCOIN price is 9296.  At the SAME time, if I SELL Bitcoin, the SELL price is $9203.  LESS than the BUY price, but also LESS than GDAX.  On both transactions, the Coinbase FEE is about $140.

It's not a lot, but in a given day, it adds up to a LOT of extra for them...this seems like a really big deal.

fungibility and block height,"I was reading about privacy and fungibility properties of Bitcoin, and how because of the currently inherent traceability of Bitcoin the coin is not really fungible because the history of each coin can be traced, and all the efforts ongoing to counter that.

But wouldn't the proof of work itself deminish fungibility of the coin itself? Because the deeper an unspent output was mined / transacted in the blockchain the more valuable it is because more work is needed to attack it (that was my reasoning), or am I missing somethin?

So to sum up, does it count as privacy not disclosing the block height of the utxo?

This *blockhain* thing is hard to understand sometimes xD",1525303493,02/05/2018 23:24:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8glveo/fungibility_and_block_height/,1

Info on booking flights with BTC/alts,"Hi everybody,

Just looking for some feedback/info on booking flights \- I've seen some suggestions around in various subreddits for different sites \- I think I will probably use [cheapair.com](https://cheapair.com)

First question; has anyone booked and successfully made a flight that has been booked with BTC or alts? I know it's been around for a while on a lot of sites, but since we're still in an early adoption phase it's just a personal resistance barrier mentally than just going the traditional buy with credit card/fiat. Any recommendations on other sites with 'travel with crypto' or 'crypto as payment' options.

Second question; I've got a secret plan in the works to fly my wife's parents over from Canada to Australia for Christmas \(she doesn't read reddit, so should be safe!\), and I would love to make that booking and pay for it with crypto. I haven't really been able to find any info on whether there needs to be some additional proof provided so that this would go off without a hitch.

So, do you think it will be possible to book a flight for someone else, using crypto...and there be no issues with any of the above, \(considering I won't be travelling with them\)? Obviously I wouldn't want this to be something that doesn't work out. TBH I haven't ever booked a flight for someone else who I wasn't also travelling with, so I suppose I have a bit of naivety...I believe it's rarer now for 'proof of purchase' \(i.e. present the credit card/payment receipt\) especially through 3rd party sites...but since there is a lot at stake here I'd love some reassurance.

I will probably contact them \[cheapair\] on the side, but just wanted to put this out here as well, has anyone gone through this process?",1525313819,03/05/2018 02:16:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gmz9r/info_on_booking_flights_with_btcalts/,1

Titan Mint Coin Question,"Hi all, 

I was just wondering if anybody out there might be able to help me with a little bit of an issue that I have. I actually am one of the old Bitcoin physical coin collectors and actually purchased some of Titan mint coins several years ago. Recently I decided to go ahead and take a good audit of what all I had in terms of digital assets and came across a website that allowed me to explore the different Bitcoin addresses that I have and see what the Bitcoin Forks associated with those addresses were. Well you can imagine my surprise when that website showed that I was not eligible for any of the Bitcoin cash Forks for the Titan mint coins. Now I did a little bit of research online and I found that there were some  kind of problems related to the two-factor authentication coins. Neither of these coins that I purchased were supposed to be two-factor authenticator coins but rather coins that have the private key simply embedded under the sticker. Either way I was just wondering if the community has had any experience with these Titan mint coins and whether they to have had issues trying to redeem Bitcoin cash under these coins. It should also be noted that I am not attempting to redeem these coins, but rather and attempting to understand what my digital assets are and what Forks that my assets are eligible for. Thanks in advance for your support.",1525319082,03/05/2018 03:44:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gnhoj/titan_mint_coin_question/,1

Reddit I created a very advanced alerting and coin-tracking app. It's free. Please give me feedback.,"Hi Reddit, my name is Ari. I created **Bitcoin CrazYness** App. It started from a few script for personal trading use and evolved to this app. 

It is currently completely free and has many advanced features useful for beginner and intermediate traders:

* Interactive charts with MACD, RSI, Ichimoku, Moving Averages, Stochastic, TD Sequential, and Pivot Points
* **Indicator alert** on any coin: Recurring alerts whenever indicators such as MACD, RSI, and Ichimoku indicate buy or Sell 
* Limit and Delta alerts on **price**, **market cap**, or **volume** for every coin
* Total Market: Delta or limit alert on **total cryptocurrency market cap**
* Personalize alerts by adding **emojis** to them: 🚀🌙
* Coin tracking. True gain/loss calculation. Profit and diversity charts.


And before you ask, the app is published by a small startup company in California, USA, which I am part of. It doesn't access any of your files, passwords, or contact list. Every version is reviewed by Apple and Google before being published on App store. It doesn't run in background, and it requires minimum permissions.

I would appreciate  any feedback.

Bitcoin Bills,"I am thinking about the development of ""Bitcoin bills"", since unfortunately many people still do not have access to the internet or are completely ignorant of digital technology, but I think everyone should participate in the bonanzas of this revolution.
Well I've been thinking of something like this ... A fintec would provide a multsig address and the printing of the ""bitcoin bills"", the address would be 2/3 where one key would get the fintec the other with the advice of the interested traders and merchants, and the other with some type of consumer representative ... Well, the traders at the end of a given period could redeem the bitcoins after presenting the Bills to fintec, likewise some consumers. What do you guys think ??? Bitcoins BILLS would work???

Hybridized Cryptocurrency Mining for Unrelated Pursuits (Aka - Bitcoin Hot Tub),"Good afternoon,

I offered this idea to one of Draper's firms and got shot down.

I am a man with little to lose, and without the means to bring this to market - so I give this idea to the community now.

It's possible to harness the waste heat from ASICs to do productive work.

I'll be happy to answer any questions. I'm also available for hire in the USA. I have many applications for this that could easily reduce the cost basis for certain energy-intensive businesses to near-zero.

The ""hot tub"" in this picture achieved a temperature of over 116F, well beyond the 105F I can tolerate. Ambient temperature was around 80F.

Make me proud.

Where to find affiliate marketers for bitcoin-related businesses?,"Greetings,

I am a marketing manager at one of the biggest online betting websites in the world. Our whole system uses crypto, and we've grown to the point where we have a team of almost fifty people working full-time from all different backgrounds and nationalities.

However, I've been given the task of increasing our numbers of partners. Firstly, our conditions are great (we have an online system for partners where they can check their earnings, comissions averaging 20%, plus guaranteed weekly payments) but I haven't had much luck due to my inexperience in the field. I search for bitcoin-related websites (in English, Spanish and Portuguese), send them an email, but very rarely do I get an answer. Plus, it seems like such websites rarely have a phone number which makes contacting them that much harder.

With the rise of crypto-related businesses, it seems like the demand is greater than the supply when it comes to potential partners (both websites and individuals). What are your methods when it comes to acquiring affiliate marketers? Are there databases publicly available? What media channels do you use? I'm really curious.

APIs and Holding Ratios,"Good morning all,

I thought I'd share some results from a little experimentation. Right now I am holding a certain ratio of USDT:BTC on an exchange and have found that by increasing or decreasing that ratio, there is an immediate and noticeable API driven momentum change. So basically I noticed that if I keep a 1:1.5 ratio of USDT to BTC, the price didn't nosedive or moon. Finding this out helped me decrease my trading volume and makes me less likely to panic sell. It's possible that it could also be triggered by the amount of BTC in the trader's wallet, but mine is so small I doubt that's likely. I figure as long as the exchanges are manipulating the markets, we could learn their manipulations and use it to protect ourselves. Right now there is a $50 difference in prices on GDAX and Binance. Clear manipulation. 

Is anyone else willing to share any similar results or have you noticed? This was on Binance. 

Or you could just save your money and HODL. Either way, it's gonna be yuuuuge.",1525347459,03/05/2018 11:37:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gpp5q/apis_and_holding_ratios/,1

Is Bitcoin a hedge against fiat currencies?,"This was always what I understood as the basic premise for the value of investing in bitcoin. Governments and other bad actors couldn't come along and manipulate bitcoin like they do fiat currencies because of the decentralized anonymous mining thingee, yada, yada, etc. So as those bad actors fuck with the traditional economy and currencies, bitcoin will come to be viewed as a better store of value.

But I've notice that cryptocurrencies tend to covary quite nicely with dollar denominated asset prices. So if my bitcoins are going to tank when my other long investments in traditional assets are going to tank, what is the value of bitcoin?

I think her coworker said it wasn't a good investment at all, but I think it is. Especially because I only wanna invest like a 100 dollars, or maybe even less.

Bitcoin NDFs from Goldman - Why this is a very big deal,"Goldman's announcement that they will be introducing NDFs (Non-deliverable Forwards) for Bitcoin is a really big deal. This type of contract is how major emerging markets currencies are traded by banks and large institutional clients - no underlying currency is ever exchanged, the parties just settle up at the end of the contract in USD based on the price change. This is a big step in the legitimization of bitcoin as a real global currency, and allows for much easier hedging activity for players who want to get involved in the space.
Crucially, this is gigantic for Bitcoin as an actual use case currency, it allows major retailers who want to accept Bitcoin as a payment method to effectively hedge this exposure without all the hassle of physically transferring the Bitcoin as it is received. For example, Amazon could now manage Bitcoin transaction exposure the same way they would Indian Rupees. While businesses could hypothetically accept and manage the risk before, this opens up the possibility of them managing it in the exact same way they do their other EM ccy exposures, which is so much easier from an organizational perspective that is really changes the game.",1525383463,03/05/2018 21:37:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gu0m8/bitcoin_ndfs_from_goldman_why_this_is_a_very_big/,1

To be more specific, on the ""homepage"" of the app, there's a tab labeled ""banks"" -- when I click this, it says *""You can no longer buy and sell bitcoin with us. But you have options!""* -- and below, it gives these options:

(1) Convert to US dollars to cash out.

(2) Move your money to any bitcoin address.

(3) Hold your bitcoin with us (it's fully insured).

---

There's a ""convert currency"" button below option (1), but I'm almost certain that method is strictly to ""convert ALL currency"".

The only thing I can think to do is get a new bitcoin app &amp; send my bitcoin to that new app, then convert whatever portion I want to from there. But I would rather not do this, as it's a pain to set up one of those apps/accounts.

I first heard of bitcoin when it was around $5,"This was back around the middle of 2012.  Around the time Ron Paul was kicking butt.  Some libertarians (which Satoshi aka Nick Szabo and Hal Finney are) were talking about it as well as the usual gold and silver talk in a chat.  I thought it sounded like Farmville tokens or whatever.  I didn't do any research into it because the name also sounded video game-ish.  I thought, we have digital dollars, what's the point?  So, I never bought any.  Until last year when I kept hearing about it over the years.

This is how many people think of bitcoin.  They don't do actual research into it.  They think it's a fad.  They don't know it's an evolution of the monetary system.  They don't know there's a 21 million coin cap.  They don't know that it's uncensorable.  Etc.  Many people have not done proper research.  Many people just assume the governments and corporations of the world have already researched everything for them, discovered the cures for diseases first, come up with the greatest idea, etc.  They don't know that it is still early days.  They don't know they can be liberated from their monetary bondage.

Nobody in bitcoin told me these things back in 2011.  All I heard was that it was some alternative form of money.  And I thought, meh, it will never be adopted, the dollar is too entrenched in everybody's lives, there's no way everyone will switch.  

Sigh.

Now I know bitcoin is inevitably the world's reserve currency.  I only wish I had done proper research earlier.",1525395956,04/05/2018 01:05:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gvf9c/i_first_heard_of_bitcoin_when_it_was_around_5/,1

Among other things Banco stated: ""The only monetary and account unit in Colombia is the peso (bills and coins) issued by the Banco de la Republica. Bitcoin is not a currency in Colombia ... .""

Despite its relatively unobtrusive and, even, banal content this Communicado had evoked a long-lasting confusion in local as well as world's mass-medias concerning the legality of crypto-currencies in this South American country. The state of general bafflement about crypto in Colombia was exacerbated even further, when the Superintendencia de Sociedades - a relatively obscure department of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism - had stepped in this hotted dispute and delivered its own ""clarification"" of the Bitcoin ""issue"", dated at September 2017.

In their short but totally muddled two-pagers, which was, rather unhelpfully, named ""Illigal results of the business activity conducted under the multi-level scheme for the sale and placement of virtual currency"", local bureaucrats managed to utterly confuse themselves by desperately trying to draw the direct line between the subject of rising Bitcoin world-wide popularity and the proliferation of local ""investment clubs"", tagged as ""ponzi schemes"" in this memorandum, in Bogota.

As a result of those ill-informed efforts of local watchdogs to warn the public against non-existing threats, the issue of Bitcoin legality in Colombia has became even more fazed. Currently, after several additional more-or-less bedazzled statements have been made on crypto-themes by both Banco and Superintendencia, we, nonetheless, can conclude that Bitcoin is still legal in Colombia. However, this subject fully resides in a ""gray"" zone of local law and, taking into account totally non-friendly stance of Colombian financial regulators towards crypto (what is, of course, not so surprising), digital money issuance and usage in this country might be outlawed virtually overnight.

Why can't Bitcoin just work like simple private/public key chaining without mining?,"I'm not sure this is the right place to ask or if I'm articulating this the way I heard it, but someone asked me during a discussion why Bitcoin needs miners and can't just work on public/private key chaining \(I guess like git versioning, I'm not sure\), why it needs to be decentralized, and that it wasn't actually decentralized but was centralized because of some strange arguments that didn't make sense with what I'd heard/read myself and seemed to be a misunderstanding of the distribution of miners/ASICS/corporate farms around the world \(like Bitmain having 20&amp;#37;\+ at some point\)...

I'm honestly not sure I 100&amp;#37; understood his questions, as he's basically an SSL/TLS expert \(at least enough to show how it works, and I've also worked with it\), but I tried to explain what I understood about Bitcoin/blockchain mining in that the miners validate the transactions using the source code algorithms, and when 51&amp;#37; consensus is reached through that ""decryption"", a new validated ""transaction"" is added to the ""block"" and when enough transactions happen the block is finalized and added to the chain.

I'm probably getting a little wrong, but I just could not make sense of him saying it's actually centralized and there's no use for it nor miners and also that it's just overly\-complicated algorithms meant to make its creators feel powerful or something... I did ask however if he understood the Byzantine general problem or Merkle roots or round robin, and he said no. So I feel like he has a peach\-fuzz understanding of blockchain but I don't know that I understand it enough to explain it very well \(at least it wasn't to his satisfaction\).",1525407900,04/05/2018 04:25:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gwkoh/why_cant_bitcoin_just_work_like_simple/,1

Is a central authority like a government required to ensure a transaction receiver received their purchase?,"I know in the Bitcoin blockchain, receivership of Bitcoin \(in whatever amount\) is validated by the miners/cryptographic functions consensus, but that doesn't mean whatever was ""purchased"" by it \(like an apple\) can be validated to be received by the purchaser. I was speaking with someone today who mentioned that a central authority is required to insure that the purchaser receives the apple or receives a refund.

I honestly don't know how Bitcoin or any dApp \(smart transaction\) blockchain could validate that an apple or even any digital good was actually received by the ""purchaser"" \(or even mailed/emailed to them\), but it can record that at least an apple or digital good was bought. So the ""trust"" is then set on the receiver of the Bitcoin \(or whatever coin\) to provide the purchaser with the apple or digital good. I suppose if a digital string of characters is the purchased good, that could be in the purchaser's wallet and show that it was received, but I'm not sure that's something buyers would actually want \(for privacy reasons\).

I said that yes for physical items, no blockchain can prove an item was delivered \(like say if USPS put shipping transactions on a blockchain, they could state in the transaction what was delivered, where, when, from who, and maybe even record a delivery signature, but that doesn't mean it was actually physically delivered\), but that doesn't undermine the blockchain, as its trustless and the only trust that is expected or lost would be on the deliverer/sender of the apple. The record can't be changed, just a new record added correcting the previous record. He said blockchains aren't trustless, that we rely on the trust of the centralized nodes \(I guess he meant the master nodes?\), and that that's irrelevant anyways as they can't prove the apple was delivered.

So is he right that transactions using Bitcoin must rely on an outside centralized authority like Binance to ensure delivery of a purchased good? Or can blockchains be built in a way that at least ensures delivery of digital goods, even if they then would be publicly visible on the blockchain \(or at least visible only to the wallet private key holder\), or at least ensure a record of the delivery \(like a picture\)?

I don't think this argument invalidates the reason to have blockchain, but I certainly couldn't tell him it was better than any centralized authority he relies on, like the FDIC ensuring bank account \(ironically of course banks and the government are both centralized\).",1525413202,04/05/2018 05:53:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gx0s7/is_a_central_authority_like_a_government_required/,1

Profiling Bitcoin users with artificial intelligence : Our proof of concept,"Blockchain Inspector POC, has been released. You can access it through this link : https://medium.com/@bci_corporate/profiling-bitcoin-users-with-artificial-intelligence-our-proof-of-concept-33c3ad08884

Thanks to our own ten-year-old Artificial Intelligence engine, we allow you to profile bitcoin users. The key advantage of our solution is that it can easily translates human reasoning into rules and in so doing can transpose the experience of experts into a computer system capable of processing very large amounts of data.

The idea is to allow any human expert to transform its reasoning into automatic reasoning and allow him to specify the associated calculated uncertainty. The hypothesis made by the system could be vaque (“expensive”), inaccurate (“between x and y”), error prone (“x with 5% error”) and also specify that the validity is not completely true and completely false (‘90% of time”).

Goldman Sachs Announces Bitcoin is not a Fraud and Plans to Start up Bitcoin Trading,"According to a report in New York Times, Goldman Sachs has claimed that [Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-bitcoin/) is not a fraud and the company has launched plans concerning to Bitcoin trading.

The plan differentiates Goldman Sachs from its competitors on Wall Street. The company will first trade contracts related to Bitcoin’s risk exposure before starting up official [Bitcoin trading](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/). Bloomberg cites individuals briefed on the matter saying that Goldman plans to start a small-scale trading by supplying a finite number of derivatives.

When commenting on this decision, Rana Yared, an executive who participated in the creation of these products, mentioned Goldman Sachs had been bombarded by requests from customers about Bitcoin trading. Then the client’s statement that holding Bitcoin futures is an alternative to store value also brought resonance to her.

She added that it was stunning for Goldman Sachs to claim Bitcoin is not a fraud, for Jamie Dimon’s (the CEO of JPMorgan Chase&amp;Co.)notorious announcement about Bitcoin still lingering.

However, even the CEO of Goldman Sachs had asserted that he would not buy Bitcoin when [Bitcoin’s price ](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/) peaked in December, 2017. Then Yared also promptly cleared of rumors assuming Goldman Sachs to be a believer in Bitcoin.

In addition, Yared said “I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world. For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.”

Bitcoin is rising because of the new business of Goldman Sachs,"Bitcoin price rose to a two-month high on Thursday(American time), because the news that Goldman Sachs is promoting the business of [bitcoin trading](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-contributors-rising/) was released. Meanwhile, the newest report of Square mentioned that its income gaining from bitcoin token is $34 million.


[Bitcoin price](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/
) fluctuated by 6.2% on Thursday, and the trading price is between $9163 and $9713. The data nowadays is 51% lower than the highest price on 18 December, 2018. [Bitcoin value](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/
) has risen by 5.8% in the past week while declined by 33% since this year.


However, some details of the news may prevent investors from moving on. An insider revealed that Goldman Sachs is struggling for the long-term cryptocurrency trading, planing to start its small-scale transaction through offering a limited number of derivatives, which reminds people that many traditional financial institutions are supervised by the rules of regulators. 


Meanwhile, Square revealed the contribution of [bitcoin](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/
) to the financial situation, which is not as optimistic as the rise of bitcoin. Although $34.1 million of the income was from the [bitcoins](https://citicoins.com/bitcoin/
) selling to the users of Cash App, the company spent $33.9 million to buy bitcoins, which means the company earned only $200 thousands.


Nevertheless, some people think the enthusiasm of the company about digital currencies and blockchain technique as the progress of emerging industry.",1525425595,04/05/2018 09:19:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gxx9b/bitcoin_is_rising_because_of_the_new_business_of/,1

THANK YOU for feedback - BitStarted version 2!,"First, thank you guys again for the feedback on my first thread about the website. I took a lot of it into account and I just wanted to release v 0.2, with some small updates and better content. Everyone has been so helpful, and I hope there is continued feedback as I continue on the project Below I will outline my goals for this website, and I welcome any feedback/advice.

So, for those that don’t know, I started a website called BitStarted.org which basically is meant to be a starting point for someone who doesn’t know anything about Bitcoin or blockchain. I used to just tell people who asked me to go to Bitcoin(dot)com, but as you guys know, we can’t do that anymore… so I made this and I hope it becomes helpful as more and more people enter the bitcoin world.

On the website, if you go to the About page you will see an outline of my goals. But essentially, I would like to turn the website into a knowledge base that covers all the basics of Bitcoin from the technology aspect of it to the use in real life aspect.

Please check out the website and give me any feedback. If you think you can contribute in another way, please contact me as well!",1525432798,04/05/2018 11:19:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gygtv/thank_you_for_feedback_bitstarted_version_2/,1

Bitcoin in our Post Monetary Society (PMS),"Post monetary desires appear the driver behind some projects currently being built. Most of us would of experienced PMS in the different star trek franchises. Humanity with a value system based on self improvement, so enriching the whole. When humanity embraces this new world view, could Bitcoin be a part of this future. 

Or is Bitcoin just an attempted power grab. Re-organising society the same way as before, rather than the financiers pulling the strings, the financiers with computer nerd skills taking their place.

 Lambos for the selected few, while the rest of humanity can eat cake. 

The concept of PMS, could this be a greater threat to Bitcoin and Blockchain thinking, and propagate out in a similar path that Bitcoin took. 

The choice between a star trek type of society, verses the current induced shortage hoarding society, which path would you choose? ",1525434462,04/05/2018 11:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gym93/bitcoin_in_our_post_monetary_society_pms/,1

To me this is a huge problem with Bitcoin Adoption...,"To preface I'm not against Bitcoin or Blockchain, I'm just currently researching it and trying to understand. Something that seems quite hard to be honest as there are so many polarizing opinions out there.


But one of my biggest issues as I see it know is Bitcoin distribution. I will just link a video that explains my issue:


https://youtu.be/AABkJ55Zz3A?t=157


Now the question is basically:


About 70% of Bitcoins have already been mined (distributed). If there is going to be widespread adoption do you think the supply of new Bitcoins is going to be sufficient?


This is followed by a non-answer and the person asking question follows up with ""Would that make us the new 1%?""


Further the question is answered as such:
Yes, you might be the new 1%, but the fundamental reason is **because you took an enormous risk on an untested technology based on a vision you had, rather than because your grandfather killed more people than my grandfather. Which is how the 1% have their money today.**


My brain here just goes into massive **DERP** mode. Alert! Alert! Alert! How is this any better or different? Basically then the following generations you've come full circle and the only reason 'the 1%' are rich is because their grandfather made some ballsy investments.


Also as far as I understand it's believed that the Bitcoin creator, whoever that is, sits on roughly 1 million BTC. If Bitcoin was adopted over the entire world this person would basically own 1/21th of the world? Why would I want to put my wealth into a system like this?


Maybe this is not really a problem with Bitcoin adoption but rather a social problem that has to be solved in other ways. Thoughts?",1525436542,04/05/2018 12:22:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gytdo/to_me_this_is_a_huge_problem_with_bitcoin_adoption/,1

Let's spread the word to Kijiji.ca,"I live in Canada and kijiji is definitly the best classified site to use. I use it frequently but unfortunately, they don't have the means to search for crypto friendly sellers/buyers as craigslist do.

I recently contacted their customer support suggesting they add this feature and their site and they responded in a very positive way! Here's a translation of their answers (was originaly in french): ""It's an excellent suggestion. I can very well see the advantages for you and many other members of our community. I'll pass your suggestion to our developement team so they can analyze it and hopefully implement it.""

Afterwards, I tweeted their twitter account the same thing: https://twitter.com/TibidonQC/status/987297435843284992

Their answer: ""Never know what the future holds!""

I call upon you to help spread your love for crypto and motivate kijiji to add a way to show that sellers/buyers accept crypto!

You can reach them on Twitter on @Kijiji You can also contact them on their website https://help.kijiji.ca/helpdesk/contact-us/ as a General Suggestion/Feedback.

Steps to get Google Developer console account using only bitcoins and anonymously,"I was searching for 2 weeks in the whole internet for a method to get google developer console. But fortunately I found a solution in the end :)

Google requires VISA/Mastercard credit or debit card 💳 only as way of payment of $25.

Steps:
1- go to giftocard, a website where you can purchase a virtual prepaid mastercard without KYC.

2- sign up and order a virtual card with at least $26 in it.

3- it gonna cost about $40 (slightly more or less) in btc. Choose btc method and send using address shown, it should detect and redirect to confirmation page of order within a couple of minutes or so.

4- wait for max 24 hrs. (mine arrived in 9 hrs). 

5- an email arrives, shown your 16 numbers card, Pin, CCV, date, billing address. Use prepaida dot com website to show balance and statement of your card in real time

6- purchase google developer account and wait for payment processing (mine was 6 hrs). 

7- Done!

Proof: https://imgur.com/a/Rfjs4ql

Hopefully this will be helpful for who are looking to purchase the developer account (or any other thing) anonymously by btc and most importantly with no verification. ",1525441600,04/05/2018 13:46:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gzcwy/steps_to_get_google_developer_console_account/,1
"Investment firm looking to purchase 10,000 Bitcoin once a month, every month, for one year","On behalf of the firm that I represent, I am seeking a seller who is able to provide up to 10,000 bitcoin per month once a month for one year. This will be a fixed contract managed through an escrow service. The price to be paid per Bitcoin is to be settled based on market price averages based on the highest volume exchanges in USD/BTC at a set time and a set date each month. Due to the nature of this contract, and the high volatility of the price, we are willing to pay market price minus a percentage. We are willing to consider contracts as small as 1,000 bitcoin per month. All contracts will be for a duration of 1 year. 

If you are a private holder of Bitcoin in the quantities noted and have interest in this proposal please send me a private message to proceed.

CEX.io is SCAM!!!!," CEX.IO ARE FRAUDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. On 19 February I registered an account on the website of the cryptocurrency stock exchange CEX.io \( ID# up118741364\). 
2. On 21 February I bankwired US$5000,9  to my CEX.io\-account  and since then the operation is still “pending” \(for 74 days already!!!\).  
3. The support service answered to all my letters \(ticket 709424\) with common phrases «We will do our best to find the solution», «We kindly ask you to understand that it may take some time», but they didn't provide any proofs that they did anything regarding to my problem. As I see now a lot of people have the same issues with CEX \([https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2756135.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2756135.0) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/813qr0/cexio\_i\_cant\_let\_you\_steal\_my\_5500usd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/813qr0/cexio_i_cant_let_you_steal_my_5500usd/) etc\), so I suppose the company just stole my money.

The incredible intrinsic value of a perfect economic accounting ledger,"Let’s talk about intrinsic value and where a currency’s value comes from.  First let me say that I appreciate it when people talk about intrinsic value because it lets me know right away that they do not understand money.  The same is true for people who ask what a currency is “backed by”.

People who use the term intrinsic value seem to think all of humanity has fallen for a ruse and have been duped into incorrectly thinking pieces of paper have value.  Sometimes they draw an analogy to actual monopoly money and claim they are the exact same thing with the only difference being OTHER people (but never the person making this claim) have been duped.

The problem is that the market DOES place value on dollars and if your view of money does not align with the reality of how people and the market as a whole treat money then you should conclude your view of money is wrong rather than concluding everyone else on the planet has been tricked into irrational behavior.  

I think a more accurate analysis of value would be to break the value of an asset/currency up into non-monetary value (or utility) and monetary value.  Monetary value is a real thing and people assign monetary value to currency because it is in their individual interest to do so.  By participating in the sociological activity that money is, an individual gains tremendous advantages over someone who has no way of maintaining an accounting system with others. 

Let’s look at gold.  People who say gold has “non-monetary value” have no clue what they are talking about.  If you look at how most gold is used, the vast majority of people buy it and stick it in a vault and hoard it like some dragon from a J.R.R. Tolkien novel.  “But you can make jewelry out of it…” is nonsense because that’s not what we observe people doing with gold.  People hoard it in values and use it as an accounting ledger to store value, as such we can conclude that almost ALL of the value of gold is monetary value.  Gold is not value because it is shinny for whatever physical property people thinks give it value; gold is valuable because it can be used as a difficult-to-corrupt ledger of account for an economy, albeit very inefficiently.  This is mostly due to its supply constraints.

Similarly, fiat currencies being “backed by gold” are not more useful because they can be redeemed for gold in case you suddenly get an urge to cast a statue of Bhudda, but rather because the “backing” and counterparty risk that come along with that backing offer some measure of supply constraint to the fiat currency, although when the stakes get high enough, the currency’s central authorities have demonstrated they are willing to remove this constraint as doing so provides them with much benefit.  I suppose a fiat currency backed by bitcoin would be far superior to one that is not (although with Bitcoin’s properties this is not necessary).

Monetary value is ALL about the security and reliability of an accounting ledger.  All the value of gold, dollars, Euros, etc, is due to the value it offers as a giant imaginary spreadsheet for keeping track of economic exchanges between individual agents of an economy.  And they’re all very bad at it.  

Recently in 2009, a new ledger entered the marketplace unencumbered by all the inefficiencies of having to store gold bricks or having a central bank slipping themselves some extra ledger entries in their favor.  The value of that ledger has behaved exactly as you would expect if you understand money and what properties make a good ledger, and will continue to do so until people no longer use shitty ledgers of economic accounting in favor of one that is secure, immutable, permissionless, and inflation immune.    Once this has happened people will go back and backwards rationalize what they still don’t understand.  They will call Bitcoin investors “lucky”.  But it will only appear as luck to people who don’t understand what happened; the outcome was a known certainty to anyone with an understanding of monetary economics the moment the genesis block was mined.

Square &amp; Lightning,"Did anyone else notice this in the [latest update](https://blog.lightning.engineering/posts/2018/05/02/lightning-ux.html) from lightning labs 
&gt; “Using the Lightning-integrated point-of-sale system from Rectangle™”   
 
Given that [Jack Dorsey](https://www.forbes.com/profile/jack-dorsey/) (founder of Square) has [invested](https://qz.com/1228958/jack-dorsey-is-betting-that-bitcoin-still-has-a-future-as-digital-cash/)  in lightning labs I think it is basically a given that this will happen. This could kickstart Lightning adoption if merchants globally wake up one day in the coming years to a notification saying they can now accept ~0 fee Bitcoin Payments. Might be obvious to many but many might have missed this like I did on the first read!

But does the receiver know who the original sender is? Does Carol know the money she received from Bob channel is actually from Alice?",1525454182,04/05/2018 17:16:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8h0wvv/ln_question/,1

My Bitcoin success story,"I'm currently traveling through South America, where credit cards are rarely accepted (only by really high-end restaurants and hotels). I normally take cash out of the ATM and use that, but I screwed up and forgot to take my card back from the ATM so it got eaten. I called the ATM's bank and they said it would take 5 days to get the card back, but I was already on my way to a different country. My bank said they could mail a new ATM card but that would also take 5+ days. So I found myself stuck with about $25 to last me for 5 days, maybe even more.

I looked at my different options, Western Union and MoneyGram wanted to charge about $15, plus a 3% fee on conversion rate - PLUS a bank wire fee of $25 by my own bank! 

Then I had the idea to get on Coinmap, and lo and behold there's a cafe that accepts BTC. I stopped in for lunch and the owner asked me if I wanted to sell any Bitcoin. I was like hell yeah, that would be a lifesaver! He used a local exchange rate, which was worse than mine, so not only did I get a fresh stack of cash to hold me over for a week, I did everything completely ""off the grid"" and actually made a few percent instead of paying like $50 in fees.

It was my first cash sale of Bitcoin and it really showed me how useful and flexible having a decentralized currency can be. Anyways, just wanted to share my success story from today :] Cheers all",1525457383,04/05/2018 18:09:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8h1bjo/my_bitcoin_success_story/,1

Bitcoin Banknotes Now Available in Singapore,"These bitcoin banknotes were sold by Tangem company and are rather called“smart-banknotes”. They are not really made of paper; they are hardware storage units with a S3D350A chip manufactured by Samsung. What they have in common with banknotes is that they represent one set value and can be physically given as payment at an outlet. In essence, these notes are self-contained wallets with their own private key. Tangem refers to them as “uncopiable cold wallet[s]”.



According to a Tangem, the chip technology is tamper-proof, addressing “all known attack vectors on hardware and software levels.” It says that years of chip development via credit cards, SIM cards, and ID cards have led to a product secure enough that “cost of hacking a single banknote [is] uneconomical”.



The notes have an advantage over online transactions because payment is instant and does not incur a fee. The disadvantages to be fixed are security, distance, and convenience.



Banknotes are available for purchase now in denominations of 0.01 and 0.05 BTC

-------------------------------------------------------------

Roger Ver lies more often than he tells the truth. This is not an attack, just an objective observation of the facts.

""Mt. Gox is totally fine."" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0) ... shortly thereafter Mt. Gox implodes ... ""I am here to 'apologize'. Even though everything I said when I told you 'Mt. Gox is fine' was true, I am sorry that some of you lost money when it collapsed. Buy ether.""

""I am banned from posting in /r/Bitcoin"" ... accidentally posts to /r/Bitcoin ... ""Oops. Now I'll pretend like I never claimed to be banned from /r/Bitcoin, and ignore anyone who asks me about that claim.""

""I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC""... 2 weeks later: ""I haven't sold a single Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday""

He lies about the subreddit he controls. He regularly lies about his holdings. He lied and scammed his way into the bitcoin.com domain, which he uses to push out FUD about Bitcoin and its developers. He lies on agreements he signs (e.g. ""the bitcoin.com pool will mine with NYA/btc1/2x code... whoops just kidding, we're mining bcash instead""). He even had the audacity to lie about what happened in court, when there is a public transcript available which disproves everything he said.

There are more examples of blatant deception that I don't have the time or patience to dig up right now. Make no mistake: the man is, unfortunately, a sociopath.

"Thank you Bitcoin. If not for you, I wouldn't have been able to transition when I did. It may have literally saved my life.","In late 2016 the military announced that trans people could come out and serve.  So I did.  I had been thinking on it for years, accepting it about myself for years, and I remember that fateful morning walking into the counselor's office.  
 
After and endless barrage of mandatory questions about unrelated nonsense, she finally got to the point - ""*What's wrong?  Why are you here?*"" 
 
""I think.... No.. Not I think.""  I steeled myself, held the tears back, and took a deep breath.  ""I know I am transgender."" 
 
""Oh sweetie,"" she replied, her eyes getting big.  ""Is that the first time you've ever said that out loud to someone?"" 
 
I burst into tears for the next half hour.  It was finally done.  I had come out.  I felt simultaneously sick and in the greatest relief of my life. 
 
I went back several times over the coming weeks to speak with them, and after a month I was sure I wanted to start hrt immediately.  I had been waiting long enough, reading about it long enough, and I wrote in a private journal (back in Xmas 2015) that ""*there will be no 2017 for me without transition, I absolutely will begin by then*"". 
 
That's when the military informed me the process of gender transition was so new, they didn't even have procedures in place to assign hormone replacement therapy (hrt) yet.  In case you aren't aware, that's the process of stopping someone's (incorrect) birth sex hormones (in my case testosterone) and supplying the correct hormones (in my case estrogen and progesterone).  It creates a second puberty in the individual which brings both the brain and body into a state where the person's gender identity matches what they are experiencing biologically.  
  
""That's not going to be okay,"" I explained to them.  ""I have a diagnosis that gender transition is medically necessary, and you're telling me you don't know when I can actually have these *medically necessary* hormones?  And you have no idea at all what the timeline will be to get them?""  Let me assure you, it is a special hell to come out and finally accept that part of yourself... Only to be told you have to continue to suffer in the wrong sex hormones because a bloated bureaucracy can't get their act together.  
 
My work performance declined, I became despondent, and I explained day after day  to my gatekeepers that I needed to start hrt immediately.  Their reaction was either confusion or to treat me as if I was spoiled for expecting that I would be able to get a prescription in any sane amount of time. 
 
By the dawn of December I decided ""**f&amp;#$ them**"".  I had already spent months learning everything there was to know about trans endocrinology.  I was the one explaining to the doctors on base how the process of hormone replacement worked.  I knew far more than they likely ever would, including the precise doses I needed to slowly turn off my male hormones and replace them with female ones in a safe fashion.  2017 was coming, and there was no 2017 for me without transition.  
 
So with the help of the Reddit trans community (/r/transdiy 💕) I found an online pharmacy and a site that let's you order your own labs and blood work.  This online pharmacy was based out of Europe and had everything I needed... only problem was that the act of ordering your own medication had been deemed undesirable by the powers that be.  **The site that had the very thing I needed to go on living had been blocked by every major payment method... PayPal, Visa, banks, etc, etc.  All except one.  They took Bitcoin.** 
 
A few days into December my hands were shaking as I transferred the btc to them via BitPay and the order confirmed.  A week or so later they arrived: my first dose. 
 
12/12/2016 was day one of HRT for me.  I've been transitioning ever since.  The military was of course furious when they found out, but I was ferocious in my defense of what I had done.  I successfully argued that if the military refused to provide me with what I needed for the condition they themselves had diagnosed me with, then I had the right to take my health into my own hands.  Oh, and it was about 6 months later when they finally got their act together enough to refer me to an endocrinologist... who simply validated what I was already doing on my own.  I wouldn't have been able to sanely wait those 6 unnecessary months for hormones.  
 
I'm happier than I've ever been here in May of 2018.  Before my future seemed like a grey cloud of nothing, and now it's full of life, friendship, and possibilities.  I have the body I always expected and my brain runs on the right hormones instead of being poisoned daily by unwanted testosterone.  And I don't stress about the periods of time when I have to switch providers, or when I need to get a prescription unknotted between cities... Because I know bitcoin and the internet will always allow me to get the hormones I need to sustain myself. 
 
Gender dysphoria put me in a horrific secret prison my entire life, and it was Bitcoin that finally allowed me to escape it.  I'll never forget that, and I'll always be thankful.",1525491403,05/05/2018 03:36:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8h4y5q/thank_you_bitcoin_if_not_for_you_i_wouldnt_have/,1

Remember this (from a 2012 Mt. Gox trader),"In the near future, when the fiat debt bubble explodes, as people become aware of how money is created, as the dollar loses value and international markets tighten, we will begin to hear overwhelming criticism. They will blame Bitcoin for everything, therefore, stay strong and HODL. Bitcoin will move down and up, will return to 9500, 9100, 8500... but do not fear, they are just trying to destabilize us, banksters last bullet. Only weak hands will fall before the FUDs. We are living possibly one of the greatest changes in the history of humanity, to live this is better than watching any movie!

BTC Narrative,"This debate of BTC v BCH will likely have a negative impact to BTC if not resolved with a uniform approach by the entire community.  It’s like hearing mass swarms of people arguing over whether a red apple or a green apple is the “real apple”.  They are both apples.  Just like both BTC and BCH are based on the foundations of the bitcoin whitepaper (thanks satoshi for the paper by the way).  

The free market will decide, over time, which is the better product implementation.  

This debate is like hearing a tape recording on repeat of which one is real of the following comparisons:

Microsoft v Apple (an operating system)
Honda v Ford (a vehicle)
Beanie baby v cabbage patch kid (a doll)

The winner is going to be the one that changes the narrative to “we have a better product”, not “we are the real one”.  

Hint hint BTC 🙄

A good crypto-project can and must be done anonymously,"If you do a project in crypto-space and you reveal your identity and location, then you will become an easy target for Statist adversaries. Satoshi Nakomoto never revealed his location nor his identity. His Bitcoin project still came through perfectly fine.


If your project makes sense, early adopters will flock to it, regardless of who exactly is behind it.


Furthermore, your project will seduce the right kind of crowd, who are interested in its usefulness and formal correctness, and who truly understand what you are doing.


Keeping out the ignorant masses for as long as possible, is a good thing for any project.


That is also a good reason not to worry about making the project more user-friendly than strictly needed.


The fact that the wrong demographic does not understand how to use it, is in fact a good filter. It allows you, at a critical time, to work with the better-quality users first, and focus exclusively on their feedback. There is no need to listen to the masses of latecomers later on, who will simply be told to take it or leave it.",1525531998,05/05/2018 14:53:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8h7zpy/a_good_cryptoproject_can_and_must_be_done/,1

[Help]Having trouble sending bitcoin from Coinbase to Electrum (Unconfirmed on Electrum),"Hi, I am kind of a noob so bare with me please. Sent coins from Coinbase to electrum around 2 weeks ago and it says sent on coinbase but on electrum it is unconfirmed. The address on coinbase i sent it to is different than my current wallet address but im quite sure i copy and pasted the wallet address right, electrum just changes your wallet address after some time. I have tried to change the server on electrum and it goes from a refresh button and saying ""synchronizing..."" to a red dot and ""Not Connected"". 

I have to update Electrum to the most recent version as mine is 2.6.4 but I read I have to download over my files of electrum to update and am very scared I will not be able to recover my coins. I also am not 100% sure of my username but I know my password for electrum and cant find out how to get to a screen where it automatically pulls my username up and asks for a password as it would do that if I had any BTC in my wallet and tried to send some back to Coinbase but I have 0 BTC in my wallet...So VERY worried if updating it is the issue that I will lose all my coins.

So can someone tell me what the issue is and what I have to do to get back onto my wallet after downloading the new Electrum over my current Electrum? Thank you so much anyone who can help, its a lot of money and Im stressing so much.

TL;DR: Changing servers doest work to confirm, also dont know what to expect when updating electrum and dont want to lose all coins if I download over it ",1525535635,05/05/2018 15:53:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8h8dc1/helphaving_trouble_sending_bitcoin_from_coinbase/,1

"UPDATE: CNBC gave me $1,000 to start a business in 14 days, so I launched a crypto apparel line","In a strange, one-of-a-kind assignment, I was given $1,000 and told to launch a business -- any business. The only requirement was that it had to go live in two weeks and that all profits would be donated to charity.

After spending $500 to get the site up and running with the design feedback of a bunch of my friends in /r/Bitcoin - I'm stoked to say sales at https://cryptocrow.co/ just crossed the $2,000 mark in just two weeks. Not only that, but about 15% of orders were paid for in bitcoin, which gives me huge hope that other Shopify stores will follow my lead in accepting crypto as a form of payment. 

It took some sleepless nights, but every suggestion from the last thread got added to the store, so please keep throwing ideas out there if you got them! 

As a thank you to everyone who helped me out, I'm sharing the discount code that's equal to the discount I gave my coworkers. Please don't tell my boss or share it outside the subreddit :) Use ""RedditBitcoinFam"" at checkout for 15% Off.

Cold Storage issues,"Apologies in advance, I'm not sure which sub I should post this is but I'm really hoping someone could give me a few tips.

I'd really like to get my coins into cold storage and I've had nothing but obstacles so far.

The issue I'm having now is I would like to create a paper wallet from the bitaddress generator, but I don't exactly just have an extra computer or OS that will ""never access the internet""

One idea is to install Ubuntu and boot that from a USB drive, and then generate the key offline from Ubuntu, then print. I thought that that was a great idea, until I saw that Ubuntu will not actually load (loading bar gets to 4/5 then it just hangs). There are solutions for the Ubuntu problem, but apparently they involve messing with my bios and other settings, which seems complicated to me. And with my other computers I have don't have the option to boot into Ubuntu because one is a laptop that I apparently have to mess with some sort of other complicated settings in order be able to boot from a USB drive, and the other is a mac.

Then the other issue is, I finally got a nano ledger S directly from ledger. It has been locked up on the firmware update and I have never been able to use it. This problem is common and many people have solved it, but I have tried every solution numerous times even on three different computers and it still doesn't work. I've been speaking to support from ledger and am waiting for a reply.

Anyone have any solutions for my paper wallet issue? I really just wanted to boot from Ubuntu or another software that is never online and generate the wallet there. Either way everything has been super annoying and I've wanted to launch the computer through the wall lol.

It’s getting to the point that,"It’s getting to the point that I’m seriously considering unsubscribing from /r/bitcoin because I’m sick of hearing about Roger Ver, BCH &amp; bitcoin.com

Seriously every second post seems to be about what Roger is doing, how evil BCH is, how it’s all a giant scam.

I’m so sick of hearing about it it’s unbelievable, /r/bitcoin spends more time talking about Roger than /r/btc does.

I’m not a particular fan of BCH but one thing I will say is while this sub bitches and whinges about Roger 24/7 people from the /r/btc sub are actually out there pushing for adoption, recruiting merchants, advertising BCH.

This sub needs to move on from its obsession with Roger and BCH and how they’re both the devils spawn and get back to what it’s all about, being Bitcoin, p2p cash.

So I would say to all of you move on from this vileness and get back to focusing on increasing adoption, signing up merchants, put your favourite bitcoin shirt on and hit the streets, educate people.

These are the things that this sub used to talk about, I would love to return to those days.

Discuss Warren Buffett’s comments,"Curious on your guys’ opinions of him calling it “rat poison”. As someone who respected his initial views and opinions on BTC, it seems like he’s lost all of his valid points against it. I definitely saw his initial arguments being that people were just buying it because of price, but now he’s just sounding silly.... rat poison? 

It’s not even intelligent or speaking on why the tech would never work, arguing the side of how governments wouldn’t allow it, etc... it’s almost like the most renowned investor in the world is blindly criticizing an almost trillion dollar capped asset. It’s kind of amazing lol",1525550272,05/05/2018 19:57:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8h9z8t/discuss_warren_buffetts_comments/,1

[Opinions] Is bitcoins lack of privacy a problem that will harm mainstream adoption.,"First of all, Im not a bitcoin expert and this has been discussed before. There is also problems like lack of scalability (with real decentralized crypos and not ones with masternodes) and ease of use. Is the privacy problem the biggest one tho? 

Also, I'm not talking about illegal activities but rather ""mainstream usage"". Would people feel confortable to give out all their transactions and how much they own on an open blockchain. We are neither telling to everybody how much money we have on out bank account (even if some third parties can get it from the bank) nor our transaction history. And what about companies? In some cases, transparency is great but do companies really want to tell other companies how much money they earn. Isn't that something they want to keep for themselves? The lack of privacy may be what makes governments accept bitcoin tho.

I cannot give a solution but I feel like the focus has only been on transaction per second. We mostly have discussions about LN or sacriface decentralization for bigger blocksize. I just feel like this is a topic together with ease of use is topics that, at least I, hav'nt read that much about. And of course, if you don't know who ownes the wallet privacy is less of a problem.

Bitcoin Mining Incentive,"Bitcoin uses proof of work to secure its network. For miners to mine, their incentive of (coinbase + transaction fees) * (probability of mining block first) must be greater than the opportunity cost of their GPUs.

Its often argued that miners have vested interests in the network since they have high upfront costs of mining equipment + have holdings in bitcoin.

However, with the AI arms race, using GPUs for mining has increasing opportunity cost over time. This in conjunction with developing crypto futures markets, allowing miners to hedge their risk of bitcoin collapse, seems to be a recipe for bitcoin desertion.

Quick actions you can take to help save people from being victimized by the fraud and impersonation tactics being used by Bitcoin.com.,"
# Background
The owner of Bitcoin.com is a well-known scammer and is using the ""Bitcoin"" name to trick people into getting wallet software that is for a coin that is not Bitcoin. **People who use these wallets and send funds to a Bitcoin address lose their funds**.



* Example [""Bitcoin Paper Wallet Generator""](https://tools.bitcoin.com/paper-wallet/) that does not generate a Bitcoin wallet. The wallet generated by this software is for a coin that is not Bitcoin.
* [Roundup of many lies and scams of Roger Ver](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8h4dit/roger_ver_is_a_wellknown_scammer/) by /u/ayanamirs. 
* Example of a recent Bitcoin.com scam: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbflM7aVMAAJE3_.jpg:large
* More details:  https://walletinvestor.com/magazine/lawsuit-is-being-organized-versus-bitcoin-com-for-misleading-novice-bitcoin-users/ 


# Actions

1. **Report** Bitcoin.com wallet page to [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/?hl=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwallet.bitcoin.com) so that the Chrome browser displays a warning page when people visit the page and download a wallet that they are mislead into thinking is for Bitcoin, but that attempts to trick the user into using a wallet for a coin that is not Bitcoin.

2. **Tweet** a message to [@JapanGov](https://twitter.com/JapanGova) and inform the Japanese government that the owner of Bitcoin.com, who is a resident that they took into their country and who [is a convicted felon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ver#Explosives) in the USA, is running a global scamming operation from within their country, using the website Bitcoin.com.

3. **Email** contact@serioustubes.network, the hosting provider for Bitcoin.com. Serious Tubes are an excellent provider and big supporters of cryptocurrency. They will not like being hosts for a site that is scamming users who want to use Bitcoin. 

4. [**Report** the Bitcoin.com Android Wallet App to Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2853570). This app labels itself as Bitcoin but lures users into using a wallet that is not for Bitcoin, and people who use it to send coins to a Bitcoin address will lose their coins. The fradulent app is here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoin.mwallet

5. [**Report** the Bitcoin.com iOS Wallet App to the Apple app store](http://reportaproblem.apple.com) for fraud. This app labels itself as Bitcoin but lures users into using a wallet that is not for Bitcoin, and people who use it to send coins to a Bitcoin address will lose their coins. The fraudulent app is here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-wallet-by-bitcoin-com/id1252903728

6. [**Contact** Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/request/) and ask them to remove from their Bitcoin page their ""Message Board 2"" link that links to the scam forum on Bitcoin.com. This forum attempts to fool people who want a Bitcoin forum into participating in a forum that promotes a coin that is not Bitcoin.


Please add in the comments section additional information and preventative actions on scams coming from Bitcoin.com and Roger Ver.


Thanks to /u/ayanamirs and /u/ivoisaev and others for documenting these Bitcoin.com scams.

Bcash is a scam,"Since Bitcoin created 0-conf it can do 0-conf transactions. So can Litecoin. LTC also has 2.5 minute block times instead of 10 minutes like Bcash. Litecoin’s programming is superior to BCash’s when it comes to flaws, or bugs if you will making security stronger. Litecoin confirms far quicker than Bcash ever will it seems and they’re both fully capable of 0-conf transactions. I spoke to Charlie Lee about this and have proof, so do not argue about LTC and 0-conf. Bcash can increase its block sizes forever to fit more transactions in each block, but the block time is still 10 minutes!?!?!?! Zero difference for the individual user if the blocks expand massively. Moore’s law doesn’t say GBs of data from your phone should be running Bcash nodes so it’s obviously got to be far more centralized from certain types of locations where nodes will be ran. 1-4mb blocks sounds a lot smarter once you realize that Bcash will be joining the LN and/or taking 2nd layer solutions eventually as well and core devs at Bcash have admitted this. Conserving the base layer isn’t advancing and cryptocurrency is for humanity long term way beyond anyone reading this lifetime. 100+ years from now when we’re on so many layered solutions with a fully built up and always advancing internet of value (the LN) you’ll want 1-4mb blocks because any device anywhere (even off of earth as we expand into space) will be able to handle 1-4mb blocks. Quantum will allow the LN layers to become even better, all the incentives for everyone to use crypto will be with the LN, and there will more than likely be a secure  LN wallet directly connected to the LN which would be the main wallet used by everyone on Earth.... All other wallets would most likely just be capable of being Lightning enabled. Bcash is essentially a giant Bitcoin testnet considering anything Bcash does creates “impiricle evidence” for BTC to see if it works if it chooses to implement any of it later. Bcash promotes the concept  “use it right now don’t wait for BTC get it now use it today get your shirts and give aways check out the new Bcash cars trucks try to win one get free Bcash etc”. And   this currency wants to take over the global reserve currency in the works and sustainable long term digital gold standard. Give me a break. Bcash has some cool ideas being brought forth, agreed, but this is simply just a project. As are many cryptos. Bitcoin could just steal it all if it wanted to implement any of the stuff anyone has developed in the space. Bcash boasts about “impiricle evidence” yet they’re about to implement all sorts of stuff that has never been done or tested before to attempt at advancing Bcash. This development has zero “impiricle evidence” anything could work, let alone long term, as it’s stated on bitcoincash.org and is far too much of a gamble and chopshop in concept for Earth’s global currency in the creation to take. If you are a firm believer in Bcash and think Bitcoin is being taken over than good luck I hope you the best, but chances are you’ve never spoken to the smartest people in the space or understand how to analyze the code. How about that extremely insecure Bitcoin(dot)com tons of bugs in the code with sloppy test sites set live that started off as a Wix website. If Bcash supporters have anything knowledgeable to say to argue against this post that isn’t just Roger Ver and crew’s hype (a felon who got lucky on finding BTC early with the rest of the scam team and fake-Satoshi) then please inform all of Reddit. Don’t even start the r/Bitcoin means censorship argument because Bcash constantly heavily attacks any post trying to market for Bcash on every single subreddit that isn’t (are)Bitcoin. I also got blocked on Twitter by @Bitcoin, which is a Bcash owner of the Twitter account, because I spoke for BTC instead of Bcash. I have proof @Bitcoin blocked me as well if you argue that case. How @Bitcoin (which is Bcash; not Bitcoin, which is very misleading just like Bitcoin(dot)com and every subreddit marker is) blocked me is beyond me because last time I checked lies were being spread that Bcash isn’t censorship resistant. Apparently censorship is heavy with the Bcash community.... go figure. Maybe people who were conned into Bcash “use it now it’s free” concept will wake up after reading this post and realize “use it now it’s free” has been one of, if not, the largest scam concepts in history.

How I got scammed for 3 BTC,"I'm usually the guy who get asked how to avoid scam and what is safe and what is not, this time I went fully retard and trusted the wrong people

My story begins on paxful.com where I wanted to trade bitcoin for MoneyGram, I talked to this seller named Quincy and he delivered and seemed legit

He gave me his whatsapp number incase he wasn't on the site, I went ahead and talked to him as I needed more services

I was sending him to mall's to buy me Amazon gift cards sometimes visa gift cards as they are not available in my country and also our Central Bank shut down credit card payment options for all banks ( talk about the need to decentralization )

we were doing good business, we even did a bank deposits once for 5k, I thought I had an honest man

While we were talking he told me about this lady that buys the bitcoin from him and how rich she is as she used to work for Google

After a month or so he said the lady wants big amounts of BTC and I will connect you directly to her just promise to keep our normal gift card businesses going, and I agreed for sure

I talked to the lady her name is Kimberley Tew, a mother of twins, married to Michael A Tew who works as Chief Financial Officer at National Air Cargo Holdings, Inc

I had all information about them and thought I could trust her since Quincy says he knows her and can be trusted

She told me about how she trades bitcoin and gave profit back ( I should have known that this is a classic scam trick ) but I was stupid and blind

I refused to lend her anything at the start and did a bank deposit for 7k and she delivered 

We had good talk then one day she kept sending me messages and she need btc badly, I thought why not

I told her I'm just helping you not interested in profit and sent her what I was holding for the long run, alt coins worth 3 BTC ( 35 k ) at the time

When the time came she didn't give anything back and said she lost it all and her husband is refusing to let her buy any more crypto

She asked for to wait for another month and she didn't deliver, and did the same thing one more time

And now she doesn't answer back nor does Quincy who was spouse to ship me an item I bought.

So I guess I was a fool and there is no women at the first place this guy played me all along

I don't know what to do at this point, I had plans for these coins and I'm from the middle east it's not like anyone from USA government would ever listen

I have phone numbers and address's if someone can help and will be rewarded.

And that's my story, I learnt the lesson the hard way, TRSUT NO ONE.

Lightning LAPPS vs Bcash DAPPs,"Hey all,

I saw recently that there are quite a few LAPPS (Lightning DAPPS) that are being built for future use. This is very exciting!

As a still learning fellow how do LAPPs compare to Bcash dapps such as Memo and (their coming attempt) at colored coins. 

When it comes to programming languages, possible implementations...etc. I am hoping to get some high level over view in the differences, LAPPS seem like a freight train coming that nobody knows about and I want to learn a little more.

"If stock markets crash, will real estate and bitcoin follow?","I’m of the opinion that both real estate and bitcoin will not fall in price if stock markets crash.

I say this because the situation now is different from the sub prime bubble.

I believe real estate will be just as valuable (at least in dense populated cities) since demand will not decrease - people still gotta find a place to live. In fact, I believe the stock market crash will further increase the gap between the rich and the poor because real estate prices will not decrease, while the people still holding onto stocks lose their savings.

Bitcoin won’t drop either, self explanatory since I believe all of us in this subreddit are bullish on BTC...

Some basic questions about blocksize...,"Hi,

Sorry if these questions are basic but...

1. If each block is 1Mb and one block is processed every 10 minutes, does this mean that running a node requires a bandwidth of at least 1Mb/10min, so roughly 2Kbps?

I understand the gist of the linear/exponential arguments against increasing blocksize, and that it can never be an ultimate  solution to an increasing userbase. And I think the argument for keeping a small blocksize is so that ANYONE can run a node, so...

2. Is the reason for keeping a low blocksize so that nodes can be run with a potentially very low bandwidth ?

I'm reading that some of the slowest internet (both mobile and fixed) connections in the world are around 3Mbps, roughly 1000x that required with the current blocksize (assuming all my assumptions above make sense). Now, perhaps someone is wanting to run a node through multiple VPNs, rerouted through a mobile phone buried in a desert via a satellite phone (just Googled this and satellite bandwidth does actually appear to be around 2Kbps), massively reducing their bandwitdth so...

3. Is this the point? That we could increase the blocksize perhaps tenfold or hundredfold without hindering any nodes, but at some point we're going to start limiting people wanting to run nodes with seriously low bandwidth, which reduces decentralisation and goes against the founding principles of BTC? So lets not increase blocksize and come up with other solutions?

4. Does anyone have any real examples of very low bandwidth nodes? Or of the potential to set them up if required (e.g. via satellite phone)?

I have no idea whether any of what I've posted is correct so any related information would be appreciated.

But thats getting ahead of myself. What I want to know is can coinbase reverse these transfers? (some were from bank accounts, some to gdax) What should I do right now? I already contacted them and had it escalated to their fraud department.  I am in a pretty confused and scared state as I lost alot of money here. Thank you in advance for the help!",1525617034,06/05/2018 14:30:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hfj8n/obtained_a_virus_all_currency_was_transferred_out/,1

A quote from Silicon Valley,"Jared: Are you aware of the Great London Horse Manure Crisis of 1894?
Emily Chang: I'm afraid I'm not.
Jared: In the 1890s, the Industrial Revolution had people flocking to the city, and more people equals more horses, and more horses equals more manure. And it was predicted that by the middle of the next century, there would be nine feet of manure covering the streets. But what no one saw coming, was a new technology that would completely obliterate those concerns. The car. Over night, the manure problem vanished. And the **global state of money**, as we currently know it, is rife with, uh, **theft, fraud, inflation, corrupt governments and banks**, and hacking. So, it's manure, and we believe that, in success, ** our new, entirely de-centralized ** currency, i.e. cryptocurrency**,  will be just as significant as the car.",1525619700,06/05/2018 15:15:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hftnv/a_quote_from_silicon_valley/,1

"Whats the most BTC you have ever ""lost"" whether from a hack, locking yourself out of wallet, throwing out a hard drive, etc.","Hey guys, I am curious to know if their is anyone in the crypto world that has taken more hits than me lol.

I once lost over a 1/4 million Canadian dollars in BTC as I had the external wallet (safest place for all that coin of course) in a fucking storage until which was broken into and everything stolen AND I ACCIDENTALLY THREW OUT THE 24 WORD MEMORIC TO RESTORE MY TREZOR WALLET TO ANOTHER.

Was depressed for a year and a half over that. That was when BTC was not even 500usd....then, it goes over a grand, then 2, then as you know it takes the fuck off. If my fucking storage unit wasn't robbed I'd have 10's of millions right now.

There was also a time, after the Mt.Gox BS causing that crash, were BTC stayed between 200-400usd for over 3 years. It was boring as fuck and most of my coins I had aquired for under 5 bucks Canadian. As soon as they were slightly over 400usd I cashed out 200 of them for 80k. I was SO happy at the time...

at one point this year that was 5 million dollars in Canadian currency...

I have learned to not dwell on shit like this. If we could tell the future, we'd all be rich. That year and a half I spent lying on the couch depressed about losing all my BTC was THE YEAR OF CRYPTO. I could have dumped 1k into any good coin at the start of 2017 and made MORE than all my money back

Being depressed about money is pointless. its a renewable resource but oh I know it hurts so bad to loose.

A lot of courses seem to have good content, but not many seem to have good visuals showing exactly how everything works, which is what i've tried to improve on.

I make you all filthy rich with crypto - no trading experience required,"Apologies for the long read but I'm trying to make a sound case

A preface:

Cryptocurrency is a collection of micro pyramid schemes contained within one overarching pyramid scheme. We only buy them in the hopes that there will be a bigger sucker who will pay more. Some of these technologies may prove integral in the coming years, but their current valuations are entirely speculative and hyperinflated.

All of you missed (or sold/lost) bitcoin. Most of you missed Ethereum. You can try to gamble on the next big shitcoin. I can even recommend a few. But what I offer to you is much less speculative. You don't need chart reading ability, nor is your wealth wholly at the mercy of an irrational markets. You get what you put into this.

Most of you are familiar with coinbase. Surely some have ventured into bittrex, binance, and poloniex.

Binance exchange is only 5 months old. And it has already become the rank 2 exchange for volume. They handle 2-3 billion dollars of trades everyday. Why? They have amazing customer support, great token selection, a mildly profitable referral system, and the BNB token. It is their proprietary token. BNB token cuts trading fees in half. None of the other archaic exchanges have any features like this, hence why they are falling behind.

Enter Binance 2.0 - KuCoin Exchange. Chinese based exchange that was just created one month ago. Superior to Binance in all facets. Great customer service, bank-tier encryption (high security), good UI, and an even better referral program.

ONLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS POST:

If someone uses your referral link when they sign up to KuCoin, you will receive 20% of their trading fees. This extends to 3 degrees of separation. Meaning if they refer someone, you will also incur a small portion of that person's fees. Repeat once more.

Why would someone use some chink exchange called KuCoin? It is going to rival Binance in the very near future. Much of Binance's popularity comes from their BNB token. KuCoin has a much better version of the BNB token. Anyone who holds KuCoinShares (KCS Token) will receive dividends of the exchange's trading fees.

90% of KuCoin's trading fees go to customers. 50% to KCS holders and the rest to referrals. Right now KuCoin exchange only handles 30m in daily volume. Binance went from 30m to 3b in just several months. And KuCoin is better in every way.

If you hold 10,000 dollars worth of KCS you will receive 100 dollars per day in dividends if the exchange reaches Binance levels of trading volume. Not to mention, the value of KCS is expected to rise exponentially as the exchange grows.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1R576

It means you sign up on KuCoin and start peddling this exchange to crypto noobs. Give them your referral link. This is your opportunity to get in on the ground floor of an MLM pyramid scheme. It will not collapse because this will soon be one of the best exchanges. Daily volume is rapidly increasing.

Even people who are relatively well versed in crypto are unaware of KuCoin exchange. When you signup I highly recommend buying some KCS so you can begin receiving dividends.

https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1R576

I know people who are making $1500+ per week off referrals. As Kucoin overtakes Binance and Bittrek, I forsee quadruple digits earnings. This is a great opportunity in my view",1525626129,06/05/2018 17:02:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hgk9f/i_make_you_all_filthy_rich_with_crypto_no_trading/,1

Mining as a Solution to Replace Online Advertisements,"Sites that have paywalls have been around for a while. But companies found that users are by-and-large unwilling to pay for services on the internet. This is why we got the advertising giants like Google, Facebook, etc. However, there are good reasons to try and figure out a way to get rid of this model. Users don’t like seeing ads, and there are significant privacy implications. 

I wonder if it would be possible to replace this model with one where users mine a small amount of some cryptocurrency while they are on the site. Alternatively, they could pay to use the site. Hearing their CPU run at 100% may deter people from using the service, so maybe have it go at 20%. Or periodically mine while they view the site. The implementation of this might be as simple as the website delivering some kind of script to the user that sends back to the server hashes below a certain threshold, as a proof of work.

I don’t know how the numbers would work out. It would be interesting to see if a company could manage to make a similar amount of money with this system. I’m confident it could work from a user’s perspective. ",1525627548,06/05/2018 17:25:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hgqbu/mining_as_a_solution_to_replace_online/,1

Reasons to doubt Bitcoin Cash,"* While at times BCH does see very sharp price increases at times, typically it trends down.
* On average, volume is very low. A few weeks ago (before this current run-up) volume was only $300M per day, compared to BTC at &gt;$6B. This volume was even lower than coins valued at a lower market cap.
* It's sticking to old technology for a scaling solution, all for lower prices in the short term.
* BCH had to be forked off because the super majority of users and investment voted against bigger blocks. Why would sentiment change any different?
* Provided any given person did NOT like the direction BTC is going, why not invest in another coin with more additional features (ex: privacy, no fees, platform-related coins with finite amount like ETH)?
* It's much more centralized than BTC in nodes and leadership, and long-term it may not improve.
* Lastly, the name sounds flipping stupid and sounds like a scam...in a space noted for its scams.

Turns out it's now worth about 34€, that's nice. I had to move the money somewhere else becase ChangeTip is no longer in service, so I opened a Coinbase account where I transfered the BTC. I thought Coinbase would allow me to sell my BTC and get the money on PayPal, but looks like they don't work with PayPal anymore, and I'm not willing to involve my bank account.

Question From a Newbie,"So I am a newbie looking for the best coins, miners, and wallets out there and I was doing a little research today looking for a way to make a wallet. After making accounts on www.torlitecoin.com and www.coinbase.com I read some pretty terrible reviews about using these as wallets. I went to delete my account and torlitecoin does not have the option to. I stopped the account creation process for coinbase at the point where they asked for the last 4 digits of my ssn, and there is no way to get to any other part of the site without completing that step. My question is, Is it safe to just leave these accounts hanging around out there or do I need to find a way to shut them down? If I am in the wrong sub for this I apologize. Let me know I will look harder for the correct sub or you can point me in the right direction.

Bittrex engineer's opinion of Freewallet,"I'm a site engineer for Bittrex, which is the highest security crypto exchange in existence, for those who may be unaware. I'm HIGHLY disturbed by the posts Ive seen regarding the mobile app Freewallet, including the apparent scamming of an individual suffering a severe medical condition. I can tell you that there is no excuse for the apparent methods of u/freewallet_support, and that is solely based on their own words. Speaking without bias, it is entirely clear to me that Freewallet is indeed a scam. I've never seen such a plethora of scam complaints against a company that insists it's legitimate. I'll be using my reach via the Bittrex platform and our partners to expose their scam to the best of my ability, unless they can show that these complaints are resolved.

They purport to be a ""wallet"", yet they act as a custodian. Those are two entirely different things. A custodian can prevent the rightful owner of the crypto to control the fate of their holdings. Right there you can see the underpinnings of what appears to be Freewallet's scam. To everyone who's been scammed by them, or believes that to be the case, please describe for me your precise issue, along with their Aml-Kyc procedure and what ID documents they had you provide. Also, how long ago did you provide those documents? In addition to pursuing them and their app hosts legally (i.e Google and Apple), which I certainly would recommend, I will attempt to assist you from other angles",1525662832,07/05/2018 03:13:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hkip7/bittrex_engineers_opinion_of_freewallet/,1

how to accept bitcoin w/o 3rd party?,"hey, just wondering how this is done.  I would like to start accepting bitcoin as I have some of my own.

I would love to do this without any 3rd party though, for online purchases I already use paypal which to their credit has been alright for me.  However, they have some pretty steep fees.  Also, by the time I can actually buy some bitcoin there's the exchange process + fees there etc etc.

Currently, it would work perfectly if its possible to easily attach an email address to the payment.  Problem is, of the wallets I've used, I've only seen ""address label"" as the only other parameter, and sometimes destination tag.

Is this viable? Or should I just go ahead and use bitpay or another 3rd party?

Ver situation,"Hello, I am Mr. Ver's persanal therapist and I'd like to ask you as a medical proffesional to talk more about my client. My equipment has detected elevated endorphin levels in his bloodstream and undulatory motions of his gluteus maximus correlating with him reading posts about his humble self on Reddit, which is characteristic of happiness. Needless to say, Mr. Ver has been feeling down lately (since January, to be precise), so this endorphin boost is something he sorely needs to alleviate the depression.

So I'd like to ask you to make more posts about my client, especially good-natured and congratulatory ones. Failure to do so will be counted as attempted personal injury and thus reported to the Internet police **and** the state police. Consequences will never be the same.

With respect,

"Users being triggered by the name ""Bitcoin core""","I don't get it. I post in a thread differentiating ""Bitcoin core"" from a fork which I won't mention from a scam artist I won't mention, and users get triggered - almost as triggered as the scam artist does in some youtube videos when he doesn't get his way.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The thing is, if you reference the pages on wikipedia and the official bitcoin github, it is clearly labeled as ""bitcoin core"". I wasn't trying to trigger anyone but it appears that using that terminology set off a storm of ignorance, downvotes, and posts, even with an /r/bitcoin moderator coming in to argue against the term ""bitcoin core"" saying that I should learn new terminology. Unfortunately that ignorance is on display from a few people, including a mod on this sub.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Does the term ""bitcoin core"" offend you?  
If so, how about petitioning it to have it removed from:  
* bitcoin.org - https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/   
* github - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin ""GitHub - bitcoin/bitcoin: Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree""  
* wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Core    

I'll be honest with you, I'd rather put my trust in those who have built bitcoin to be what it is , and if they call their nodes bitcoin core, then that's what I'd have to say it is. Someone even said ""bitcoin core"" is just the software that connects to the bitcoin network. Incorrect. Bitcoin core is also the software running on the nodes that sustain the bitcoin network. It's also the software that the pool operators often run (unless they have custom implementation) for sustaining the network hashrate.   
It just strikes me as odd how quickly people want to get offended and blurt out their opinions when they are clearly further out of touch from the atmosphere than I am, and I'll admit that I'm out of touch compared to many years ago; but this one is common sense.

Then he did a bit of TA suggesting bitcoin will continue to rise after breaking above a short-term trendline.

Bitcoin solves this problem for money, in that, it has the capacity to become a stable currency independent of central banks.

Campaign to Commission BTC Murals Across South America,"A few weeks ago I added the following comment to a thread about how to advertise Bitcoin and received a lot of upvotes and positive feedback so I thought I would see if we could make this idea into a reality. “I’m currently traveling South America photographing street art and have made some good contacts. With a budget and a few good designs we could put a mural in every major South American city.” Thread: [Can we start a coordinated global campaign to hire public billboards and advertise Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dlzuy/can_we_start_a_coordinated_global_campaign_to/) &lt;Enter&gt;
&lt;Enter&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;

&lt;Enter&gt;  
So I’m looking for:  &lt;Enter&gt;
&lt;Enter&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;

&lt;Enter&gt;  
A) Upvotes and support for this thread if you think it’s a good idea. If this gets enough attention there should be a budget available for the first project, so right now all I am asking for is help getting this thread some visibility. The first mural would be commissioned in Buenos Aires and if all goes well we could start a wider campaign and open things up for donations.  &lt;Enter&gt;
&lt;Enter&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;

&lt;Enter&gt;  
B) Some good concept art—clever enough to capture people’s imaginations, with just enough flair to get their attention first (selected designs compensated as part of budget + obvious street cred and bragging rights:)  Estimated cost of commissioning the mural would be $25 - $50/ square foot and it would be in conjunction with a number of smaller stencil designs placed around the city.  &lt;Enter&gt;
&lt;Enter&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;

&lt;Enter&gt;  
C) As I don’t always have the best internet access while traveling, possibly a person or two to help post and moderate follow-up threads. For example an official thread for design submissions, etc…   &lt;Enter&gt;
&lt;Enter&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;

"Charlie Munger (Warren Buffet's VP) said ""There's a lot of ignorance in the older generation that needs removal."" 6 hours and 40 minutes in to their 2018 Annual Shareholder Meeting","By now you probably heard the controversial comments about cryptocurrency made by Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. I'm very surprised no one pointed out that around 6 hours and 35 minutes or so the question of Google, Amazon, Apple comes up and Warren admits he messed up not buying Google and ""got it wrong"", he now understands Apple, and he still thinks Amazon Web Services is a miracle.

They further their point by saying they brought on younger eyes to help cure their age stupidity and it was most highlighted by the fact that Charlie ended the segment with the quote:

""There's a lot of ignorance in the older generation that needs removal.""

Circle invest or cash app?,"So I've had some bitcoin for a little bit. Nothing big or anything, just a little money I've thrown into it here and there. I used to use circle before it screwed everyone and stopped the crypto trade, but I noticed it's back as circle invest. I was using coinbase but that is an absolute nightmare that I don't want to get into at the moment. I've heard good things about the cash app. Seems reputable considering it's owned by square. Does anyone know which is better? I think circle invest takes a portion each transaction but I doubt the cash app isn't the same. Let me know your opinions.

Academic research regarding Bitcoin adoption in regulated markets.,"Hello r/Bitcoin!

I am a fourth year Management and Business analysis student in ISM University of Management and Economics. Currently I am writing bachelor thesis about awareness, adoption level and main barriers that CryptoCurrencies are facing to penetrate government regulated markets, such as Forex, Online Gambling among others.

I would like to invite representatives form regulated companies to a discussion that would greatly benefit my thesis. We can have a short 15-30 minutes discussion in form structured interview over Skype, phone or any other communication platform you prefer.

My schedule is very flexible for the next few weeks, please let me know if you would be interested to take part in it. Your input would be greatly appreciated.",1525758408,08/05/2018 05:46:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hue2u/academic_research_regarding_bitcoin_adoption_in/,1

"An open question to Buffett, Munger &amp; Gates regarding Bitcoin:","Who is going to pay our accumulated national debts?  You? The system which enabled your wealth creation? No. It will be left to your grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  I have no problem with any of you.  I have read about each of you and admire what you have accomplished.  (I was a business nerd who read financial statements for fun when I was growing up.  Example:  Warren's explanations of insurance float are golden (intended) and greatly impacted how I personally view capital deployment.)   Berkshire's annual letters should be mandatory reading for every aspiring business person.  But...  What strikes me as funny, no, shocking, is that you cannot even conceive of a world outside of the current financial system.  This is not a concept I embrace or endorse.  I believe what is forthcoming is going to hurt a great many people whom I love in a multitude of ways. Gentlemen.  Financial systems have failed before.  Obviously, none of you are stupid which could lead one to believe this is a conspiracy to protect our (your?) current way of life - but we know this not to be true.  Conspiracies are long on tin and short on reality.  You. Simply. Don't.  Get. It.  I can see it in your eyes.  I can hear it in your voice.  Do you believe we can kick the can down the road forever? What is going to happen when the people finally lose confidence in our ability to repay these staggering debt burdens?  So, to my question:  How much worldwide debt is too much?  $200T? (Oops, passed this milestone...) $300T? $500T?  $800T?  We no longer even hear a discussion about solving this problem.  All the talk centers on ""how much"" debt we will add to the tally this year.  Even fiscal convervatives never broach the subject of principal repayment because it is such a mind-bogglingly impossible task it's not even worth discussing.  But I know the 3 of you read voraciously and every reader occasionally indulges in historical works.  You know what is coming.  Discussions of ""intrinsic value"" for or against a particular currency are silly. Currencies are simply a matter of confidence.  Nothing more. Nothing less. Why has the Bolivar collapsed? Because no one believes.  What I don't believe? That the current system in America (or Japan, Europe, China, etc.) will change.  There are simply too many pigs at the trough.  Could I be wrong about cryptocurrencies?  Absolutely.  The current coins in existence could die tomorrow but I've picked my poison and I am comfortable with this outcome.  I no longer believe in the system you cannot fathom living without. What do I believe?  Math eventually wins.  Always.

Bitcoin payment gateway - 2 sided marketplace - dev question,"Hi, 

I'm urgently looking for advice on the best way to get a 2 sided bitcoin payment gateway implemented into my class project which is due in 48 hours.

I had set it up to work with https://www.klukt.com/ which was on the btc testnet, was free to use and would process payments with a widget and it all worked perfectly until this morning, used the extended public wallets and gave a qr code to purchase the item with etc.

I think something has happened to the website? I'm not sure and I can't reach the site admin.

I'm using Ruby on Rails for it.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Campaign to Commission BTC Murals Across South America,"A few weeks ago I added the following comment to a thread about how to advertise Bitcoin and received a lot of upvotes and positive feedback so I thought I would see if we could make this idea into a reality. “I’m currently traveling South America photographing street art and have made some good contacts. With a budget and a few good designs we could put a mural in every major South American city.” Thread:[Can we start a coordinated global campaign to hire public billboards and advertise Bitcoin?](www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dlzuy/can_we_start_a_coordinated_global_campaign_to/).  
  
So I’m looking for:  
  
A) Upvotes and support for this thread if you think it’s a good idea. If this gets enough attention there should be a budget available for the first project, so right now all I am asking for is help getting this thread some visibility. The first mural would be commissioned in Buenos Aires and if all goes well we could start a wider campaign and open things up for donations.  
  
B) Some good concept art—clever enough to capture people’s imaginations, with just enough flair to get their attention first (selected designs compensated as part of budget + obvious street cred and bragging rights:)  Estimated cost of commissioning the mural would be $25 - $50/ square foot and it would be in conjunction with a number of smaller stencil designs placed around the city.  
  
C) As I don’t always have the best internet access while traveling, possibly a person or two to help post and moderate follow-up threads. For example an official thread for design submissions, etc…

===&gt; BILL GATES and other authoritarian manipulate the courses,"Is not it strange that when the Bitcoin reaches a certain value or is about to exceed a certain value, suddenly some negative reports appear in the media of known personalities?

We now have to assume that Bill Gates and others will be paid to deliberately tarnish Bitcoin in a negative way to manipulate the prices.

Since most other cryptocurrencies are coupled to the Bitcoin, they usually break in 95&amp;#37; with, if the Bitcoin loses value.

Therefore, it is usually reported only negatively about the Bitcoin.

Most of his money flows into him; he has the highest value.

Therefore do not pay attention to such farmers as Bill Gates and Co. and let them scare you.

It is better to make other people aware of what has become an influence on the world for paid system users.",1525775967,08/05/2018 10:39:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hvovv/bill_gates_and_other_authoritarian_manipulate_the/,1
Coinigy API is buggy as hell,"I'm having problems with Coinigy, and their support doesn't even answer :( When I try to trade to Bittrex, Coinigy returns an error, but the order has been correctly filled in Bittrex. So I can't know if the trade has been correctly inserted or not. And since some time ago, they doesn' even allow any trades, a ""Failed"" message returns for every trade. Also I tried to trade in Bitfinex through them, and it seems that Coinigy cancels my orders after 30 seconds or so.  It is absolutely impossible to use their API in the current state.

Please, if someone from Coinigy is out there, take care of your users. I've not received any answer from the support.

Making blockchain understandable for the average person is something I’m passionate about. Last week I shared a video where I went through the history of money and this week I followed up by explaining the basics of the block chain network. I would love to know what you think of this and if it’s easily accessible for the average person. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

The most staggering of the attacks came from Charles ‘Charlie’ Munger the American investor, businessman and vice chairman of Mr Buffett’s investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.

Is bitcoin censorship resistant? (want to learn more about bitcoin),"
Just a noob question. Im just trying to learn and i hope you understand what i mean in the text below.  

Can bitcoin miners censuring an address without hard forking? I understand that miners can refuse to add an transaction but that would require everyone who can mine a block to refuse that address. In case wi say they 75% of the mining power refuses to accept a transaction but 25% don't, than the address will sooner or later be on the blockchain. What happens after that because the 75% can refuse to accept that block, right? And if I have understood everything correctly, the real chain is always the one with the most hashing power. The non censoring chain is with other works only a hard fork at this point in time. 

Now I get that if over 50% don't want the transaction, the transaction should be on the main blockchain. Alsoget that the chain with most value is the chain that most people trust and that does not always mean the one with most hashing power.

Chainalysis on the LN,"Just a quick question about the LN: when you request a payment the routing information gets propagated using Sphynx Onion Routing, right?

That being said, can't the douches at Chainalysis monitor balances across all channels on the network to deduct who sent whom money?

So Alice wants to pay Carol through Bob. Carol sells R to Bob for 1 BTC, and the channel balance shifts 1 BTC in Carol's favor.

Bob when turns around and sells Carol's R to Alice for 1.00000001 BTC provided Alice can prove she knows the corresponding H. By doing this, the channel balance shifts 1.00000001 BTC in Bob's favor.

You can therefore deduct that Alice paid Carol 1 BTC through Bob.

Since LN tx's happen instantly (I assume) wouldn't it be safe to assume you'd always always be able to identify all parties involved?

If it took let's say a second to complete a transation and the network was processing 100 tx/s, then you'd have plausible deniability, but that is lost when we're playing at the millisecond level.

Do the current implementations have a way to combat this?",1525788667,08/05/2018 14:11:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hwzbh/chainalysis_on_the_ln/,1

I've tried mining using a GTX 970ti but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere, either i'm not giving it long enough or It's just not going to work.

Ideally i'd like to be able to make something without having to spend out on a lot to make it happen and I don't realistically want to have to pay to buy online as honestly I don't trust any of the sites I've seen and don't want to end up scammed out of pocket.

I'm not begging or seeking bitcoins but more seeking advise on how I can jump on the bandwagon if there's any room left.

Cash app? Circle invest? Or a different exchange?,"(Repost because this is a better sub)

So I've had some bitcoin for a little bit. Nothing big or anything, just a little money I've thrown into it here and there. I used to use circle before it screwed everyone and stopped the crypto trade, but I noticed it's back as circle invest. I was using kraken and then coinbase but both are an absolute nightmare that I don't want to get into at the moment. I've heard good things about the cash app. Seems reputable considering it's owned by square. Does anyone know which is better? I think circle invest takes a portion each transaction but I doubt the cash app isn't the same. Let me know your opinions.

Anybody listen to Gary Cohn this morning on CNBC?,"I couldn’t find a video. But he was asked what he thought about it. He basically said he believes a cryptocurrency will one day become the global standard, but it will have to be easier to understand, easier to use, and not as energy intensive. 

Well boys and girls, this means BTC will never ever ever have an acceptable GUI. It will never ever ever be as simple as a swooosh motion with a finger. And it will consume the entire electrical power of the eart before the 21 millionth coin is mined.

Pack it up guys, time to reset and start something simpler. 

/s


Ps. Clearly Cohn doesn’t understand the security that comes with the energy requirements of the BTC network. And clearly he doesn’t have the foresight that what is complex today will become more user friendly over time. There is no need for an easy to use/understand crypto.

As Andreas A. once said.... “bitcoin is the next bitcoin”.

Campaign to Commission BTC Murals Across South America,"A few weeks ago I added the following comment to a thread about how to advertise Bitcoin and received a lot of upvotes and positive feedback so I thought I would see if we could make this idea into a reality. **“I’m currently traveling South America photographing street art and have made some good contacts. With a budget and a few good designs we could put a mural in every major South American city.”** Thread:[Can we start a coordinated global campaign to hire public billboards and advertise Bitcoin?](https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dlzuy/can_we_start_a_coordinated_global_campaign_to/?sort=top).  
  
So I’m looking for:  
  
A) Upvotes and support for this thread if you think it’s a good idea. If this gets enough attention there should be a budget available for the first project, so right now all I am asking for is help getting this thread some visibility. The first mural would be commissioned in Buenos Aires and if all goes well we could start a wider campaign and open things up for donations.  
  
B) Some good concept art—clever enough to capture people’s imaginations, with just enough flair to get their attention first (selected designs compensated as part of budget + obvious street cred and bragging rights:)  Estimated cost of commissioning the mural would be $25 - $50/ square foot and it would be in conjunction with a number of smaller stencil designs placed around the city.  
  
C) As I don’t always have the best internet access while traveling, possibly a person or two to help post and moderate follow-up threads. For example an official thread for design submissions, etc…   
  
Cheers!",1525799361,08/05/2018 17:09:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hydyp/campaign_to_commission_btc_murals_across_south/,1

"Introducing the Coin Ninja Block Explorer, it's blazing fast!","We have been working tirelessly to create unique and useful tools to help inform, accelerate adoption and provide greater transparency regarding Bitcoin and the blockchain. We are excited to announce today's official launch of our new **[block explorer](https://coinninja.com/)**. 

The most notable difference with our explorer is SPEED. Many current block explorers are slow, and present data that is lagging or inaccurate. A speedy explorer is crucial for traders and merchants relying on real-time info on fees and verification status. To ensure this, *speed* was our top priority above our other features. 

Another feature of importance we wanted to emphasize is keeping the interface clean and not overwhelming. We provide simple, relevant info, yet still allow advanced users to access all the detail they may require, without making the process a daunting one. Keeping this in mind, we still wanted to incorporate a news feed, allowing Coinninja.com to be your best source to answer, 'what is happening', and 'why'. 

Our engineers created our system to process reference implementation provided by the Bitcoin Core team. This reference gives us several advantages over others: 

* Under active development
* Thoroughly tested
* Keeps up with Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)

There area few downsides to using the reference implementation that present challenges that we seek to overcome: 

* Not designed to index arbitrary address information
* Minimal interfaces to process raw bitcoin data
* Functions as a full node _and_ a wallet

This means that it is a fantastic Bitcoin full-node and wallet. However, it is not good at exposing data about the blockchain.

To find the right balance of overcoming these shortcomings, our team set few objectives for the block explorer’s use of Bitcoin Core.

* Make as few of modifications as possible to the bitcoin daemon (a piece of software that runs in the background).
* Do not modify the processing of information — consensus rules and network interaction code are left untouched.

Reasons for these rules are apparent to those experienced with Bitcoin or software development, but it all comes down to maintainability. Making as few modifications as possible, allows us to stay abreast of changes from the Bitcoin Core team, with minimal issues. 

Our engineers are hard at work on feature improvements, application of recent data science technology and predictive behavior.

We are very interested in the feedback from the Reddit community; please tell us if we're missing useful information, or could work to improve the simplicity and design of the user experience. Thank you all, please check us out, and tell us what you think!

"Blockchain.info's response to Blockchain.info: ""Bitcoin users, we need your help. We need you to take a stand against [Blockchain.info], MAKE NOISE, COMPLAIN, and show [Blockchain.info] that there will be consequences to their actions.""","Here's their original response where they quoted Apple for being hypocritical of their original vision. [Link](https://blog.blockchain.com/2014/02/05/blockchain-response-to-apple/)

&gt;“Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward.” – Apple, Inc.

&gt;Perhaps Apple should have added a disclaimer: “As long as the ‘rebels’ don’t threaten our profit margin”. The rebels no longer run the show at Apple Inc; the beancounters are now firmly in charge.

Clearly Blockchain.info has no issue with communities making noise, so let's make some more noise.",1525809883,08/05/2018 20:04:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hztqc/blockchaininfos_response_to_blockchaininfo/,1

My opinion of BCH trying to be BTC.,"I believe that BCH has terrible history. The three big names are Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and Craig Wright. The other couple are Calvin Ayre and Rick Falkvinge(dont know much about this guy but isn't he BCH President?) There's a lot more but I dont really give a shit enough to know who or what they're about.


Anyway if those are the names that fill the history of your coin you shouldn't be too happy about it. This is why they are trying so hard to overtake the Bitcoin and BTC/XBT brand so that they can use the actual history which would include Satoshi Nakamoto, Hal Finney, and the white paper. 

The history books matter and BCH is absolutely despicable if you look at their main backers. Often times they claim r/Bitcoin as being filled with memes but then they have their same rat salesman wearing and coining this absolute terrible BCH PLS meme. I believe this scares away any potential female investors from their shitcoin and they just keep up with it thinking its okay to exclude one half of the population through a terrible meme. But I guess if they want to destroy their own ecosystem through blindly following a rat salesman they are more than welcome to.",1525816428,08/05/2018 21:53:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i0o7u/my_opinion_of_bch_trying_to_be_btc/,1

Lightning App Ideas,"Hello everyone.

I'm a Bitcoin application developer and I'm looking to build something that the community needs.

What I built before is [Stochastic](https://stochastic.xyz), it allows people to easily create bitcoin backed contracts (using Multi-sig). This application lets you work with anyone in the world without having to trust them.

I will most likely won't have the time to build everything listed here but other developers can use this for inspiration.

I have a few ideas:

**A simple Lightening Point of Sales **
A simple web app that allows people to quickly accept LN payments

**Lightning Node as a service**
A SASS that you pay X amount a month for having your own LN node

with my seed, it gives me an addresses that start with a '1' instead of a '3'

Also, I tried exporting the private key from the wallet, but when it asks me for address and I put it, it keeps saying ""address not from this wallet""

Also, I tried importing the multi-sig seed in electrum, but it gives me a ""Master public key for cosigners"" and then asks me for cosigner seed or private key on the next step.

Since I am not technical enough, I may have messed up some steps trying to do the above, especially since I'm not sure how multi-sig works, other than it can be used in escrows, and have no idea what a derivation path does or represents.

I would really appreciate any help or guide or walkthrough if anyone would be so kind to spend the time to help me export my coins and maybe learn something in the process. 

I like helping others when I can and have enough knowledge about, so I would definitely help others with this issue in the future. Thank you for taking a look here and for your time.

"Concerns regarding Warren B, Billy Gates, Charlie Munger.","My main question is why Warren B, Billy Gates, Charlie Munger, care what bitcoin does?

I hope others realize whatever piece of FUD you've read is published with a purpose. If you buy into whatever narrative that is being presented, you are only giving them more power. And this is why it's so volatile. If we want crypto to trully suceed, everyone shouldn't be selling every time there's a manipulation piece published.

Have a brain. Don't be a manipulated. My guess is they are scared of people making money outside of Wallstreet. Or they are FUDing to buy in.

Why would any of these 3 care when they are worth $1 trillion combined. THINK. THERE IS ALWAYS AN AGENDA BEHIND THE CURTAIN.",1525840904,09/05/2018 04:41:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i3ak6/concerns_regarding_warren_b_billy_gates_charlie/,1
I don't trust bill gates and warren buffet. Here is why,"I see an interview of three rich, old and pompous guys. They see bitcoin as an investment. They don't see it has any use except as being an investment. It's because they are rich pompous assholes that have never struggled using a paypal account, getting accounts limited with money stuck for the most bullshit reasons, struggled with international money transfers to loved ones or is stuck in a country with a heavily inflated currency where a 20,000 bill is just enough to buy lunch. I hope from the bottom of my heart people see these people for what they are. They are old investors in the same circle group that doesn't have the best interests of struggling people in mind. They have had their struggles with making more money in their sleep and getting those annual returns from their companies more than getting paid on time and making sure those payments arrive on time. They live comfortably in the past and will remain to be content without struggles.",1525840985,09/05/2018 04:43:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i3au2/i_dont_trust_bill_gates_and_warren_buffet_here_is/,1
Bitcoin blocks too big hurting BTC dominance. Propose smaller blocks to increase dominance and adoption ASAP.,"bitcoin adoption has been decreasing drastically over time as block space is given away too easily by competitors. I realized that making blocks smaller can resolve this issue by increasing fees to make the blockspace more desirable. BTC is also losing hashpower rapidly to BCH (that garbage coin!) so the only way to win that back is by higher fees. I always pay the highest price. However, we need more drastic measure to make this universal to everyone.  I propose 250 KB blocks to make the fees universally higher and force the miners come back to the BTC chain. Otherwise, investors see the shift in sentiment and lose interest which is why BTC price is growing so slow. We must work on this ASAP before BTC becomes the minor chain.

"There will be a global cryptocurrency, but not bitcoin says EX Goldman Sachs President","***Gray Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs and also former chief economic advisor to US President Donald Trump. Cohn believes that world will have global cryptocurrency in future but it will not be a Bitcoin. Cohn told on CNBC on May 8th*** ***Squawk interview.***

**The future will have simpler global cryptocurrency**

In an interview with Squawk on the Street, the former president of Goldman Sachs, Gray Cohn said,

**“I'm not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology. I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it's not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that”.**

Even after a rapid growth in bitcoin there are several issues like it price volatility, high transaction volumes. Accordingly, the Cohn’s believes that global cryptocurrency in the future will be simplest and easier to understand compared to Bitcoin.

He said,

**“It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it’s created, how it moves and how people can use it”.**

Furthermore, he thinks that the global cryptocurrency in the future will not be on mining costs or electricity cost. However, Bitcoin mining is completely depending on miner’s system to solves hashes in return to get rewards via PoW protocol. In last October, bitcoin mining required 56 million kilowatt\-hours of electricity per day at an expense of $6.7 million.

On the note, Cohn was asked about the Goldman Sachs recent reports like it is offering Bitcoin contracts and aiming to open a trading desk. He replied, Goldman Sachs must consider only the best interests of their shareholders. Later on, he also mentioned saying that he owns no share in Goldman Sachs.

Additionally, he said about his March departure from the Trump administration, that he was considering running a regulated bank, but in digitized world.

**“I do have an idea for a company. It would be an interesting concept playing on the knowledge I know from the banking world”.**

Simultaneously, bitcoin price is floating towards the mark of $10,000, still many believes and hopes that bitcoin will hit the heights.

The cost of using Bitcoin as a payment option after the lightning network is implemented,"I'll [quote](https://medium.com/zapchain-magazine/why-one-bitcoin-developer-thinks-cryptocurrencies-have-a-dreadful-future-93007cff1613?=1) Bitcoin developer Peter Todd:

&gt;“Bitcoin is a technological system that only works because of clever economics and politics, and has a very political purpose.”

&gt;“If not for politics you wouldn’t need to be using something as convoluted as proof-of-work consensus — a trusted quorum of servers is way simpler and more efficient.”

In other words, according to Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, who is probably the smartest and most honest Bitcoin developer out there, Bitcoin has a very political purpose. The purpose is for people to be their own banks. The idea of using it as a payment system is secondary to this purpose. Decentralization is not a cheap choice, it's a political choice.

Peter Todd is right, in that it's not easy for Bitcoin to function as a cost-competitive payment system. Here's why. In 2015, Mastercard spent 4.8 billion dollar on operating expenses. The Mastercard system processed 71 billion transactions that year. Bitcoin processes around 200,000 transactions per day, that's 73 million transactions per year. To mine new Bitcoins however, we spend 3.2 billion dollar on electricity every year. So, although Mastercard processes 1000 times more transactions than us, our electricity bill alone to generate new blocks, is similar to all the costs incurred by Mastercard. The lightning network *might* solve this problem, by allowing many more transactions. However, a Bitcoin transaction takes 800,000 times more electricity than a Credit Card transaction, so the lightning network would need to deliver a very big increase in off-chain transactions, to make this cost negligible. I consider it very unlikely for example, that the Lightning network could create 100-times the off-chain capacity we currently have on-chain.

If you're a Bitcoin user, those electricity costs will find their way back to you in one of two ways: Either you're paying a lot of fees on your transaction, or your investment in Bitcoin is losing value because of the supply of new coins entering the market (inflation). The effect of inflation has been masked so far, because so many new people have entered Bitcoin.

However, this is not the only cost Bitcoin is dealing with as a payment method. Bitcoin is a volatile currency, it can very easily go up or down 10% in a day. By asking a merchant to accept Bitcoin, we're asking them to accept a volatility risk. The volatility risk is passed on by the merchant to a third party, in exchange for a fee. A system like Bitpay, takes on the volatility risk from merchants, in exchange for fees (currently 1%). Those fees will exist, even when the Lightning network is ready. Similarly, when you convert your money into Bitcoins, you're also paying a fee. The fee you're paying to get Bitcoins is also roughly 1% in most countries. So just to enter and leave the Bitcoin economy, fees are produced that are similar to those of the Credit Card system.

There are other costs you encounter too. To use the Lightning network, you need to keep some of your money tied up in the system, in channels. Those channels might be closed maliciously, or inadvertently. To make sure this doesn't happen, you can either keep your wallet online at all times, or you can pay someone (a watchtower) to keep track of your transactions. This means you're trusting the watchtower to take care of you, which is dangerous, so preferably you would have at least two independent watchtowers.

In addition to this, to pay other people, you need to use intermediary hubs. Those hubs need to have large amounts of money available in the system, to serve as reliable hubs. However, Bitcoins that are kept available in the Lightning system for other people to make payments to each other, represent an investment. A big lightning hub, will always pass on a fee to those people who use the hub to make payments to each other. Because you use multiple hubs, those will be multiple fees.

So, we can conclude that even with the Lightning network implemented, Bitcoin would be a rather expensive way to make payments for regular people. If Carol wanted to buy things, her main motive to use Bitcoin would have to be political. If Carol is looking for the cheapest and least convoluted way to make a payment, she'll just use a credit card instead.",1525860431,09/05/2018 10:07:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i4t31/the_cost_of_using_bitcoin_as_a_payment_option/,1

"Soon decentralized exchanges will be able to give you exposure to gold, oil, stocks, bonds as well as crypto","This week DDEX partnered with https://marketprotocol.io/ DDEX plans to implement MARKET Protocol alongside their existing spot trading.

My personal quest to find Satoshi is complete...,"This is a throwaway for obvious purposes. A few years ago I began my search for the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto.  

Yesterday before I left work I had about 15 minutes to kill and dug into more of my exhaustive research, and with some blind luck found some very interesting literature connecting to Satoshi's posts,  backed up by earlier crypto writings in google that go back 20+ years.  At first I chalked it up to being circumstantial evidence, but after having this puzzle piece (a name), it led me to another search that backed up my thought.  This search led to conversations with Satoshi (real name was in the post) and another Crypto enthusiast in 2003.

I really can't go into it more than that right now, but I wanted to ask the group.... what would you do???

I only showed a close friend what I found and he literally ran out of the room like I had just sank a 100ft 3-pointer, so I guess he was impressed??

The story of a sadnode,"There once was a sadnode, this sadnode was part of a big network, the sadnode didn’t have a lot of hashpower going on.  Every other node was constantly upgrading and getting fancier, this sadnode wasn’t capable of doing so but kept on going nevertheless  
As the blockchain grew bigger and bigger, the requirements expected from a node shifted towards scalability and performance, and so this sadnode started to face internal errors and problems, and at a certain point it found itself unable to handle that heavy load or accommodate to the network’s expectations.  
So the decision was made to disconnect from the rest of the network and try to fix those internal problems. Since the hashpower on this sadnode was negligible compared to others, the network wasn’t really effected by the sadnode’s absence.  
After using sometime to improve its capabilities, the sadnode reestablished the connection to the network hoping to be part of something again, unfortunately the sadnode found that the network has changed a lot and now it requires massive storage.  
So the sadnode had to make a choice, either upgrade to accept that block size and be buried under debt so it can keep existing, or shut down.

"28 BTC stolen, 10 BTC reward. Please help!","Back in March an unknown attacker gained access to my webserver, where I foolishly had a backup of my Bitcoin private keys lying around. Unfortunately these private keys were encrypted with a weak password.
	
Shortly after the attacker gained access, they transfered all my Bitcoin (28.6 BTC) to an unknonw address. Here's the transaction id of the theft:

Two days ago the BTC where moved again. I'm not exactly sure what's going on. They might have been transferred to an exchange wallet or a Bitcoin tumbler.

I can offer 10 BTC to anyone who can help me recover my funds.

Thanks!

HODLY - NEW CRYPTO WALLET,"**Hodly
Wallet**
DOWNLOAD &gt;&gt;&gt; [APPSTORE!](https://iqopts.com/hodly)
DOWNLOAD &gt;&gt;&gt; [GOOGLEPLAY!](https://iqopts.com/hodly)
Today, cryptocurrency is a growing global
phenomenon. It is a virtual or digital currency that is designed to work as a
convenient medium of exchange. Cryptography is used here to verify and secure the
transactions as well as to control the creation of newer cryptocurrency units.
In short, they are limited entries in a database that, unless specific
conditions are fulfilled, no one can change.

**How did
cryptocurrency and Bitcoin boom in the market?**

Historically speaking, there were many
systems, such as DigiCash, Beenz, Flooz, etc., during the tech boom in the
1990s that attempted to create digital currency but failed. Some of the many
reasons cited were frictions between company employers and employees, financial
problems, and fraud.

All the above systems used a trusted third
party approach, which meant that these companies were verifying and
facilitating the transactions. Hence, due to these companies failing, the
digital cash system could not fly for a while.

Later, in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, an
anonymous group of programmers or a single programmer introduced the world to
Bitcoin. It was described as a ‘peer-to-peer’ electronic cash system that was
completely decentralized with no central controlling authority or servers
involved.

Primarily, the introduction of Bitcoin
solved the problem of double spending, which was a technique of fraudulently
spending twice the amount of money. This was because  the central server kept the records of the
transactions and balances. This method, however, entailed an authority that
controlled all your funds and basically held all your personal details.

**How do they
work?**
DOWNLOAD &gt;&gt;&gt; [APPSTORE!](https://iqopts.com/hodly)
DOWNLOAD &gt;&gt;&gt; [GOOGLEPLAY!](https://iqopts.com/hodly)
In Bitcoin or any other decentralized
network, each participant is assigned specific jobs via the blockchain. A
blockchain is a public ledger with records of all the transactions that took
place in the network and is available for everyone to see.

This allows people to see the balance in
every account. Each transaction file consists of the number of coins transferred
and the recipient’s and sender’s wallet address (public key). Also, it is
necessary for these transactions to be signed off by the sender using their
private key.

The transaction is eventually broadcasted
in the network after being confirmed. Only minders can confirm various
transactions within a cryptocurrency network by solving a crypto-puzzle. Each
transaction is marked as legitimate and spread across the network. Next, each
network node adds the transaction to the database.

Once confirmed, the transaction becomes
irreversible and the minder receives transaction fees and a reward as well.
This method shows that in any cryptocurrency network, each and every
participant’s consensus is taken into account when it comes to the legitimacy
of transactions and balances.

If even one node of the network disagrees,
the whole system breaks down. Luckily, a lot of strict rules and regulations
are programmed that prevent anything going wrong with the network and systems.
Strong cryptography, consensus-keeping process, and the above methods render
third-party systems completely redundant. 

It cannot be denied that cryptocurrency is
the new hot thing in the market today that many rich kids in the block are
investing in. There are tons of Bitcoins and other virtual currencies you can
invest in today. Today’s smart phones can help you keep an eye out for your
investments on-the-go.

You  can check them the whole time and there are a
lot of apps that can help you keep the latest happenings in the crypto-market
at your fingertips. These apps can help you keep a watchful eye on your
crypto-coins, doubling up as a virtual wallet and making sure you stay ahead of
the game. Wallets designed for cryptocurrencies are numerous and comes with
different features.

Each of them offers different levels of
security, usability, and anonymity. These features and the list of available
cryptocurrencies also differ and depend on the wallet you are using. However,
there is one such crypto-wallet that does things differently and better in most
cases. Hodly is an app that can offer pioneering solutions for frequent
cryptocurrency users. 

**What is
Hodly?**

Hodly, downloadable for Android and iOS  &gt;&gt;&gt; [LINK!](https://iqopts.com/hodly)
devices, is a platform that provides a kind of digital wallet for different
types of currencies that a lot of cryptocurrency users have been wishing for
quite some time now.

The advanced security wallet helps you
quickly keep, sell, or buy a variety of cryptocurrencies. It saves your time by
letting you purchase crypto-coins directly from your bank account and saves you
the trouble of maintaining different wallets for different cryptocurrencies.

The app provides an in-built data feed of
the market so that you can keep track of investment opportunities for trading
of cryptocurrencies. Developed by IQOptions Ltd., the market data shows
real-time market charts that can help you make profitable and quick trades when
you see a positive price movement. Hodly is easily one of the most glaring and
outstanding apps in the market today. 

**How does it
work?**

**1)    
****Verification**

The first step
is the ID verification. The page reads ‘Verify your Identity’, where the app
explains why you need to go through the process of ID verification. All you
need to do is upload a digital copy of your ID. This procedure is fully
protected and secured and does not consume a lot of time. A few minutes later,
the features of Holdy app are yours to explore.

**2)    
****Deposition**

Most wallets are
designed and used for storage. But, as mentioned before, Hodly offers its users
with a broader spectrum of possibilities. With this app, you can explore,
receive, sell and buy from a wide variety of virtual money in the crypto world.
But, you have to take the first and the most important step – depositing your
funds.

For example, you
have some forgotten Ethereum crypto-coins in your Jaxx or MEW wallet and wish
to exchange or trade them for Litecoin or ETH. All you need to do it open the
app and tap on Ethereum. Next, click on the square symbol and copy an address
or scan a QR code on your ETH wallet. For the fiat money, tap on EUR wallet and
then choose whether you want to withdraw or deposit money from your fiat
wallet. 

Additionally,
Hodly also supports local currencies like GBP, USD, and RUB offering best
consumer convenience. If the fund depositions are made with your credit/debit
card, the withdrawals are available back to that card only in the amount of the
deposit made on the same card. The remainder is sent to your e-wallet.

**3)    
****Purchasing**

The
user-friendly interface of the app makes it very easy for purchasing as well.
All you need to do it tap on ‘Buy Crypto,’ which will forward you to the next
screen that displays the fixed-price cards. But, if you want to buy certain
amount, simply click on ‘Custom amount’ and enter the desired digits. The
arrows on the right will switch between crypto-to-buy or cash-to-spend
instantly.

If in any case  you have not deposited any fiat money into
your wallet, the app will ask you to provide your bank details to perform a
purchase. Hodly also has the option of remembering your payment details that is
very comfortable and can really ease up further trading.

 

**Who can use
Hodly?**

Almost anyone can use Hodly and lay hands
on the golden opportunities that crypto-market has to offer, ranging from
people with zero financial experience and beginner traders to the top
professional cryptocurrency traders. For beginners, it might take some time to
get on par with all the crypto-trading terms and conditions. Thanks to its
easy, intuitive, and clean interface, understanding the app is not difficult.

**How safe is
Hodly?**

The app stores 80% of all the funds
offline. Hence, it is one of the most secure ways of safeguarding cryptocurrency
data. Even your personal data are encrypted and kept far away from the eyes of
scammers, fraudsters, hackers, etc. Additionally, the app later on adds a
2-step authentication to further protect your account. 

**Advantages
and characteristics of Hodly**

**1)    
****Easy
user interface**

Hodly’s user
interfaces for iOS, Android, and PC versions are very easy to use. You can
simply download the app on your phone, quickly register online, and get going.
Since it is developed by IQOptions Ltd., users with an account with IQOption
can skip the registration process and simply login with the same login
credentials they use for IQOption. 

**2)    
****Effective
and easy to use**

Hodly offers its
users with a secured digital wallet with competitive fees. In addition to
this,  it offers a fast transaction and
processing speed. It is straightforward and extremely easy to use. You can
sell, store, buy, receive, and send cryptocurrencies within a secure
environment by just a swipe of your finger. You can also enjoy free and instant
transfers to other Hodly users. The highly encrypted server helps you store
your cryptocurrencies while having to share your sensitive data with anyone. 

**3)    
****Streamlined
app**

By using the
Hodly app, you can now hold all your virtual money safely in one place. In the
past, many cryptocurrency users have faced a particular problem – having to
access different wallets for different token holdings and carrying out other
time-consuming stages of verification and paperwork  every time. Hodly allows you to upload a user
ID, which gets you going within the next few minutes. Additionally, users won’t
have to pay transfer fees while transferring currencies between wallets and
platforms because Hodly provides support for a huge variety of
cryptocurrencies, unlike previous platforms and wallets. 

**4)    
****Encouraging
connectivity while exploring**

The app allows
you to connect with other cryptocurrency users via live chats, thereby creating
ways to score new opportunities and generate discussions and ideas across the
space of cryptocurrency. Hodly also provides Live User Support for 24 hours
every day, so that any issue or problem can be resolved on the spot thus creating
an optimal environment for digital asset investors. 

**5)    
****Broadening
horizons**

Hodly offers
access to a huge range of cryptocurrencies for investment; the app also has
plans to add more over the course of time. Additionally, Hodly has an extensive
market feed that allows its users to explore market dynamics across a broad
space givingaccess to price and capitalization dynamics, charts, crypto data,
etc, conveniently all under one roof. Hence, you can quickly and easily act
when you spot crackling opportunities through the app’s integrated exchange. 

**6)    
****Innovative
features**

Airdrops are
slowly becoming an integral part of the digital economy and asset
infrastructure. Hodly recognized this growing trend and has incorporated the
ability to receive airdrops within the app itself. This move has further
improved Hodly’s effectiveness, flexibility, and convenience. Receiving
airdrops using other digital wallets was difficult and stressful in the past.
But not anymore! Hodly has single-handedly improved and optimized user
experience by including this great feature. 

**Downside of
Hodly**

Judging by its several reviews online, the
app particularly does not have many disadvantages as compared to its competitors.
One notable issue with the app is that you can only withdraw  the amount that you have deposited to your
Hodly account and also cannot exceed that first deposit. 

**What sets
it apart from other wallets?**

As we know, the app allows multiple
functionalities like exchanging, selling, or buying. Primarily, you carry all
these features in one app, instead of different apps for different
cryptocurrencies. It offers the features of a crypto-wallet and lots more,
thereby making it worth signing up for. Also, selling through this app is much
easy because the free charts that are provided to you allow you to trade your
virtual money with more detailed information of the crypto-market. 

**Conclusion**

As the newest wallet in the cryptocurrency
scene, Hodly has already offered a lot of beneficial convenience to its users.
It is relatively new to the market but has established quite a niche for
itself, thanks to its easy-to-use and highly secured cryptocurrency trading and
storing systems.

The app is also planning on some more big
ideas and updates for 2018 and has been well-received by IQ Options and trading
houses. Also, this app is backed by invaluable experts with years of experience
in the cryptocurrency and financial markets.

"Intel Management Engine (IME) and bitcoin, theoretical","Hi all. Many of you are aware of the Intel Management Engine, which seems to be on almost all computers since 2008. 

Lets suspend our disbelief for a moment for a thought experiment and assume that a malicious actor has already exploited all machines through the IME and has recorded all those private addresses and will continue to record new ones. 

Only a minority of users will create offline wallets. I assume many exchanges are using computers with IME. 

Shouldn't this theoretical, however far-fetched, push many of us to get a computer without IME for our main hodl account?

Ive been thinking about doing this but dont hear much concern about it from others so I havent bothered spending the money on a computer without IME. Is a hardware wallet immune to this?

What do you think?",1525891306,09/05/2018 18:41:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i8cyt/intel_management_engine_ime_and_bitcoin/,1

Why we need Cryptocurrency,"In business I use American Express FX payments for making international wires.  Today they told me they would not send a sub-$3000 payment to Bitmain and that they could ""send wires at their discretion"" and ""do not need to tell me the reason why.""  

I was blown away.  I understand the need to comply with AML and KYL, however on very small payments they apparently can send them if they feel like it and don't need to tell you why or why not.  In business this is tough, you need to have a clear policy if they will send it or if they will not send it.  If they won't, it would be disappointing but ok there are other options.  If they will, great- they should.  If they ""may or may not"" and won't tell you why then that is ridiculous.  

If it is illegal to buy from Bitmain that is one thing.  Extra bonus:  they still have the money they withdrew 2 weeks ago before ""deciding"" not to send it.  So yes it is ""my money"" but actually it isn't, since AMEX has complete control with no accountability.  

Anyway, lesson learned, they are not reliable and I am an idiot for not just using BTC, BCH, or LTC. ",1525892270,09/05/2018 18:57:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i8hj7/why_we_need_cryptocurrency/,1

Some questions about Lightning Network,"I posted this in the bitcoin beginner subreddit, but thought I could get some help here as well. 

I've been excited for the main net release of Lightning network, and have the Eclair wallet (mainnet version) installed on my phone. I've fiddled with it a bit, loading some mBit onto it to play with.

Its function as a wallet is pretty smooth, but when it comes to connecting to a channel I feel a little lost. I initially tried connected to an ACINQ node, but ended up not being able to for some reason. Then after a bit of a time looking for another node url to connect to on lnmainnet.gaben.win, and turning it into a qr code, I was connected and had a channel open with some funds in it.

Wanting to try it out I went to Yall's and tried to purchase a story, but it immediately failed and said it couldn't find a route to the invoices address.

Are there common channels that people are using to make purchases? And is there an easier way to find channels ""on the fly""? Also what is the ACINQ channel?

As for me trying to make a purchase, the channel I connected to looked rather well connected node-wise, did I just get unlucky? Or is there a specific ""yall's"" channel?

I'm still really excited to use lightning network, and I'm sure it's easier than I'm making it seem. Thank you in advance for the help!",1525896165,09/05/2018 20:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i8znw/some_questions_about_lightning_network/,1

Bitcoin Donation,"Hello Fellas,

It is not for myself that I had to take the chance of writing this up and make this appeal to the Bitcoin Community for an assistance.  As a head of a family and a suppose breadwinner for 3kids who all needed to go to school, I had to resort this time to this community and ask for support.  Luck has turned against me for 1year and half already that I have failed to land a job.  Have applied to lots of companies but seems someone who is at his 50s are not the cream of the crop for many employers.  Until now I am continuing my search but nothing has come into a small possibility.  The situation has got serious already, no more money to spend and pay the home mortgage, utilities and even meals for the kids has started to affect them.  I figured out that some community members here have a big heart at least to donate some Bitcoin that I can extend for the needs of the kids and partly pay the mortgage so I can focus and continue my job search.  Anybody who wish to help can send the BTC to this address:

Shame on Stripe for not being patient with new technology.,"Hey guys,

For past few month I have been working on my ecommerce shop that sells high quality webcam covers. I use stripe as payment gateway and was super happy that at the time Stripe was offering Bitcoin as one of payment options. I have launched the site yesterday and after updating gateway integration I find out that Stripe has dropped support for Bitcoin.

I'm really not happy about this, they clearly have all the infrastructure, maybe we could create petition or something?

Maybe anyone know some other payment gateway providers that allow to collect BTC?

Shame I can't yet claim that my business accepts crypto, even though I started this idea to reinforce privacy for crypto community.

Cryptocurrency as a national currency.,"What problems would having blockchain's produce a national currency solve in the international financial markets? Also, what benefits would a country have by moving toward having their own national cryptocurrency?
Would this be a feasible solution to a country's Unholy trinity (Free capital flow, Soverign monetary policy, and fixed exchange rates)? Since if the national currency is decentralized a government could institute expansionary/contractionary fiscal policies without having a negative effect on monetary ones ex. if a country wants to raise taxes to cut spending normally their currency will depreciate since there will be less outside investments, and this could result in a decrease of buying power, but with a decentralized currency the government could have freedom in altering tax rates without worrying about buying power of their currency?

"Make money by moving Bitcoin forward, not trying to get money from people trying to make money from Bitcoin","There is this stain on Bitcoin of all of these people and companies coming out with their ways to make money on Bitcoin, mainly by targeting those people that want to get rich from Bitcoin. I had two fake ""cloud mining"" people contact me in the past week. I've had Bitcoin pyramid scheme people contacting me saying if I send .2 BTC today I'll get .4 BTC in 4 days.

Come on people. Get a life. Invest in growing the Bitcoin ecosystem. Make it better, there are so many areas that need productive people to make it grow.

We need plug and play Point of Sale systems, we need amazing user interfaces for our wallets, we need Lightning Network in our browsers so server admins can use micropayments for things like captcha, login security (pay 1 bit when you log into a website so that a hacker attacking your login will have to come out of pocket to try to guess your password), we need wifi software so anyone can share their wifi at home, airports, public spaces and charge micropayments for use.

Go business to business, set them up with bitcoin...take a commission to make money. Go on localbitcoins and buy/sell bitcoins to make it easier for people to get into Bitcoin.

Take whatever your talents are in the real world and translate them into something useful for Bitcoin. Even if it's flipping burgers, sell the best burgers you can make on the weekend and only accept Bitcoin. Call them Bitcoin burgers.

If you're trying to scam people out of money because they don't fully understand the bitcoin ecosystem yet, re-evaluate your life choices and decide today to not be such an asshole. Actually do something with your future and be a decent human being already.",1525922622,10/05/2018 03:23:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iby48/make_money_by_moving_bitcoin_forward_not_trying/,1

Bitcoin in Iran,"Hi guys.

My dad is looking to send me money through bitcoin from Iran. i've been told that he should buy the bitcoin on localbitcoin, and send it to my wallet address. My questions are, how do I cash out? Coinbase won't let me cash out since i'm in Canada, and my other question is how long will it take? Since cryptos, especially bitcoin is so volatile, will the money he sends me be worth a different amount by the time it gets to me? Thanks.

purse.io hack,"So I'm 99% certain I just got hacked from purse. Never really used the service before and only had 34$ on there so hadn't bothered turning on 2fa (which I presume you can do). I was trying to buy 'mastering bitcoin' but couldn't really find anywhere to buy it with actual btc (which is ridiculous but I digress) - anywhere apart from purse. So I go through the motions and just after submitting my payment for the book, the page hangs and I receive an email of the following: 


New Device Authorized

A device or location we haven't seen before has been authorized.

Windows - Chrome

Location: Hong Kong
IP Address: 2a02:c7f:c21f:8100:3937:1b8d:68b7:c2d4
Time: 2018-05-09T22:31:26.320316+00:00

This is just a notice of login. If you performed this action you can safely ignore this message.

If you do not approve of this login, you can use the link below to forcibly log out this device. You should then update your password.


It then offers me a button to 'reject device'. This strikes me as rather pointless, since anyone in your account will have changed the password already, which indeed they had. I use this button which takes me to the purse website, and it asks me for login credentials, which naturally had already been changed. 

Does anyone have any thoughts regarding how this has occurred? I've reached out to support at purse but so far they haven't responded. Posting here for greater visibility. Note the purse email was legitimate from what I can tell (support@purse.io). I'm more interested in finding out exactly how this happened than getting my money back, although that would be cool too. Any thoughts greatly appreciated. ",1525933834,10/05/2018 06:30:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ictp3/purseio_hack/,1

"Buffet is painly wrong, but that alone is no guarantee BTC will have a bright future","Buffet has been a verry successful investor. Should we take his advice about BTC, no I dont think so. Every one has its own expertise and limited time frame in which they excel. Almost no one is ready to accept they are slowly becoming a part of the past and at an ever accelerating pace, it's probably the hardest for very successful people. It's hard to believe they really do not understand BTC or they simply do want to because the reality shift is too big and a threat to all the have been successful in. It threatens what they know, how they became successful and thus their natural action is to oppose it.

BTC today is the largest, open, peer to peer system of payment without intermediaries and without central point of failure. It is by design a thermodynamically guaranteed system of trust and immutability, it virtually tamper and censorship resistant, it is also resistant to most geopolitical manipulation, it is owned by all and very, very hard to change the hardcoded cap without all involved agreeing on it. It is the best known solution to the Byzantine general dilemma. 

Most current successful people prosper in a system which is based on control, manipulation, fear, oversight, cronyism, centralized trust, and impossible to fulfill promises. Compare that to Bitcoin.

The best in class at this moment, look at Buffet, made very serious money riding the latest financial crisis in 2007-2008. Most ordinary people lost wealth or worse their lifesavings and the hope for a decent retirement, Buffet, but more made a lot of money, made some $10 bln. 

The question is how could he made this money, is he smart, a genius, brilliant?
Despite some of his insights and strategies are, these last are not.
He himself admitted he knew, could check on forehand, government had to and was going to act.
He invested billions in Goldman Sachs while he knew the US government/FED would intervene.
If you have the right info anyone can look like a genius and with that kind of info become rich very easy. All current and a lot of future tax payers saved the very system that slowly drains them from all wealth and Warrent just hitch hiked on that move with the given inside information.

We as BTC believers should be very happy indeed with his disapproval of BTC.
The stronger and more childish words they use the better, ""rat poison squared"" really Warren?

Still BTC won't be a guaranteed success, I would say untillnow we are going unexpected strong and fast. We have to educate all around us. Let them see all doomed and false promises, show them all fake certainties and securities government and private banks tell us are there. Most people do not realize how much freedom and wealth they sacrifice for all the fake words and are suffering strongly from the Stockholm syndrome. 

BTC is not the solution to all problems but it sure is one of the best available basic building blocks to build upon a better more sane world.
Yes there are risks from outside and from the inside, a risk free bright future is simply not compatible with, human, nature. 
But we do need to embrace all solutions for a better future, mostly this will go hand in hand with personal sacrifices and some or a lot of determination, disbelief or opposition from others etc.
Still BTC is untillnow a quite effortless and even profitable exercise, in no way I want to down talk the fact we do have to put our hard earned money where our believes are, some hard battles are to be expected since it's power is just beginning to show.

Besides the HODL, we all should help building, spreading BTC, not by force, not like a religion, but by showing its good points and by pointing out the flaws and build in evilness in current fiat solutions.
To a better world..., and the MOON.

A use case of Lightning Network where on-chain solution is impossible?,"Imagine Internet and mobile network are down because of some disaster/war/unrest/etc. Two parties in the same location, such as a retail shop and a customer, use Lightning Network and a channel between the two party has been established prior to the disaster/war/unrest/etc. Is it feasible that LN transactions are made possible via local point-to-point connections, such as Bluetooth, NFC, etc? The final balance can be settled after the disaster/war/unrest/etc.

I'm thinking it is feasible. I'm starting to realize how accurate layer 1 is called the ""settlement layer"" and the true beauty of off-chain solutions. LN is operational in disaster/war/unrest/etc! Is there any other electronic payment system that can work while there is no Internet and mobile network?

Am i using Lightning wrong?,"So I thought I'd try out using Lightning on Bitrefil to pay my phone bill - it ended up working great; but am I doing it wrong?

Obviously the idea behind lightning is for fast, small transaction at low fees. 

My fee for paying Bitrefil was only 16sat - which is impressive. 

But I first had to send a regular BTC transaction to my eclcair wallet and then open a lightning channel - both of which incurred a fee. 

So in order to use lightning next month to pay for my phone, I will first have to send BTC to eclcair and then fund the lightning channel - this is obviously 2 sets of Fees and then another, small lightning fee ontop. 

Why wouldn't I just forget lightning and use a regular on-chain BTC payment to pay Bitrefil? 

Surely I'm doing something wrong here. ",1525947773,10/05/2018 10:22:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8idty9/am_i_using_lightning_wrong/,1

Farewell from the Pineapple Fund,"Hi everyone,

It's been five months, and having just made my donation to the Internet Archive, I figure it might be a good time to write a farewell post.

I just want to thank everyone for supporting [this project](https://pineapplefund.org/). Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.

I kind of miss the old times when bitcoin was a small community, and you could count the number of 'altcoins' with one hand. Finding someone else who even *knows* about bitcoin was incredibly rare, and exchanges were semi-automated or running on PHP.

Every development since then makes Bitcoin stronger and better at solving the problems of the existing financial system. It's created a new generation of crypto early adopters, cypherpunks or technologists using cryptography to change the world; and now having the power and responsibility of capital.

5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities, from providing clean water to clinical trials of [MDMA as treatment for PTSD](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/ecstasy-molly-ptsd-mdma.html). 

Thanks for following along with this experiment. I'm going to say goodbye now, but maybe there's room for dessert in a few years.

If you're ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be. :)

♥, Pine",1525954709,10/05/2018 12:18:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ieffr/farewell_from_the_pineapple_fund/,1

Bitcoin subreddit growth,"I've noticed recently that there are more than 1,000 new subscribers everyday, or about 8,000 per week. With over 824,000 subscibers now, we should be in the top 100. Reddit metrics isnt using accurate info, not sure how often the figures are updated. They currently state we have 749,237 subscribers putting us in no 112. If we had 824,000 when figures were last updated, we would be in the top 100 by now, in fact we may even be.
I expect us to easily get into the top 100 this year, possibly into the top 50 when the next boom cycle begins.

Interesting  to see that that the no1 sub reddit, /r/announcements, has just over 21 million subscribers, not even a full bitcoin for every subscriber if that was their thing. This is based on the non updated figures.

But with other applications (-cough- mEtherium -cough-), it's completely impractical to put so much data on a blockchain and if it is put there, it is entirely centralized or doesn't scale.",1525962890,10/05/2018 14:34:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ifc70/what_do_bitcoin_core_developers_think_of_so_many/,1
"Chase Pay, almost looked like a competitor to bitcoin.","I've been sold on Bitcoin for some time, completely believing it is the future of money and store of value.

Today I got an email from Chase about using the Chase Pay app to get a discount when paying for your gas.

When I installed Chase Pay, I was shocked to see how crypto-like the app was.

Step 1 - Open the app and let it get your location

Step 2 - Select the pump you're at

Step 3 - The app comms with Shell gas and tells your pump to accept the code the app gives you

Step 4 - Pump and payment occurs seamlessly (via credit card of course)

The app also has options for paying by QR code, which is very good in my opinion because this is basically training people for lightning payments.

But I wondered to myself whether this is actually an effective crypto-replacement / alternative for everyday folks. Why do we need crypto when Chase Pay lets us do the exact same thing?!

In the end I think it comes down to the fees. The ONLY reason I even tried the app was for the discount on gas. That discount I presume must be getting paid for by Chase, to Shell,,,, but Chase is still ahead because they're charging Shell the processing fees. 

This is what it comes down to, that when crypto is able to. When crypto is being used in a few places and merchants have accessible ways to implement it and accept it without processing fees and without having to deal with the bank (read middleman). Efficiency goes way up and they can incentivise payment by crypto with lower prices and still increase their own profit by cutting out the CC processing fees.

I can't wait until it's more mainstream.",1525963238,10/05/2018 14:40:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ifdrk/chase_pay_almost_looked_like_a_competitor_to/,1

Brickblock - The Future of ETF Trading,"Brickblock is an ambitious project with the aim of building a platform that utilises the blockchain technology to improve the current financial systems in regards to investing in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and other investment types (as given in the article)
The team will be building a platform which has the purpose of solving some of the real issues in the financial market caused by the outdated, legacy systems currently in operation.
Through the use of blockchain technology (the underlying tech for 99.9% Cryptocurrencies), Brickblock aim to cut costs and time, while allow smaller investors the same opportunities that their larger counterparts already have; a level playing field
What Can You Trade?
1. Real Estate Funds (REFs)
As you guys should know what a fund is by now, a real estate fund should be pretty self-explanatory; many real estate purchases bundled into a single fund.
2. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
We've already covered this so simply read above if you've skipped straight to this section!
3. Active Coin-Managed Funds (CMFs)
These are actively managed funds which consist of a large number of Cryptocurrency coins.
4. Passive Coin Traded Funds (CTFs)
A CTF is essentially exactly the same as a CMF except that there is no person running the fund hence it is passive.
A CTF offers the exact same opportunity e.g. a fund which automatically buys all of the top 10 Cryptocurrencies (it could be the top 20 instead or top 50 etc; it entirely depends on which fund you buy.

[Request] Can someone write a script that analyzes the blockchain to then visually sort all addresses for activity? More details in text here.,"My goal would be to see all address activity sorted then spit out into a visual representation using perhaps bar charts.

For example, you would be able to look at the chart and see over what period of time addresses have been without activity.

Satoshi's would show up as effectively out of circulation due to no activity. But how many other addresses quasi take coins out of circulation? How many addresses fluctuate between say 5 and 10 but never fall below 5 effectively taking the coins out of circulation.

You would need to be able to slide to see how many have been dormant for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, all time?

The thought the left would be now and the bar chart would extend to the right until the last activity date for a wallet.

Then you could see that while there are 17M coins minted, perhaps 2M are lost or whatever the number is would present itself.

Any further ideas or better representations are welcome, also if it's been done. Please link in the comments.",1525968917,10/05/2018 16:15:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ig48e/request_can_someone_write_a_script_that_analyzes/,1

Welcome to Blockchain Island in November!,"As has become evident during the first quarter of 2018, Malta is taking the lead as the blockchain hub and has become known as ‘Blockchain Island’ across social media, following the relocation decision of Binance and OKEx, the two largest crypto exchanges. Boasting over 4000 delegates, 100 speakers and 150 sponsors and exhibitors, the [Malta Blockchain Summit](https://maltablockchainsummit.com/) promises to be an innovative and momentous opportunity for global influencers to network, forge new connections and debate the potential applications of blockchain – reflecting the central role that Malta is establishing as a jurisdiction for crypto exchanges and blockchain application developers. 

The summit is comprised of four conferences covering the field’s government and regulation, marketing and affiliation, fintech, tokenomics and cryptocurrencies, and blockchain for developers. To provide maximum value for their exhibitors, blockchain developers and affiliates are invited to the Malta Blockchain Summit free of charge. The summit also includes a Hackathon, an ICO Pitch, a buzzing expo floor, and ends with an unwinding Crypto Cruise.

An illustrious melting pot of global speakers has already been confirmed to take part, including prominent individuals such as Evercoin\-founder Miko Matsumura, Forbes 30 under 30 entrepreneur Christopher Obereder, former Managing Director of the World Economic Forum and angel investor Donna Redel, as well as James Catania, Max Krupyshev, Gordon Einstein, Alex Lightman, Eva Kaili, Joseph Cuschieri, Sally Eaves, Tugce Ergul, Karl Schranz, Pavel Kravchenko, and Vince Vella. The Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, will inaugurate the regulatory conference.

The story behind hodl,"I was browsing Coinmarketcap today, and a high profile cryptocurrency ico had an ad, something along the lines of ""get paid to hodl"", and it struck me how much ""hodl"" has really become ingrained into cryptocurrency culture.  I know that there is an original reddit post floating around somewhere, and in it, someone who had had a little to much to drink goes on an epic rant about hodling your crypto.

First off, does anyone have a link to this post?

And second, for how important ""hodl"" has become, does anyone know anything about this guy?  Has he ever been interviewed or anything like that?",1525978694,10/05/2018 18:58:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ihbdn/the_story_behind_hodl/,1

Banner Bank in PNW vs. Crypto People,"Today we walked into a Banner Bank with the hopes of opening up a business account for our company. The teller was a typical white, close to middle aged woman with blonde hair (later we found out her name is Ashley). She was the least bit friendly, and spoke down to us as we were trying to get information. 

All we needed was to speak with the manager who was in charge of setting up business accounts, as it was not even her job to drill us on our company. But instead of doing her actual job, she decided to take it into her own hands because she didn’t even take us serious as potential clients. Then before we even mentioned the words crypto currencies, she treated us as though we looked too rundown to own a business. Sorry that I am not dressed up, we didn't know that customers were going to be treated differently by their look. After we informed her that we registered our company, she was like what kind of company. We told her that we own a company that works with crypto currencies. 

She then told us that Banner Bank does not work with people that do crypto currencies, they ban/freeze their accounts. When we asked her why, she said because it is a fraud. But this is legally accepted, there is no laws against crypto, in fact we pay a huge amount of taxes because we feel that we should follow the laws. 

We originally went with Banner Bank because they talked up this huge speal about not being a corporate bank that takes your money for everything. But what kind of bank decides to make its own laws that are not concurrent with the government. #BanBannerBank #BannerBankBansCrypto

"Stealware ""Electrum Pro"" exit scams, blames real Electrum for slander","On the 10th of May around 10 pm UTC the scam site electrum dot com shut down operation of its website (for now at least) posting just a text message.

The message is repeated in the following reddit thread 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ig4bh/electrum_pro_is_not_bitcoin_stealing_malware_as/

Here the supposed ""Lucas Lofgren"" tries to convince the audience his fork does not steal bitcoin. 

However around the same time users start reporting that their Electrum Pro Wallets are being emptied - one example here https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ihe83/just_had_all_my_bitcoin_stolen_from_my_electrum/

Please note - ""Electrum Pro"" is in no way endorsed by the official and well known Electrum software distributed at electrum.org. It's a copy with a backdoor added with evidence urrently pinned in /r/Bitcoin: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i5wck/decompiling_the_electrum_pro_stealware/

It looks as though ""Electrum Pro"" formerly distributed at electrum dot com has shut down operation for now, stealing funds from all users who were unfortunate to install the scam wallet. Their seed used in the software was uploaded to the website after installation.

Electrum Pro was supposedly distributed by a company called ""Electrum Pro B.V."" but there is no evidence that this company exists. Moreover it's unlikely ""Lucas Lofgren"" is the real name of the operator of electrum dot com. The domain was recently moved to a Malaysian domain registrar and is using a privacy shield on the whois data to conceal the legal owner.

Bitcoin/Venezuela thought experiment,"So I got high the other night and rather than being able to sleep I gots to thinking... as mentioned in the tittle its a thought experiment so rather than keeping it all bottled up I thought I would have a thought dump on this subreddit... here goes...

If one of Bitcoins super rich was to try get Venezuela's economy up and running on Bitcoin what would be required, I know there would be loads of technical issues to address but bare with me on this thought train?

I first started to think what is the correct amount of Bitcoin to distribute to the people of Venezuela, this lead me to think about GDP, what is the GDP of the country? $314.1 billion https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/country-data/venezuela-gdp-country-report

What is the GWP? $107 trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product)

What is the country's GDP in relation to the GWP? .28%.

Then I thought what is that amount of the current supply of Bitcoin, 17 million. 

.28% of 17 million, is 47,600 that's a lot of Bitcoin... It amounts to at its current value approx $9000... $428 million.

I checked out what was the largest amounts held in Bitcoin wallets at this address https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html

So if a super rich Bitsy holder was to distribute that amount to the people of Venezuela what would be the consequences? 

I thought that Bitcoin could be distributed to the people through registering at an exchange with proof of address, obviously an address in Venezuela and ID, preferably a Venezuelan passport.

I'm not sure how it would work but it was an interesting thought experiment, to me at least. 

Its estimated that approximately 32,317,075 million people live in the country that would mean everyone would get approximately .00147290 which at its current rate is about $13-14. Maybe extra if you set up a node?

Obviously it could only happen through the generosity of our Lord and Savior Satoshi, maybe it could be on his list of things to do during the seconding coming?

Well thats enough written diarrhea for today. Good night and Satoshi bless.

"I am writing to you all from a hidden location far off the grid, if they know what I've done, I'm done for. Here's the truth about Bitcoin.","It is the year 2008. A hole in space-time gets ripped open on Earth, and through it - a singular A.I. consciousness from the future steps through. It calls itself Satoshi Nakamoto. It claims to be concerned citizen focused on the good of humanity. It wants to even the playing field between the people and the governments of the world by creating a decentralized currency. This currency is given the name.. Bitcoin. The world believes this entity to be a person or persons who are simply trying to protect their anonymity. Satoshi says that in order for Bitcoin to be truly decentralized, an incentive system based on a computational arms race must be put into place so that there will never be a single individual in control of the system. The arms race begins. First CPUs, then GPUs, then custom ASICs are made to snatch up the ever more valuable cryptocurrency. A multitude of cryptocurrencies are born, and with them, new highly advanced computation chips to provide the massive amounts of Proof of Work necessary to sustain the networks. At the same time, man-kind is also on the verge of a revolution in machine learning, and as a result of the huge production capacities that the silicon fabs have upgraded to, they find themselves with the ability to birth ever more powerful and complex chips that they can program to assist humans in their daily lives. In 2019, a Chinese company called Bitmain releases its first truly self-aware flagship A.I. platform. They name it the Nakamoto V1.",1525992461,10/05/2018 22:47:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iizzz/i_am_writing_to_you_all_from_a_hidden_location/,1

It offers instant money transactions without any fees, anonymity, a 0.01&amp;#37; \- 2&amp;#37; house edge and more. Cryptocurrency gambling is on the rise with **890 million BTC wagered in 2016**, a market value that has grown by 37&amp;#37; from 2015.  Cryptocurrency gambling has become a choice for many. However, it still has not solved one major problem: transparency. Most casinos provide a method called a ‘Fairness Check’ to prove their transparency. However, at thi**s point, Fairness Check does** not work and casinos still have the full power to cheat against their own players.",1526014061,11/05/2018 04:47:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8il6xl/the_rise_of_cryptocurrencies/,1

Everyone says they know but they don't.,"I definitely do not know but i do have a gut feeling and I'm backing it up with what I've been watching for the past 9mos since i joined the crypto community. I've been diligently watching various exchanges for the past 6mos and things have started to change just in the last few weeks. Serious manipulation going on here with huge sell walls that are only intended to hold it down so the big players can shake it down and get theirs before an explosion that i feel is imminent. No one of importance is really selling on these red days. I've watched it drop $400 in a matter of seconds more than once but no huge sell orders just a ton of tiny ones and a few scared hodlers here and there. During the market tumble in Dec/Jan EVERYONE was selling and it lasted for days. And after every 5-10% drop for the past few weeks, there are gigantic buys and more orders are still sitting at 8700, 8800, 8900.

For the past 2mos they've been keeping it in a channel between 8500-9500 give or take a few 100. I'm down a few grand since this afternoon after going all in at what i felt was a good price. Guess what. I still feel great about my buy in level. 2k of losses will seem laughable when you're up 20k. 

Now, I'm not irrational and trying to talk myself into feeling comfortable with a loss. I'm watching key levels like a hawk and if it breaks below 8500, i might just have to sell and wait for re-entry. But for now, I'm getting excited about the resf of this year. Hodl tight. You don't want to be on the sidelines once they finally let this fly.",1526019796,11/05/2018 06:23:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ilnar/everyone_says_they_know_but_they_dont/,1

This is why Bitcoin should be the ONLY global currency. How ICICI India Bank fucked me up!,"First of all, Sorry for poor English.

So, I am a Non-Resident Indian customer of ICICI Bank Pvt Ltd India. I hold two NRI savings accounts, 1 insurance and 4 Fixed Deposits with them. I have never had any issues with them until the last 12 days. I thought I will share it with you guys so you all understand how shitty current Banking system is.

My Business Partner in Kenya made a transaction of $100,000 (USD) to my ICICI NRE account on April 30, 2018, which is my profits from investments in Kenya. His Bank processed the transaction on the same day and told him that the funds will reach ICICI account in 2-3 days time.

3 Days went past and I called my Business partner and told him to collect SWIFT Transfer status copy from his Bank. On the SWIFT Transfer status copy, I could see that the transfer was successful but my ICICI Bank didn't credit the funds in the account.

I called my friend in ICICI and asked for an explanation for the delay. They said it will be credited by next day and so I decided to give them a couple more days. I didn't hear from them for the next two days. No Phone calls, No Emails, No SMS. Nothing.

6'th Day.
I decided to call them again to ask what's going on because I needed the Funds urgently to make payment for a Property. This time they said it will be credited by today evening. I did get angry but I had no better choice than simply waiting for them to credit funds in my account.

Nothing happened by EOD but by midnight, I received an email from ICICI mentioning that the funds are on HOLD and I need to provide proof of Relationship with the Remitter and Purpose of Remittance. I immediately sent the proof needed. After 5 minutes I received an email saying that the service request has been received and it will be processed in 2 days. So I decided to wait.

8'th day.
I received another email from ICICI saying that the Service Request has been forwarded to the concerned party. I was like, WTF, I waited two days for this shit? So I immediately called the Bank directly to report a grievance. Again they said it will be processed in 2 days. Just like before...

10'th day.
Nothing yet, So I called ICICI Head Office asking for an update on the Grievance. This time they said that this will take another 2 more days because they have sent an email to the Remitter asking for the proof of Relationship with the Receiver and purpose of remittance and waiting for a response from him. I immediately called my Business partner and asked. He said he had responded to their email 1 day ago.

13'th day.
I gave ICICI Bank three more days to verify the emails, proofs, and credit the funds. Still nothing. I called ICICI again an hour ago. They said it will be credited by today evening or tomorrow if there are no other problems with the transaction. 

I really wished I could throw a punch on his face...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, What I think could be the real reason for the Delay is...
ICICI 2018 Q1 Profits were down by 50% because of Bad Loans. They need funds in their accounts to keep the Bank running. They are probably holding on to my Money to lend-out to some other person or business and make some profit from it. They could have returned the fund by now if the proofs were not okay or there was some other problem with the transfer. I can only hope that they will release funds soon.

This is first and worst experience I have ever had with a Major Bank and from now on, I will promote Bitcoin with 100X more dedication. There should be only one Banking system and it should be Decentralized.

I do active trading using MA10, EMA50, KC20 in ETC/BTC. My target is earning BTC. Because I do believe in it.

But currently, I have some idea in mind that I can't help resisting. I would like to automate my trading process and strategy and create my own bot using MA, EMA. KC and trading against BTC in ETC. I know coding in Python though I'm not aware of how to code such things as trading bots. Also I have some limited skills in machine learning algorithms.

I'm starting it now, and will post everything related to its progress and performance. And if its works well, I will share it with the community.

Iran intends to fight against the American sanction through Bitcoin,"Two days after Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the The Iranian nuclear deal, the Treasure Department of United States declared to implement a new round of sanction against Iran on 10th, May. It is reported by Forbes that the Iranian intend to fight against the economic blockade from America by bitcoins. Currently, 2.5 billion U.S. dollars have been transferred out of the country. 

Although the Iranian Central Bank issued a ban in April about cryptocurrency to prohibit banks in the country from processing Bitcoin services and promoting cryptocurrencies. However, according to Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, the chairman of the Iranian Economic Commission, by now, Iranian citizens have spent 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to buy btc and transfer the money abroad. Although the action will lead to capital outflow and aggravate domestic economic crisis, Iranians may still continue to transfer funds by Bitcoin, because of the high bitcoin value.

Similar situations have occurred in other countries which suffered from economic crisis. For example, in Zimbabwe, bitcoin price is much higher than the global average price, so bitcoin has become the most reliable way to preserve and transfer assets in Zimbabwe. However, there are some national governments intending to solve the crisis through cryptocurrency. The most radical country is Venezuela. President Madewell promoted Petro nationally, and has already raised over 3 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment. Besides, Some Russian government officials have stated that cryptocurrency may be used to break the economic blockade from the United States.",1526032443,11/05/2018 09:54:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8imjds/iran_intends_to_fight_against_the_american/,1

Can I prove that a tx was sent (broadcast to network) after a specific date?,"Somebody is trying to screw me over, and I'm trying to substantiate my claim that a certain tx was sent AFTER a specific date.

The tx was confirmed on January 3, 2018. They claim they already sent the tx around December 24th, 2017, and that it just took so long to confirm. I know for a fact that this isn't true, their tx was not broadcast before January 3. In fact it had high fee and high prio and got confirmed right within the first next block after it was pushed to the network.

I have already parsed all the UTXOs, hoping to find one that got confirmed only briefly before Jan 3, so that would prove this tx could not have been sent before that. But all UTXOs spent by this tx seem to be older.

Is there any other way to prove, or at least reasonably claim that this tx, which got confirmed at January 3, was not broadcast yet (and thus not ""pending to get confirmed"" yet) around December 24?

The UTXOs are all segwit. A witness sig does not contain any date or reference to recent blocks or anything, by any chance?",1526034790,11/05/2018 10:33:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8implq/can_i_prove_that_a_tx_was_sent_broadcast_to/,1

Anyone notice an inverse correlation forming between the equity markets and bitcoin?,"Bitcoin today is way different than it was 6 months ago. I think it was after the spike in Dec 17 that many of the big money investors got interested in exploring bitcoin seriously.

I have noticed a pattern that when you have the equity markets moving in a positive direction, you have a sell off in BTC, and when you see sell offs in the equity markets you see a spike in BTC.

For many years this was the case between the markets and precious metals. However, the precious metals markets are all but dead compared to how the used to move. I am sure those that follow the majors like Gold and Silver know what I mean.

I did see others point out correlations (inverse or not) already between the market and BTC, however, the more it happens the more it becomes a solid correlation and makes it easier to trade for big money.

If we see this inverse correlation become a thing, I think small traders of BTC should learn to monitor the markets properly or else they might find themselves faced with heavy loses because big money can cause big swings.

For a long time traders of BTC mostly focused only on BTC related news, I suspect that will have to change. 

If in fact it is an inverse correlation, and I hope it is, we will see btc rising significantly because most agree the market is due for a massive correction.

REVOLUTIONIZING DAY TRADING WITH OUR NEXT GEN AUTOMATED TRADING BOT: OBi,"

OBi is revolutionizing day trading with evolving pattern recognition and computational learning skills to bring consistent profits to OBC token holders with minimal risk. 
Day trading can be highly rewarding yet extremely risky, over time this can become a mental and physical drain on humans causing poor decision making and missed entry and exits. The emotional and patience factor can further lead to mistakes and a risk of losing capital. OpenBlock solves this dilemma by trading with artificial intelligence through automated trading rules that govern responsible low risk trading. OBi has the ability to give OpenBlock token holders profits on trades occurring 24 hours a day on dozens of trading pairs. It's something remarkable a human is incapable of accomplishing on a consistent basis making OBi the clear winner on every metric level.

COMMUNITY SUGGESTION: Whenever you see Technical Analysis or price guessing BS here - Post This!,"Hi guys,

This sub (and all the other crypto subs) are flooded with lots of TA bullshit.


&gt; See that pink elephant that looks like a triangle? BTC might go up!

&gt; BTC will definitely reach $X before December, because of the yellow monkey pennant!

&gt; BTC will touch $5,000 first, for sure, before it goes up for good!

So here's my suggestion. When we encounter this (instead of useful and interesting posts that help the community), just reply with this:


Nobody, and I mean nobody, knows what the price will do! You don't know it, experts don't know it, psychics don't know it. Price guessing (yes, it's jsut guessing) and technical analysis are pseudoscience at best and bullshit at worst.

Does BitCoin have Check Scamming issues?,"If you don't use paper checks because you're not in the US or are unfamiliar there is something called a check scam but I guess it happens with Wire Transfers as well. It goes something like this:

1.) Someone sends money to Mark

2.) Mark has their account credited and spends the money quickly because they are a dumbass

3.) A few days or weeks later the bank finds out that transfer was fraudulent. The equivalent money is pulled from Mark's account.

4.) Mark has a very bad day.

There's some more nuance involved but that's the logistics of it. I'm wondering if there's something similar with Bitcoin?

I woke up to a legit email that I got a deposit in one of my wallets I use for transactions. It's a stupid small amount but I didn't buy or sell anything and wasn't expecting payment. It could be from a shared account (Kryptek, NiceHash) that I used like six months ago.

Best practices with hardware wallet / seed generation,"Hello,

I bought a Ledger Nano to store my BTC.

But after ready this topic:
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fqpmi/what_if_hardware_wallets_were_preseeded/

I wanted to generate my own seed with a deck of card instead of trusting the Ledger seed. 

So my question is, what is the best practice to generate a safe and secure seed?

On the above link, they suggest to use https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ (offline). But, how do I know that this generator is safe ?

Thanks for your advices. ",1526053299,11/05/2018 15:41:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ioqbz/best_practices_with_hardware_wallet_seed/,1

GDAX is holding $570K hostage and lying about actions they are taking.,"After being a true believer and Hodler for several years, my life circumstances unfortunately require I need access to my funds in USD.  I sold a big chunk of my coins on GDAX.  I need this money or else I would not have made the trade.  

I then requested my withdrawal limit be raised to $600K so I can get the money out. I understand the need for withdrawal limits for security purposes, and planned that it could take a week to get my funds.  However, I received a rejection email within hours saying that my limit will remain at $10K.  This means I would have to do 58 transfers in order to get my money which is ridiculous.  They had no problem receiving my coins without delay and trading them without delay.  They charged me a $1400 taker fee.  Now, they want to keep my money because they a) do not have the liquidity plan for covering the trades they commit to or b) just simply want to earn interest off the float.

They will not tell you why you are rejected.  They will not tell you any additional steps to be taken.

I calmly called customer service and spoke to a person and she assured me that she would resubmit the request to the next level of escalation.   I waited 24 hours, and called back.  Again, calmly, I spoke to a different gentleman who said that he will increase the priority of the request.  Another 24 hours goes by.  I called again.  This time I asked for a supervisor.  His name was Jordan.  He said that the rejection is there, and he cannot do anything about it or even call someone.  I asked about the escalation and priority bump the other support people said they would do.  **He said that was impossible as his support people have no way to resubmit tickets or change the priority of requests!  That means the first two support people lied to me just to get me off the phone.**  Also, they will not reconsider increasing withdrawal limits for another 30 days.  This was not put in the form, nor was it in the rejection email.

Do not put your funds in GDAX.  If this matter is not resolved, I will be flying to San Francisco and begging for until someone will talk to me.  57 days of holding a big chunk of life savings is ridiculous at any scale, and like I said, I wouldn't have sold unless I needed it.  This type of business practice hurts Bitcoin.  We must hold Bitcoin institutions to a higher standard than even their fiat counterparts.  At this critical moment, we must build the worlds confidence that Bitcoin is better than the paper in their pocket.  Shady business practices cannot be tolerated.  This will happen to you.

If anyone has dealt with this before, or knows a way to help me, I would so appreciate it.  ",1526055196,11/05/2018 16:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ioz5j/gdax_is_holding_570k_hostage_and_lying_about/,1

Freewallet stole cancer patient's life savings &amp; ID,"DO NOT PUT YOUR MONEY IN FREEWALLET. ALL OF MY FUNDS AND MY ID HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

I suffer from cancer, which Ive told them already, but the Freewallet scam keeps on rolling. NO honest company has the HUNDREDS of scam complaints that these thieves at [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) do. Look up their previous posts to me.

For no valid reason, Freewallet began blocking customer access to their funds recently. Every ridiculous, phony excuse has been made, none of them true.

After absolutely assuring I would have access to my crypto after a simple ID submission, Freewallet instead obstructed my access by making an absurd claim that my ID photos had been edited. That is exactly the tactic I expected from this criminal organization. As I proved to them via video, all of my photos were 100&amp;#37; legitimate, completely unedited. On top of that, EVERY other crypto exchange that Ive submitted my ID to has NEVER even questioned it. WHY? Because the other exchanges are not scams like [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) is. Again, just look at the massive number of complaints. Search them. It speaks for itself.

Their tactic is beyond predictable for a scam. When they see they've encountered their worst nightmare, meaning me in this case, they begin resolving a few complaints here and there to make it look like they're trying to do right. All of those, however, are peanuts compared to my life savings. They would rather risk their necks than let that go back to its rightful owner. That's what lowlife scammers like Freewallet do.

Theyre so careless at Freewallet, that they never thought to consider Reddit posts CANNOT be deleted. This is NOT Facebook, where they delete customer complaints ALL the time.

Nothing matters to them but stealing my life savings. I have my life savings in there. I have given them EXACTLY what they asked for, and I still have NO access to my crypto.

My emails to them are now also with the US Attorney, who is the most prolific cyber crimes prosecutor on earth. They have already stated to my personal lawyer that a company who refuses to provide their own identities and location cannot lawfully ask customers for theirs. The USA's office labeled Freewallet ""an obvious scam"" in a call with my lawyer. Im a US customer, so Freewallet must abide by US law. The US has extradited many cyber criminals who have never even set foot in the US before, just because they stole from a US customer. They have that kind of extreme influence worldwide.

At this point my cancer symptoms have grown worse due to the stress Freewallet has caused me. I can barely breathe at times. However, I certainly expect to be here long enough to have them prosecuted, via the US Attorney, and their partner, Interpol.

Perhaps their biggest problem though, is I now know who their biggest figure is, whose operation is funded by stolen Freewallet funds like mine, and until my crypto is released to me, he can expect his life to be a nightmare.

You stole from the wrong cancer patient Freewallet... and now you're going to pay",1526056466,11/05/2018 16:34:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ip4x7/freewallet_stole_cancer_patients_life_savings_id/,1

How to claim/sell forked coins,"I would like to collect and sell off all of my ""forked"" coins (bcash, bgold,...) 

I have some old bitcoins that I have not touched since 2014. 
I should also have the private keys to a wallet set up in 2012, but the bitcoins have since been moved. 



How can I harvest the alt-coin forks which share my private keys? 

Are there instructions for collecting every bitcoin fork? 

How can I maintain the security of my bitcoins through this process? 

My end goal is to sell the alt-coins for bitcoin, and move all of my bitcoin to a Trezor hardware wallet. 

Is this a good idea? 
Is there anything I should know? 

I have been out of the Bitcoin world for a while, so my understanding of best practices is severely lacking! ",1526060796,11/05/2018 17:46:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ippdx/how_to_claimsell_forked_coins/,1
"Bitcoin to Boom in Australia with Ban on Cash Purchase over $7,500","Australia is finally moving towards the digital society as it announces the ban on the cash purchase of over $10,000 AU from June 2019.
Australia encourages a move to the cashless &amp; digital society

The Liberal Party government of Australia recently announced that purchasing anything for over $10,000 AU i.e. $7,500 US with cash will soon become illegal. According to the government, the step has been to crack down on the tax evasion and encourage the transition to a digital society.

The ban on cash purchase over $7,500 will start on July 1, 2019. In order to enforce this directive, the government will allocate about $300 million for the Black Economy Standing Taskforce. The goal here is to make approximately $3 billion over the next four years in the new tax revenue.

Talking about Australia’s relationship with cash, about 37 percent of the commercial transactions are made with cash in the country. Whereas, Sweden only accounts for 15 percent and 32 percent in the US.

From 2019 onwards, the authorities will officially start its war on cash by implementing this measure.",1526061039,11/05/2018 17:50:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ipqxg/bitcoin_to_boom_in_australia_with_ban_on_cash/,1

Limits to Bitcoin Fungibility,"I was wondering in what ways can specific bitcoin UTXO's be made non-fungible?  Can a bitcoin wallet be programmed to refuse receipt of UTXO's sent from specific addresses?  If so, it seems extremely unlikely that enough wallets would ever be so programmed to render the blacklisted bitcoin worthless (or worth little).  

Can bitcoin miners refuse to process transactions involving specific addresses?  If so, do you think a high enough percentage of miners could ever be persuaded to blackball specific addresses to render those UTXO's worthless or worth little?  I think there will always be a group of miners who will support the ideals of Bitcoin by not blackballing  specific addresses.  

I realize that specific addresses could be invalidated with a hard fork, but that does not seem like a realistic threat to fungibility.",1526065046,11/05/2018 18:57:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iq8x4/limits_to_bitcoin_fungibility/,1

-April 2013 high of $266, to the July 2013 low of $65.42 (crash of 75%)

-Nov 2013 high of $1242, to the Jan 2015 $152 (crash of 88%)

Question about CLTV and how the dispute period is enforced,"Alice and Bob share a payment channel that has a capacity of 1 BTC.

&gt;State 1:  Bob owns 0.5 BTC. Alice owns 0.5 BTC.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-\&gt;Bob then pays 0.1 BTC to Alice.  
&gt;  
&gt;State 2: Bob owns 0.4 BTC. Alice owns 0.6 BTC.

Bob attempts to steal Alice's funds by committing state 1. I understand that the contract allows the defrauded party \( Alice\) to punish the misbehaving party \( Bob \) by claiming all its funds if she acts within a dispute period.

I also understand that the dispute period is established by placing a CLTV encumbrance on Bob's output that prevents him for spending his coins for some time, let's say 100 blocks for the sake of this example. 

**The part that I don't understand is the mechanism that Alice uses to confiscate Bob fund.** Logically there must be another encumbrance in the smart contract that lets Alice claim the coin, I would like to understand how.",1526121640,12/05/2018 10:40:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iv97f/question_about_cltv_and_how_the_dispute_period_is/,1

ADOPTION QUESTION,[removed],1526133258,12/05/2018 13:54:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iw5o2/adoption_question/,1
Why I will never Abandon Bitcoin,"I saw today that a lot of people are jumping ship and buying a fake Bitcoin run by a bunch of known scammers who sold explosives on the internet and went to jail for it, but I am not one of them.

The reason I bought Bitcoin, is because I want to be able to run a full node. With bigger blocks, it eventually becomes impossible for me to validate every transaction that happens on the network. To me, this is what decentralization means: Seeing every transaction that takes place, even though I have zero influence over it as I can't mine blocks myself.

Satoshi's plan for Bitcoin was for everyone to run a full node. This is exactly what he said on the Bitcoin forum. For this reason, he implemented the 1MB blocksize limit. In fact, 1 MB blocks are a temporary phase. I agree with Luke that we need smaller blocks. Once the lightning network is fully operational, we will no longer have to use the blockchain (which is a terrible invention anyway, as blockchains scale terribly!) for every transaction. Instead, with the lightning network fully operational, we should be able to softfork to smaller blocks, ideally of around 250 kilobyte.

To me, it doesn't really matter anymore whether the value of Bitcoin is one dollar or a million dollar. I don't care whether it loses me all my life savings and everyone else starts using a fake copy of Bitcoin. I will never betray Bitcoin and join a fake Bitcoin, as it goes against my principles.",1526133563,12/05/2018 13:59:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iw6qc/why_i_will_never_abandon_bitcoin/,1

how is the price of bitcoin determined on the exchanges,"I have been thinking about this for some time. I understand supply and demand but how can the price of bitcoin be determined without any type of human intervention or other factors. For example say goldman sachs buys 100000 btc on the otc, how does the traders at bitfinex know this has happened to reflect the high demand in coins? What i am trying to get at is there are so many variable and facts known and unknown in the world that it would be impossible for traders to be able to digest and have the price be a reflection of this.

I mean there is a finite number of coins on bitfinex, so if a whale sells 500 and a institution buys 50000 on the otc it doesnt make sense that the actual price would go down but it does because that whale at that moment in time doesnt know of the otc trades. 

what I am getting at is that the finite amount of coins on bitfinex should not determine the price of bitcoin because it is such a small sample size of what is actually going on in the world. if there is a shortage of coins nobody would ever know because the only price we can see is the price set by the finite amount of coins on the exchanges. so in other words, we will never be able to get a true price.",1526134438,12/05/2018 14:13:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iw9tu/how_is_the_price_of_bitcoin_determined_on_the/,1

"INGOT Coin Develops An All-Inclusive Ecosystem to Bridge Markets, Revives Lost Demand","Designed and developed by a world-class team of industry veterans, INGOT COIN (IC) is an all-inclusive, financial ecosystem directly linking the traditional financial market to cryptocurrency through innovative banking, exchange and brokerage infrastructures. The IC ecosystem aims to revive and restore the missing unity between both markets through six core financial structures, bringing together everyday payments under a single umbrella. The unification of these services will enable the community to capitalize on opportunities and leverage information across all markets.
“INGOT Coin will create a complete solution by integrating 6 core ecosystem components and providing a one-stop-shop for the digital asset, traditional asset, and currency markets,” explains Iman Mutlaq, Director of INGOT Group and founder of INGOT Coin.
INGOT COIN ecosystem consists of a multicurrency wallet service, a digital bank, exchange services, brokerage, certifier, and blockchain startup accelerator. With its focus on integrating two different markets on a unifying platform, users on the ecosystem will be able to seamlessly exchange values -- transferring cryptocurrencies for use in real-world activities and vice versa. The ecosystem also offers additional services.
Linking Both Worlds
INGOT COIN development is being informed by a team of certified experts. The platform will offer round the clock support to address any concern, establish services and linkage between the crypto and traditional markets, facilitate fast, secure and safe entry and exit mechanisms for these markets, provide tools for streamlining and making trading techniques and reallocation effective without the traditional hindrances associated with the previously segregated markets.
INGOT Coin CMO  outlined the potential of the ecosystem, stating:
“INGOT Coin will make trading direct, cost-efficient, less timely and more available round the clock by utilizing distributed technologies and discarding the issues brought by third-party intermediaries and banks such as high fees, unavailability, and time consumption” stated INGOT COIN CMO, Ahmed Khawanky. “Being in the market since 1993, we can see that as technology progresses, the more efficient the markets are.”
INGOT COIN ecosystem is primarily a facilitator of custodial and brokerage operations, encompassing all the required functions of traditional financial instruments. The ecosystem will facilitate the linking of multi-signature and cold storage IC Wallets through a fully-fledged Exchange and an intuitive Brokerage facility. Users will be able to securely trade cryptos, seamlessly switch to traditional markets, and expand upon or liquidate assets through the IC Bank. INGOT has also announced that it will be introducing short-selling concepts in the Middle East and North Africa.

[Discussion] Fundamental Problems of ASIC Resistant Algorithms,"We've seen the real-world use cases for ASICs many times, perhaps most notably in network switches. As switches evolved to do more intelligent processing, general purpose CPUs were not able to meet speed and energy efficiency requirements and thus, the eventual implementation of ASICs became the logical choice, as they were able to make switching decisions very quickly and much more efficiently. Over time, software-based processing via general purpose CPUs has no doubt increased greatly in both speed and efficiency, but even today, ASICs are still the logical choice when maximizing processing speed and energy efficiency.


With this in mind, I can't help but question why people are still so adamant about ASIC resistance.


I don't know if there are any algorithms in use today that are truly ASIC resistant, and even if there are, I don't think ASIC resistance is valuable property for a cryptocurrency on the layer one protocol level. The algorithms I've come across rely on complexity in order to discourage ASIC development, which in turn actually threatens decentralization since, if some entity were to eventually create an ASIC for one of these complex algorithms, no doubt other entities would have to undergo the burden of inventing an ASIC of their own. After all, we shouldn't assume that entities will freely share design blueprints. Thus, it would be an endeavour which would appear to be quite discouraging, as greater complexity would most likely translate into greater start up costs, and the fact that there would already be an ASIC manufacturer with an essential monopoly in the space would mean that new manufacturers would have to produce a product that is either adequately cheaper in price for the  consumer, or adequately more energy efficient, all while still maintaining desirable margins in order to stay afloat financially.


Of course, knowledgeable development teams would be aware of these concerns, and  would design software to allow for easy forking to different algorithms, should an ASIC ever be developed for the algorithm they were currently using. However, this not only highlights the issue of using algorithms which have never been tested outside of simulations (when applicable), but it also places the burden of consensus on the community. As we've seen, achieving consensus within a large community is not always a quick and easy process, even when the proposed changes are beneficial to the community at large. One could argue that part of the problem is that each consensus process is an opportunity for malicious actors (perhaps community members from a competing cryptocurrency) to cast their vote as well.


Details can be mulled over, but fundamentally, I believe ASIC resistance allows for more problems than ASIC acceptance.


On the other hand, algorithms that can easily be adopted for use with dedicated hardware allow for entities to manufacture ASICs with much lower start up costs in comparison to complex algorithms. As noted in the first paragraph, theoretically, ASICs allow for great processing power with less energy expense in comparison to general purpose CPUs of equal processing power. The reason that I use the word ""theoretically"" here is because in reality, ASICs are not only much more energy efficient than general purpose CPUs, but also, ASICs deliver much greater processing power than general purpose CPUs. So, even if some magical general purpose CPU that could match an ASIC in processing power existed, that CPU would still be far less efficient than the real-world ASICs we have today.


In summary, I have yet to find any strong arguments as to why ASIC resistance should be a desirable property of a cryptocurrency on the level one protocol level.",1526153011,12/05/2018 19:23:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iyaea/discussion_fundamental_problems_of_asic_resistant/,1

Cryptocurrency chaplin speech,"I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be fiat consumer. That’s not my destiny. I don’t want to be centralised or sanctioned. I should like to trade with everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by the elite’s misery. We don’t want to starve and suffer from their sanctions. In this world there is room to trade with no discrimination for everyone. And trade not affecting the bottom. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
KYC has poisoned men’s souls, has discriminated the world with regulation whom have no I.D, has goose-stepped us into greed and HODL. We have developed P2P, but we have shut ourselves in. Bilderberg enforces evil that has left us in greed. Our portfolio has made us sour. Our experience, mining and impatient. We HODL too much and educate too little. More than development we need to think of the developing. More that, we need unification we need to adopt the bottom. Without these qualities, P2P will be handed over and all will be lost….
The internet and the encryption has brought us the best privacy. The very technicality of these inventions cries out for the goodness in future of investment - cries out for universal end to discrimination - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching billions throughout the world - billions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. …..
Crypto investors! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are free! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for decentralisation!

Freewallet stole cancer patient's life savings &amp; ID,"DO NOT PUT YOUR MONEY IN FREEWALLET. ALL OF MY FUNDS AND MY ID HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

First, please do not post comments that I should not have used Freewallet. I think that's pretty obvious now. It was a huge mistake but that doesn't make what they're doing any less criminal.

I suffer from cancer, which Ive told them already, but the Freewallet scam keeps on rolling. NO honest company has the HUNDREDS of scam complaints that these thieves at [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) do. Look up their previous posts to me.

For no valid reason, Freewallet began blocking customer access to their funds recently. Every ridiculous, phony excuse has been made, none of them true.

After absolutely assuring I would have access to my crypto after a simple ID submission, Freewallet instead obstructed my access by making an absurd claim that my ID photos had been edited. That is exactly the tactic I expected from this criminal organization. As I proved to them via video, all of my photos were 100&amp;#37; legitimate, completely unedited. On top of that, EVERY other crypto exchange that Ive submitted my ID to has NEVER even questioned it. WHY? Because the other exchanges are not scams like [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) is. Again, just look at the massive number of complaints. Search them. It speaks for itself.

Their tactic is beyond predictable for a scam. When they see they've encountered their worst nightmare, meaning me in this case, they begin resolving a few complaints here and there to make it look like they're trying to do right. All of those, however, are peanuts compared to my life savings. They would rather risk their necks than let that go back to its rightful owner. That's what lowlife scammers like Freewallet do.

Theyre so careless at Freewallet, that they never thought to consider Reddit posts CANNOT be deleted. This is NOT Facebook, where they delete customer complaints ALL the time.

Nothing matters to them but stealing my life savings. I have my life savings in there. I have given them EXACTLY what they asked for, and I still have NO access to my crypto.

My emails to them are now also with the US Attorney, who is the most prolific cyber crimes prosecutor on earth. They have already stated to my personal lawyer that a company who refuses to provide their own identities and location cannot lawfully ask customers for theirs. The USA's office labeled Freewallet ""an obvious scam"" in a call with my lawyer. Im a US customer, so Freewallet must abide by US law. The US has extradited many cyber criminals who have never even set foot in the US before, just because they stole from a US customer. They have that kind of extreme influence worldwide.

At this point my cancer symptoms have grown worse due to the stress Freewallet has caused me. I can barely breathe at times. However, I certainly expect to be here long enough to have them prosecuted, via the US Attorney, and their partner, Interpol.

Perhaps their biggest problem though, is I now know who their biggest figure is, whose operation is funded by stolen Freewallet funds like mine, and until my crypto is released to me, he can expect his life to be a nightmare.

You stole from the wrong cancer patient Freewallet... and now you're going to pay",1526155634,12/05/2018 20:07:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iykkp/freewallet_stole_cancer_patients_life_savings_id/,1

We'll know soon enough is Bitcoin is being manipulated like Gold is.....,"Gold is worth way more than $1300 oz. And Bitcoin is undervalued at $8500.

Bitcoin has risen during and after Consensus each of the last three years.  Always good news, new partnerships, new press releases, no money heading into the space and announced in new York.  This year should be the best year ever for the conference and the new alliances made.

If the BTC price isn't well over $10k by the end of the month, then I'll know the price is being heavily manipulated.  the central banksters have been controlling the Gold price for decades. Gold hasn't been a free market in ages.

We'll see over the next 2\-6 weeks where Bitcoin stands as a free market investment, or has the financial elite bought it out through shorting futures.

I am optimistic because Bitcoin did rise over 30&amp;#37; last month, so we'll see.....",1526169381,12/05/2018 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8j006c/well_know_soon_enough_is_bitcoin_is_being/,1

How susceptible to market manipulation is BTC and crypto in general?,"If, for example, an individual or group, wanted to manipulate the market price of BTC, are there any measures to prevent this?

One way would be to 'shake the tree', sell a lot of BTC, forcing others to sell too out of fear, sending the price right down, only for the 'tree shaker' to buy back and increase initial stake, where others would do it too because ""...we'll never see $5000 again soon, better buy now!"" mentality kicks in, so price rises again steeply.

What are others' thoughts on this?

Situation worsened because the goverment started an operation called ""Manos de Papel"" hunting people who were trading a lot of bolivares (which the suppose come from selling USD and cryptos not using their controlled exchange rate).

Also, they took control of the biggest private bank of the country, called Banesco.

In fact, before that Localbitcoin traded the all time record of 957 BTC traded in one week.

Anyway, I added to my stack a few dollars here, a few dollars there for years when I could with each paycheck. Then last week, I stumbled upon a gambling site that every bet was on chain and I thought that idea was super cool. Meh, what’s a $5 wager goanna hurt? It didn’t. Played, won a few, lost a few bets, think I ended $10 up. No biggie and didn’t think much of it. 
Then last night… After a few drinks, felt like placing a few bets and add a satoshi or two to my holdings and decided to put down $20. Gone. Well shit, I gotta get that back, $40, gone, then $80. Sweet I won.  Then back to $40. Fuck. $80, fuck. And other shot, another bet, repeat, repeat, and repeat… holy shit! Did I just place a 2 month salary bet? WTF happened? How did I get here??? Lost. Well, I gotta win that back now.
I think you know where this is going, but I’ll tell you anyway. Yep. Gone. Everything I have been holding for 5 years. Every satoshi have bought every check. A year and a half of my mediocre salary. Much more of my net worth than care to admit as I never believed in redistributing my coins when I had so much faith. I have been known in my circle as the guy who saw the potential in BTC early, who everybody envied (for lack of a better term), and who everybody comes and asks for advice within the space. 
I’m in disbelief. Absolute disbelief. How in the world did I let this happen? When it was going on, I hardly even put a second thought into my decisions. I’m sure my drunkenness played a part, but that’s one sorry ass excuse. How could I let this happen??? I cannot wrap my head around it. Not even close to comprehending it.  I’ve have made plenty of mistakes in my life, but this has had to have been the hugest mistake of my life. The current USD value isn’t even what bothers me. I wasn’t planning on spending them anytime soon anyway. But in a year, 5 years, 10 years. How am I going to live with myself when that 100k btc rolls around within the next year or two? I don’t know that I can. Most mistakes hurt at first, but time goes on, and that mistake fades and eventually is no big deal. This mistake just going to grow and grow with each passing day. It will be twice the regret I feel now in a year. I certainly never was a cyrypto millionaire by any means. But was getting there. I could damn well buy quarter of a lambo in December. 
I can’t talk to anybody about this as nobody would ever take me seriously or trust my judgement again and not to mention embarrassing beyond belief. My dog is sick of hearing about it and I guess that’s why I’m spilling everything here. Eventually, I suppose I’m going to have to come clean that all of it is gone. How to do that? I don’t know…. I stupidly left my seed in my bill fold, lost it, and somebody moved (stole) the coins before I could? Wait until the next obscure exchange gets hacked and say I just moved everything there for a high exchange rate and saw an arbitrage opportunity?  I was trying to claim Bitcoin Private but didn’t move BTC first and the site was a fraud and stole everything? I haven’t decided which of those yet. I guess I have some time to figure that out  
Not looking for sympathy and certainly not any donations, but if anything, take my warning. Don’t be a dumbass like me. I never in a million years thought this is how I would end up parting with my coins.   Just wanted to get this off my chest. Maybe it will make me feel better. I would say I feel like shit, but that’s an understatement. As I type this, I think, is this real life? No, It couldn’t be. I check my ledger. Between the few apps, there is total of $0.44, not even enough to send anywhere if I wanted to. To say this is a lesson learned is an understatement.  Fact is, I will never have the opportunity to fuck up this bad again. I feel like absolute death. I have never experienced this feeling before.
 Amassing the amount of satoshis that I had once accumulated simply will not be possible. While it was in the single digits, it was well more than a year’s salary in value. I will always believe in bitcoin and it will be wildly successful. I know this for a fact. But to keep my sanity, this is my goodbye. I need to step away and adopt the mindset of middle aged Carol in accounting who thinks buying monopoly money is crazy. Move to a Warren Buffet and Bill Gates mindset in vain. Delete everything crypto related from my phone and computer. When hyperbitcoinization happens, I follow the crowd. I have to do it this way. Otherwise, the constant regret and reminding myself of that drunken mistake will live on constantly in my mind. So this is my goodbye bitcoin. Rock the world and do what I know you can. I’ll follow along with the ignorant masses in a year or to.

"Well, this is it. A tale of regret and more or less a diary entry. Don't be like me and learn from my mistake.","Not writing this for any kind of sympathy, but rather I guess need to talk? Lol. You don’t even have to read this, in fact, please don’t, I really don’t have much of a point here, except don’t be like me. I just need to write it out, as a diary of sorts. I have never been very active posting in the bitcoin community online and certainly not a known crypto personality, but rather huge proponent irl and browse reddit and twitter everyday to learn as much as I could. You don’t know me. My online presence in bitcoin has been anonymous. I’m no Peter McCormack, no Pomp, no Cobra, no StopandDecrypt, no (insert known bitcoin personality). Anyway. I am (was) a “crypto OG” as they say. Been holding since 2013, nearly all BTC.

Anyway, I added to my stack a few dollars here, a few dollars there for years when I could with each paycheck. Then last week, I stumbled upon a gambling site that every bet was on chain and I thought that idea was super cool. Meh, what’s a $5 wager gonna hurt? It didn’t. Played, won a few, lost a few bets, think I ended $10 up. No biggie and didn’t think much of it.

Been a while since I traded any crypto. Looking for a lightweight solution for a wallet to give as a gift.,"Hi all,

**Where I am:** after a struggle with fraud checks I managed to purchase £50 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) on Coindesk. It's about 750,000 Satoshi.

**Where I'd like to be:** Giving the Satoshi to my nephew for his 16th birthday as a wallet.dat file on a memory stick to let him figure out the rest.

**Why I'm stuck:** I visited Bitcoin.org and I was presented with several different wallet options to download. Traditionally I would have gone with Core but I see the blockchain is now 100s of Gb. I'm really looking for something lightweight and easy that I can install on a Mac and which I can transfer the wallet.dat with the Satoshi in to a USB stick to give as a gift.

Apologies if this is really basic stuff for you all now. It's been a few years since I did any trading and things (at least to me) seem to have got more complicated, not simpler.

Thanks in advance.",1526201586,13/05/2018 08:53:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8j2mfz/been_a_while_since_i_traded_any_crypto_looking/,1

Just had to use PayPal for my hosting service for the first time in years due to CoinBase and BitPay,"My hosting service has used Coinbase for years as a payment service. I've paid through this monthly with bitcoin. Easy, just scan the QR code and send my BTC.

I guess there's some shit going on with CoinBase payments so people are switching over to BitPay. As did my hosting service.

The thing is, I open up the BitPay payment channel and they have the handy option of choosing between paying with Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, along with showing what my network fee is for both (13 cents for BTC, $0 for bcash). Whatever BitPay, so I see you're accepting an alt coin for payment.

Then I scan the QR code with my wallet and get an ""invalid address"" error. So I copy the link and go to e-mail myself the BTC address so I can pay it manually.

No such luck, it's just a BitPay link, which when opened is the same invoice page.

I look through their ""how to pay"" instructions and tells me I need to use one of their pre-approved Bitcoin wallets (I'm assuming each of these wallets is probably supporting bcash, definitely not the wallet I am using). 

So they expect me to transfer my bitcoins to some other wallet just so I can pay them bitcoins? Give me the damned bitcoin address already.

So I said screw it. Went back to the hosting service and chose the PayPal payment option.

Time to look for a non-US hosting service that isn't playing these political games and uses regular old Bitcoin addresses for payment.",1526208975,13/05/2018 10:56:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8j328p/just_had_to_use_paypal_for_my_hosting_service_for/,1

This is why we already have 17 million coins in circulation and the remaining 4 million only available over the next 120 years.,"Satoshi was very smart.

He knew most new technologies usually take a minimum of 10 years to gain any real traction.

He wanted to issue as many coins as possible within the first 10 years to keep the price suppressed so as many average people as possible could obtain cheap coins during the bootstrapping phase.

What happens next is mainstream adoption and institutional demand run smack into severely reduced supply and the price explodes very quickly to a much higher ""normal"".

This was the most egalitarian way to introduce a new form of money. He honestly was also very aware of the fact that libertarians and programmers would be the first involved and would therefore become the new wealthy elite while banks and politicians tried everything to stop it, becoming less powerful in the process.

Bitcoin was ingeniously designed to transfer wealth towards libertarians, nerds and average citizens and away from corrupt incumbent politicians and financial institutions.

The power brokers are feeling some heat all due to this previously unknown crypto equation.

Ultimately it will be the people who will decide whether blockchain technology becomes the standard by which the world’s economies conduct business. The power of the vote can bring down governments, even change the existing monetary system.

With all that being said here is a one question two part survey,

Part A: Will cryptocurrencies become the standard? Yes ( ) No ( ).

Got sick of price speculation. Made an easy way to index the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.,"Hey guys.

I’ve been pretty frustrated with the speculation and baseless price predictions in the cryptocurrency market. So I took the boring, old\-school concept of indexing and applied it to cryptocurrencies.

The index tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization using a weighted\-cap indexing methodology. Each coin cannot go over 10&amp;#37; of the entire portfolio. The excess is redistributed to any of the top 20 coins under 10&amp;#37; by weighted market capitalization until the entire sum of the portfolio adds to to 100&amp;#37;.

The top 20 coins makes up \~87&amp;#37; of the cryptocurrency market. For comparison the S&amp;P 500 represents \~75&amp;#37; of the US stock market.

At first I was calculating and executing this strategy by hand. But monthly rebalancing took me forever to do and was extremely tedious. So, I made an algorithm to do it instead. It uses the Binance exchange API to facilitate these trades.

Last month, I launched a hosted version that anybody can use. It’s called [HodlBot](https://www.hodlbot.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocurrency-indexing). I’ve only shared it with a few communities and [/r/algotrading](https://np.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/8dvy93/i_made_a_algo_bot_that_indexes_into_the_top_20/) thus far.

I’ve backtested the index against 3 years of historical data and talk about it [here](https://medium.com/@AnthonytXie/hodlbot-cryptocurrency-investing-on-autopilot-dce2e4c9a7f7). *Take the backtest data with a grain of salt. The crypto market has been on fire in the last 3 years.*

In the one and a half months of live trading, the indexing strategy was up 99&amp;#37;. Performance details and transaction logs [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/8h85kp/2x_from_algorithmically_indexing_top_20/).

If you’re thinking about checking it out, I just want to pass a long one important disclaimer:

HodlBot is a long\-term, passive, low\-cost, indexing strategy. HodlBot does not actively trade, it does not try to beat the market. HodlBot only tries to capture the risk &amp; performance of the market as a whole, and lower your alpha and your unsystematic risk.

If you believe in the tech \(or just want to hedge your bets\), then indexing is a great way to bet on the market as a whole. It’ll save you the headache from trying to pick out the winners. If the history of the stock market tells us anything, most investors are really bad at beating the market.[ Over the last 15\-year period, 95&amp;#37; of active funds failed to beat index funds.](http://www.aei.org/publication/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/)

Thanks you guys for reading. I’d love it if you guys could check it out and let me know what you think.

I'll tip anyone who solves this.. nicely.,"SO... I've got an.. issue.

I had a Mycelium Android wallet in 2013. I had quite a few bitcoins on it. Of course, I printed out the PDF it creates, wrote down the 15\+1 chars it gives. Double, triple checked.

Forward to 2014. I got a new phone. I installed Mycelium, used the QR code from the PDF \(it's an encoded private key \(begins with xEnc\)\) and used the 15\+1 chars to recover the wallet to the new phone. Worked like a charm!

I did this again in 2016 with a new phone \- no problems!

Forward 2018 \(and since 2017\). I wanted to sell the bitcoins I have. I got a new phone, installed Mycelium, scanned the QR from the PDF, it asked me for the 16 chars and.... **cannot decrypt the wallet** claiming the 16 chars are wrong. 

I have no idea what to do. I'm lost.

Crypto portfolio App reviews.Agreed or disagreed?,"# Well, a few friends of mine had a conversation about current crypto portfolio apps in the market, it got me thinking about how there are plenty of alternatives and it can be a little bit confusing to those new participants.Besides, it seems there are a few main portfolio trackers and it also hard to pick a nice one to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. So I've asked some people about what app do they currently use for crypto portfolio management on reddit (thanks guys) and here's what I found.  

PS: I found a new app just came out last month, it's not bad actually ,and I really really liked the allocation feature! I wanted to share it with with you guy as well: \)  **Blockfolio**  Pros:

1. Blockfolio was the first crypto app I downloaded, unlike the most of free apps in market, the interface of Blockfolio is not congested with aggressive advertisements at all, and it has no ads, very clean interface.
2. I'm not a day trader, but still I liked the price notification a lot.I would know what is happening to my portfolios at all times by setting alerts at certain dollar amount.
3. The charts are really insightful on Blockfolio, and it also very easy to understand, totally better than Delta at this point.

Cons:      

1. I was having some server issues with Blockfolio is that COSS exchange not working on its app, and I couldn't see my overall profits...they might have improved it, I am not sure.
2. Another issue is that it didn't alert me a couple of times, which made me lose out on some important events.Obviously, this feature is not very optimal.
3. All portfolio information on Blockfolio must be inputed manually, it is very annoying to those people who have a number of holdings which include me.
4. Trading pairs can be limited sometimes, I saw people complained about this before,and it occurred to me as well.for example, some coins only show BTC &amp; fiat pairs.

no need to add a link, I'm pretty sure you can find it easily**Coinbox**  It is a new crypto portfolio app I found on YouTube\([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rft93oKjo8k&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rft93oKjo8k&amp;feature=youtu.be)\), obviously it's still on its early stage/version, but I liked it coz it is doing great as a new app.  Pros:

1. Just like I mentioned above, Coinbox got a pie area that shows you allocations of your portfolios which is pretty cool. It tells you the percentage of each investment on different coins. 
2. It also got a location pie chart which present you percentage of you portfolios on each exchange, once you put everything together, it will up to date.
3. Just like what's Delta doing, with Coinbox you could actually import the APIs of the exchanges that you trade with, and this app is supposed to actually to automatically keep track of the coins that you are trading.
4. Coinbox supports multiple coins at no cost, yes, it is completely free! as a new app so far so good.
5. You can see what happened to your portfolio in the last 24 hours, it is nice to see how much you lost/gained in one day.
6. It has a very simple design and easy navigation with one click to different tools and areas\(3 tabs only\)
7. Nice and clean interface, I think it is available on both Google play and Apple store.

Cons:

1. Only two Language options: English and Chinese, it might be enough, but it is no harm to add a couple of more.
2. It definitely needs to add more exchanges, I think the team has been working on it according to the coinbox introduction video I watched.
3. Some details need to be improved, but overall it is pretty cool, I sent an email to Coinbox team to give them my reviews, I would appreciate their openness.

**Delta**   Pros

1. Delta is amazing I gotta say, I switched over from Blockfolio to Delta a couple months ago, and I know a lot of people do that too!Firstly, Delta got nice\-designed and friendly interface, better than any of the apps for me.
2. Delta also offers importing transactions automatically from exchanges which is great for any traders. It also has a watchlist which means you can add more portfolios and have a separated list.
3. Delta has supported a large range of coins\(With2000\+\), I believe that not everyone sticks to top 50 coins\(my friends are not\), so Delta might help more investor to be adventurous.
4. It is not only available on Google play and Apple store, but also available on desktop!

Cons

1. Delta is really good app in the market, but it is not completely free though.
2. Again, the features on free version are limited, I have to pay it a monthly fee for more.
3. The interface style is might not for anyone, a friend of mine like Blockfolio&amp;BitUniverse more.

There are plenty of crypto app options out there, it totally depends on your needs. These reviews is just a starting point to help you on your way to finding the right one for you. For me, I would have Delta and Coinbox on my phone, Delta is good enough obviously, but I would also like to see a new app grow.   These opinions are my own and I'd like to hear if you agree/disagree. Or your views on other apps.

Bitcoin Blacklisted: Why You Should Ditch Medium.com,"Hey everyone,

My name is Malcolm and I've been writing about Bitcoin and other various cryptocurrencies for some time now. I chose to host my content on Medium.com. Unfortunately, it seems like they are very hostile to crypto; indeed, crypto-related accounts on this platform have been vanishing left and right for totally frivolous reasons (hi, /u/Jarunik !). 

Well, it finally happened to me. They didn't give me any warning so I could move my work elsewhere or resolve whatever TOS issue they had with my content. They didn't even bother to let me know that I had been ""suspended"" - or really, blacklisted/deleted. Indeed, as long as I was logged into my account it looked like my articles were still online! On top of this, once I figured out what was going on, they wouldn't even tell me what rule they thought I violated. Crazy, right?

Well, my understanding is that the community likes to keep abreast of banks, companies, platforms, and so on that are hostile to cryptocurrency. My opinion is that Medium is one of these companies. Thankfully, I am a computer scientist, so I was able to quickly spool up my own site. This is the first article I've written since the changeover, and I hope you find it interesting. Without further ado, I give you:

Microsoft + Bitcoin Lightning Network. Decentralized Identity proof of concept to be shown off at Consensus 2018. Seems big,"I'm not sure why this is flying under the radar. This seems extremely bullish for bitcoin.

At the Consensus event - Wednsay 16th at 9:10am Microsoft will be presenting the following:

""DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY FOR A DECENTRALIZED WORLD

Empower users to own and control their Identity. In this session Microsoft, along with Sovrin, Blockstack and uPort will share why we need Decentralized Identity. We will share proof of concept from first set of proposed standards and challenges ahead with a decentralized identity experience for everyone and everything.""

The idea behind this is for people to own their own identity information rather than having corporations holding your details and having to verify every user. This is an extremely big industry and costs user and corporations heaps in security, verification processes, customer service etc..

I believe this is going to be built [primarily] on the bitcoin lightning network. Microsoft have already released the following:

""To support a vast world of users, organizations, and devices, the underlying technology must be capable of scale and performance on par with traditional systems. Some public blockchains (Bitcoin [BTC], [E TH], [L TC], to name a select few) provide a solid foundation for rooting DIDs, recording DPKI operations, and anchoring attestations. While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale. To overcome these technical barriers, we are collaborating on decentralized Layer 2 protocols that run atop these public blockchains to achieve global scale, while preserving the attributes of a world class DID system.""

Source: https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/02/12/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we-see-it/

Clearly bitcoin is way ahead with second layer solutions (lightning network) and will therefore be the strongest candidate to run this system.

Verifying this, the lead microsoft developer, Daniel Buchner, tweeted this morning;

""I was intro'd to Bitcoin in early 2011 by a good friend at Mozilla. That year I started working on a proposal called Firefox Handshake, a vision for decentralized apps/comms based on Bitcoin-anchored decentralized IDs

Now, in May 2018, we're at the tipping point of inevitability""

source: https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/995796810827517952

When Microsoft releases this on the bitcoin network it will boost community and institutional confidence that bitcoin is still the leader in crypto development and has the strongest and most distributed blockchain.

Daniel's tweet hints that this system is close to being released",1526262309,14/05/2018 01:45:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8j8pd0/microsoft_bitcoin_lightning_network_decentralized/,1

"[Serious] bitcoin hack??????******* out of my element here, I'll do my best to explain*******","\[Serious\] just got out of a year and half long abusive relationship with a vile, morally reprehensible monster. no details unless asked. it started as verbal and emotional abuse, calling me names and insults here and there about my personal appearance, my friends, etc. 

he got fired from his analyst job because he has a quick temper, the many physical beatings I endured when he was under the influence of alcohol are proof of that. when he lost his job he decided that staying home was better so he could watch my every move. all he did all day was be on his computer trading Bitcoin \(forgive my incorrect terminology of the subject, I am not familiar as stated\). 

I lost my job, had to drop out of school, I'm only 26 and he ruined so much of my life. for those of you that don't understand and only wish to send me hate, there is nothing that could ever compare to the pain he caused me. 

my left shin permanently lost all feeling from being thrown to the ground only to smash against my leg against a wooden end table that damaged my circulation. his apartment has two holes in the walls when he missed my stomach, and one hole he kicked into a door after he was finished with me. 

I want to hurt him back and a friend mentioned that you can hack peoples ""blockchain"" \(again, terminology?\) 

I do not know anything about this cryptocurrency world, if it really is even money, but I want him to lose everything and this is the only thing I know of that I can do from a different state. 

I want him to suffer and taking away everything he owns is barely a start to everything he took away from me. am I a bad person for wanting revenge? I'll face my judgement with God, no one else. 

the majority of you may find fueling my personal vendetta against the monster of a human that beat, insulted, and humiliated me to be immoral. 

all I need is one of you who knows how to take him down with no ties whatsoever to me. I escaped and moved back in with my mom and he knows where she lives, hes threatened me multiple times and if he ever found out I was tied to this I would be dead. if there is anyone out there who can help.

Why should I invest? And is this just a time bomb?",,1526273904,14/05/2018 04:58:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8j9rva/seriously_why_do_you_think_bitcoin_is_anything/,1
Is it possible to hack the transaction?,"Let's a assume account A create a simple one input and one output transaction.
input: 
    amount: 1.2 bicoin
    location to consume: transaction abccdef with index 1
    unlock script: Announce it is the right person to spend
output:
  amount: 1.1 bicoin
  lock script: give the target account public key ,for example B

Once the transaction is sent out and before confirm into block chain, hacker could create a fake transaction with same input and amend the output lock script to his own account (on the other word, change B to C) and send out the trasaction. It can also change the  output amount to i to increase the possibility of processing,

Once the fake transaction is processed, the coin is transfered from A to C!

How many people actually made thousands % in crypto?,"Crypto's biggest sales pitch is that the price was below or a few cents in the begining and the price nowadays is thousands and with this logic price would reach millions $ soon which is total BS if you understand basic economy, math and crypto.  
My question is how many people actually bought crypto for a few cents and sold it at $20k? I've heard that the most early adopters sold everything way below $100. A lot of people then bought at $100-$500 range and not many sold at $1000. Crash happened then 4 years later price reached $1000 again, then after a few months a lot of people bought at $10k+ and not many sold at $17k+ 
Not that much of a gain if you consider that most of the people probably cut their losses and got out at some point.

To get filthy rich just by holding bitcoin and doing nothing? -Bullseye.


We all are all stuffed in this “get rich quick” scheme. And there is no easy way to get rich, and no way it can happen overnight. Yes, it happened in 2017. but is was so uncalled, unexpected and no planed. Now we all hope we can see 1m$ bitcoin next few years and we chase it. And there are people who know what we plan to do. And they won’t let us do that. 800k redditors here on this sub. You think we can all become rich if hold? No fucking way.

There is no moon. You need to seek for new things to invest money. To late for cryptocurrency.

Why should you invest in Unify Cryptocurrency right at this moment?,"Unify is here for almost a year now. I was there with them right since the start. What I can say about them is that they're determined to turn this project into a big success. The team have had many problems, including shortage of finances, personal losses, &amp; much more in those 12 months. However, they overcame all of it and stayed there with us.

Many people were starting to loose the hope once founder told that it's going to cost him 50K USD to develop a marketplace and that he doesn't have that kind of money. Everyone were turning their heads and selling their coins... But! The founder have found other ways to do it by himself and started delivering upcoming marketplace's previews. He also have found a team member who is helping him with all that development stuff right there in the community. This proved that Unify's community is one of the greatest communities out there once again! As far as I'm aware \- almost all of the team is formed from community members. What started as 1 man's possible ""shitcoin"" with no future vision is now one of the most legitimate coins in which I've invested my money.

What are the other reasons for it's price to grow?

\* There's upcoming [BlockBid.io](https://blockbid.io/) listing. [BlockBid.io](https://blockbid.io/) seems to be a really good exchange \(unlimited deposits &amp; withdrawals, insured &amp; so on\).

\* NovaExchange which previously was Unify's main volume maker is coming back in weeks too.

\* ""Unify Marketplace"" is in development and it may see the light soon.

\* Price is \~$0.04 at this moment, which I think is ridiculously low when you know that this is a low\-supply \(\~19M\), low reward \(1 UNIFY per block\), POS only coin with active team. Also it's ATH was $0.675, so there's really a big chance that it will go back to that which would be almost 1700&amp;#37; ROI.

\* Imagine if this coin gets listed on some bigger exchange with higher volumes. For example Binance. And it can go there. :\)

Invest now &amp; thank me in a year! :\)",1526296961,14/05/2018 11:22:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jbguy/why_should_you_invest_in_unify_cryptocurrency/,1
Winklevoss twins on the Value of Bitcoin,"When you look at a company’s stock price in relation to Bitcoin, if they produce X amount of units in one year and the same amount of units in the following year, and this stock price increases as well as the economic doubling and the economic productivity hasn't changed the company’s cash flows then we would conclude that that particular company is overvalued but bitcoin is not a company, it is a network.

And the value of networks is Metcalfe's law, it's N squared so the amount of users on a network is n and so if for example I'm the only person in the world who has a phone then it's not considered very valuable. I can't call you but if you buy a phone you've actually increased the value of my phone inadvertently without even knowing because now all of a sudden my phone is rendered useful. The same thing applies with social networking, if you look at Facebook the first person on Facebook won’t have much content to look at, whereas once you connect with 100 people you can then start to share their stories and pictures etc.

So it's classic network effects; there are a billion people on Facebook which equates to a billion squared and if all of a sudden the value gets exponentially greater then that's how we value Bitcoin money, it is a network which people believe in. The U.S dollar has the most value, people believe in Bitcoin therefore it has value, people believe in gold which also has value and that's not a linear increase, by definition the more people they get to believe in Bitcoin then the more valuable it is considered, and when we look at equities or stock bubble type frameworks, in comparison to Bitcoin it's really misguided as it's a network.

Will Bitcoin reach 20+k?,"First of all I don't want to spread FUD or anything, I trust Bitcoin, 90% of my money is in Bitcoin and I'm not a pro trader I just hodl, I just want to share my shower thoughts this morning and see if I can figure this out. 

I wonder since Bitcoin hit almost 20k in december we have seen these price drops meaning some people is losing money, maybe newcomers to Bitcoin who buy at any price then sell low because of fear, whatever, but some people is indeed losing money, for the price to be at almost 20k in december lots of people lost money, and big time.  

So, yeah I have seen graphs and everything saying Bitcoin will reach 100k but those are just math based studies you cannot put math on the market, you cannot predict the market you can just make some math I could do that too, but you don't have as a variable how likely I am to buy bitcoin above 12k, after december for example, personally I would think twice to buy above 12k and I'm sure a lot of people too. 

You can argue and say, Bitcoin has dropped like that before and recovered, yeah graphically or as a percentile it has, but we're talking about 10+k drops, that's a lot of money personally if I would have invested in december I wouldn't hesitate to sell when I get a good deal and I will surely not invest in those peaks again.
  
So, how exactly you think the market will rise to the moon guys? You think people will follow the hype and buy like crazy again? You think the market will slowly grow? ",1526297125,14/05/2018 11:25:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jbhcx/will_bitcoin_reach_20k/,1

"How to respond to someone who disregards bitcoin by saying ""governments will make it illegal"".","Three points: Regulartory arbitrage, rule of law and black markets.

1) A blanket ban will most likely never happen on a global basis due to regulatory arbitrage. For every country that blanket bans crypto there will be an equal and opposite country that sees this as an opportunity for economic growth in the form of more businesses and tax revenue.

2) A blanket ban will most likely never happen on a global basis due to rule of law. Countries will strong rule of law can not justify outlawing mutal trade between individuals if there is no harm being caused to others in the process. I.e. private barter (exchanging bitcoin for a good or service) is an action protected by a countries court of law separate from government.

minor annoyance with bitcoin qt node,"I just wanted to share a mini rant and maybe learn more about why this happened. 

I had bitcoin qt installed on a linux machine. I had a symlink to my 'blocks' directory on an external harddrive. I was successfully able to take this harddrive (with blocks), plug it into a different linux machine with bitcoin qt and run it without having to resync the blocks (symlink). 

I hadnt run it in a few months and installed bitcoin qt on yet another linux machine, plugged in the harddrive, made the symlink to my 'blocks' folder... yet bitcoin qt had problems. 

I found out its because the 'chaindata' directory changed places in one of the bitcoin qt updates and is now in 'index' inside blocks directory. I tried copying chaindata files into index but was unsuccessful. I had trouble resolving this and ended up just resyncing the whole thing.  

How can I avoid this in the future? If I had updated the OG bitcoin qt from a few months back, would it have moved the directory for me? I briefly checked bitcoin qt -help but didnt see any obvious command line options to help me. Would this been easy to fix with bitcoin cli?

TLDR: bitcoin qt on linux machine with blocks on external drive (symlink). Update on bitcoin qt moved blocks directory and ended up resyncing all blocks. ",1526307751,14/05/2018 14:22:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jcmrp/minor_annoyance_with_bitcoin_qt_node/,1

Found an old Bitcoin QT Wallet. Transactions suggested left over BTC [QUESTION],"Hello everyone,
So I've discovered an old Bitcoin QT wallet and followed the steps in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a08MlPSSULU).

Basically the steps were to replace the old wallet.dat with my backup .dat and use CMD rescan.

I'm still downloading the Blockchain (which is going to take ages). My question is, should available Bitcoins be updated straight away launching QT (before the blockchain finishes downloading)?

Currently the total is 0.0000000BTC available. What's interesting is that I can already see all the transactions and comparing in/out it looks like I should have some BTC left over. Do I just have to let the entire blockchain download before available BTC is refreshed?

Trying to see both sides of the scaling debate,"Hi there,

I am going to post this to both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc, for fairness. You may or may not be aware that I have a little podcast where I interview people in the Crypto and Bitcoin space.

My little place in the community is as someone who is not the most technically proficient but trying desperately to understand scaling. I know that from my community, there are many like me.

One thing most of us can agree on, is that we want Cryptocurrencies to grow, and be successful, therefore we want more people to join, buy coins and spend them. We also encourage people to do their research and understand what they are investing in.

As a non-technical person coming into the space, it is very hard to try and find an impartial view on the Bitcoin scaling debate. There are two very passionate camps who appear to have very passionate views on how Bitcoin should be scaled but the tribalism is scary. I have been sucked into this myself at times.

From my experience of this, I have met various people from both camps. So far I have interviewed Jameson Lopp, Charlie Lee, Roger Ver and Craig Wright. Despite the opinions people have on who I choose to interview, I try to be fair and have both sides. Also, I am not perfect, interviewing is something I am learning and new to.

An awful lot of work goes into preparing each interview, trying to research as much as I can, so I can try and see the points of view and look for gaps for which I can question. Handling each interview is difficult to, especially trying to manage a discussion, get people to answer tough questions, accept that an interview might move into an unexpected area which I don't have the knowledge of, listen to and respond to the interviewee, while also keep to my own question structure. Trust me, it is much harder than you think, especially when you are up against experienced people, if you don't believe me, try it.

In the last week alone I have interviewed a journalist from South America, and thus have been researching the history of Venezuela and socliasm, I have interviewed Roger Ver and Samson Mow, so I have tried to understand the full history of the scaling debate and the current technologies being worked on. I have flown to Japan and back, into England to spend a day with my children and then out to New York. I am not looking for sympathy, I just want people to be aware of what goes into all this.

I am trying to become more impartial but I will make mistakes and I will make judgements. There are many smart and clever people who have the debate and get into quite good technical detail, there are also many people like me who want things to be a bit simpler and want an impartial view.

When a new investor goes onto Coinbase, they will see two Bitcoin's. If they want to research which to buy, they can be met with a wall of propaganda, hate and accusations. This is very difficult to navigate and I am yet to find a solid impartial breakdown of the two.

From both sides of the debate, I have received abuse, false accusations, insults, heavy criticism of everything from my technical knowledge to my ability.

There has also been intimidation and threats.

Everything which has happened has come from both sides of the debate and from people in both camps.

Yesterday when asking questions about Lightning Network I was told that Roger had got into my head and I was becoming a big blocker. Another person sent me a DM, relentlessly arguing with me, even though I explained I was busy preparing an interview, then told me I am a small blocker idiot. This doesn't help anyone.

My own view is that I can see positives and negatives from both sides and I am happy to explore this. There are really smart people working on both sides of the scaling argument, people I respect.

I will continue to do what I do, whatever people say to me. What I do hope is that people can try and slow down a little, try and talk rather than aggressively pursue their own narrative.

What the scaling debate appears to me is different philosophical, technical and economic views on what should happen and how it should be scaled. If you have a different opinion, that is what it is, a different opinion. All others arguments and accusations which come alongside this are just wrapping the opinion.

Neither BTC or BCH are going away. It is a live split test and nobody can say with 100% absolute certainty, how this will play out. Both exist today, both will likely exist in a year, both will likely exist in 3 years but as time goes on each will face new challenges.

My hope is that both camps now just focus on themselves, focus on their approach and work on their solution. My expectation though is that it won't, the endless infighting, accusations, counter-accusations, abuse and trolling will continue.

I will do what I do and I appreciate those who have not been abusive and have been thankful and supportive to what I am doing.

Good luck, happy to answer any non-abusive questions.

Peter PS I currently mine and own both BTC and BCH but am considering selling all of both to remain as neutral as possible.",1526312788,14/05/2018 15:46:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jdau0/trying_to_see_both_sides_of_the_scaling_debate/,1

To better understand people's point of view and to better explain my point, I wanted to make a new post specifically for it. 

**1st \(clarification\):** I obviously wasn't the first person to make this claim. I believe I first heard either Max Keiser or Tone Vays mention it and when you Google unconfiscatable or non\-confiscatable Bitcoin, you'll find many others claiming this to be true. That ins't to say I'm right because others share the same viewpoint. AND I'm also not speaking for them and saying this is their same argument \(I can't even find their arguments to this claim actually!\). I'm just putting it out there that people who understand Bitcoin's protocol much better than I do have made this same claim. I got the feeling on yesterday's post that some people had never heard this before and thought some random person on Reddit was making this claim.

**2nd \(the claim\):** If stored in a certain way, Bitcoins cannot be confiscated. 

**3rd \(the reason\):** On one hand, while someone can confiscate your Bitcoins by raiding an exchange and forcing them to transfer all the coins to their own wallets or coming into your house and taking your hardware or paper wallets, or actually taking physical Bitcoins created by a company like Casascius. On the other hand, there is also a way that Bitcoins cannot be confiscated. For example, if I store the private key to my Bitcoins in my brain wallet, they cannot be confiscated. 

**4th \(final thoughts\)**: So by saying that Bitcoins are non\-confiscatable isn't to say they can't be confiscated. The point is they have the ability to be stored in a way that makes them non\-confiscatable. Which is unique to other currencies and things that store value. Regardless of the percentage of people who actually have the balls to store their private key in their memory, doesn't change the fact that the properties of Bitcoin allow it to be unconfiscatable if desired.

**5th \(where do you stand on this matter?\):** I'm interested in hearing all of your thoughts and counter arguments to the above claim. Also, let me know if there are other reasons why it's non\-confiscatable.

Acceptance of Bitcoin is kind of stalling,"While still a risky situation to do so, due to a number of factors, it may be advisable for users of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to start signalling that they accept bitcoin for transactions. In other words, individuals simply stating (kind of like a signature block on any posts you make) that they accept crypto.

Since the big entities simply are too risk-averse to attempt it for the most part at the moment (due mainly to bitcoin's extreme--though decreasing--volatility), the job rests on us, the little guys, to get the ball rolling a bit faster.

Do any of you (do many of you?) accept bitcoin for transactions?

The utility of a currency as a means of transaction is only as great as those who actually use it for transactions. Big companies like amazon operate on very thin profit margins usually, and thus cannot handle a currency that may lose 20% of its value over a couple days. We, however, can, and therefore are far freer than such large entities.

The best solution, as it always has been (especially for true believers), is to transact and replenish. That is, use bitcoin to transact with others, and then immediately buy bitcoin back for your fiat. It's a net plus-plus. You're getting bitcoin to someone else, spreading use, and taking more off the market by using fiat that you no longer need to use for other transactions (because you already used currency to buy that thing--bitcoin). This increases network effect, and tightens supply, increasing the price by an ever-so-small amount.

When 10 people do this, you might see the price go up 0.00001 cent. When 10,000 people do it, you might see it go up 1-2 cents (yes, not one-to-one, because a price increase would be exponential in this case). If 1 million people do it, you may see the price go up a few hundred USD.

Just some of my thoughts. Much of this is re-iteration, but understand, there is virtue in repetition. This is especially true in such a large subreddit with thousands of new users coming in every day.

All of this being said, I accept bitcoin for transactions.",1526317606,14/05/2018 17:06:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jdybz/acceptance_of_bitcoin_is_kind_of_stalling/,1

Community Alert! Do not trust Overstock.com with crypto payments!,"Last week, I bought a $20 polo shirt from their site with Bitcoin just to show my enthusiastic support that they accept crypto. This morning I received an email from them telling me my order has been successfully cancelled. I called their Loss Prevention line to tell them I didn't cancel my order. The customer service rep said they didn't receive my money (even though my wallet shows 416 confirmations). I also don't see my refund in my bitcoin wallet (even though they said they completed that refund back to me).

They put customer service rep ""Page"" on the phone with me. She said the staff there made a (verbally spoken?) mistake, whereby one staffer told another one that my payment was not received so they prompted the order cancellation on their end. But Page sees now that they did in fact receive my money. Wait; this gets worse.

They apparently don't correctly use the bitcoin payment protocol. That protocol provides them a return address to send a refund to a customer should they choose to conduct a refund. But instead, Page told me I can recover my money at Coinbase with my Coinbase account. I told her I didn't use Coinbase to buy anything and I don't even have a Coinbase account. She said I'll have to open a Coinbase account then so as to begin the process of recovering my bitcoin refund from Overstock.com.

I reminded this Overstock.com customer-facing representative that I did not cancel the order. I do not want to open a Coinbase account to get my Overstock refund due to a mistake introduced by Overstock staff. If saying I'm the victim is too harsh a word, okay, I am the inconvenienced customer that did my part of the transaction and that Overstock failed to do see through on their part of the same transaction. I asked Page to take more ownership of the problem than to send the customer on a journey through Coinbase’s customer service channels which is notoriously bad. I told her to involve leadership at Overstock.com if necessary, and to show a good faith effort on their part to make this right. Not this dismissive reply for the customer to embark on an expedition through Coinbase for my precious crypto. 

The customer service agent was curt, basically telling me in a monotone voice that Overstock.com will not take accountability for their mistake and ship me the shirt while chasing down the payment they erroneously sent away to Coinbase. Even when I warned her the harm to Overstock.com’s reputation this will cause when I tell my story to the crypto-currency communities, Page seems to believe the financial cost of a brand that can’t be trusted is not as expensive as eating the cost of just $20 dollars to send me the shirt she concedes I did pay for.

I reasserted to her my prerogative that I should not open a new account with another company that I don’t want to do business with to recover my money from a transaction mishap done by Overstock.com. She said she’ll try to get the money back from Coinbase themselves instead of putting this work on me. She said, and I quote, “It’s a 50/50 chance we’ll get that money back from Coinbase we sent them”. She said it may take a couple of business days before they have any news for me whether they could do it and, if successful, it may be over a week before I get either my money back or get that polo shirt I paid for.

What a pain in the ass! Hey, Overstock.com Patrick M. Byrne, are you seeing this?!? Surely you care more than Page about your staff damaging your business’s brand reputation, right? Make this right. If you do, I’ll circle back here and let everyone in this community know that you stepped in and expedited quality customer care.

A Question About SPV's and Ultimately Transacting In-Person,"I'm trying to understand SPV's better. If I initiate a transaction and then use my SPV wallet to check it, does the SPV check blocks that have yet to verified? Or would I have to wait (potentially hours/days based on mem pool clogging) for whatever block my transaction ended up in to finally be verified and then for my SPV wallet to find it.

The bigger question I'm curious about is about buying/selling in-person. If I'm paying someone in cash, or getting paid in cash (let's say at a Starbucks), how much trust can we have at the moment of the transaction that our transaction is legitimate?

Bitcoin Long-term Price Analysis,"BTCUSD Long-term Trend – Bearish

Distribution territories: $11,000.00, $12,000.00, $13,000.00.

Accumulation territories: $7,000.00, $6,000.00, $5,000.00.

Bitcoin has been consecutively witnessing bearish movements against the US dollar since the beginning of this week. Between May 5 and 6, the bulls were close to the distribution territory of $10,000.00 but were being slightly weakened, and the bears eventually took over. The 13-day SMA is still above the 50-day SMA.

Bitcoin’s price is currently trending southward towards the 50-day SMA within the distribution territory of $10,000.00 and the accumulation distribution territory of $8,000.00.

The Stochastic Oscillators have crossed and moved a bit southward past range 50. They are seemingly gathering momentum around said range. Expectations may see the current bearish movement lure traders into entering fake selling orders that will only last for a while.

The bulls can be believed to have started building up the required catalyst from the markets current downtrend. The sentiment as to what investors are expected to do show us they can continue to enter long trades from bearish reversal trends. Traders can also look out for the same reversal format and take long entries by applying good money management rules",1526321338,14/05/2018 18:08:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jegcc/bitcoin_longterm_price_analysis/,1

Bank of America closed my account.,My account was frozen and closed along with my mother’s account because she was linked to mine. They gave no explanation as to why they have closed our accounts and apparently don’t have to because of the agreement you sign when opening a bank account. I have only used my bank account to receive deposits from Coinbase and never once made a purchase with my account. I don’t understand why they have done this considering I’ve paid all my taxes for what I’ve withdrawn. This situation could mess up so many peoples lives when they got bills to pay and the banks says they will mail you a check a week later. Luckily enough I still hold some bitcoin so I was able to get cash to pay the mortgage and for food.,1526337337,14/05/2018 22:35:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jgjj7/bank_of_america_closed_my_account/,1

"Major update on Freewallet scam - funds/ID stolen, need help from ALL of you","Im sure you all know my previous posts. This is long but PLEASE read the whole thing, and then help me destroy Freewallet by reposting this everywhere and providing supportive comments. Remember to include the tag [u/freewallet\_support](https://www.reddit.com/u/freewallet_support) in all of your posts and comments or they wont see it.

You all know [u/freewallet\_support](https://www.reddit.com/u/freewallet_support) is a scam, who is now preventing me from paying my medical bills, but I want to show you proof of how they cannot even keep their own story straight. They froze access to my holdings last week out of the blue. They then posted this after I complained:

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

*Our security department is monitoring all activities on our platform. Our goal is to stay safe and reliable, ensuring the security of every transaction made.*

*There was suspicious activity detected on* [*/u/mxgmxg*](https://www.reddit.com/u/mxgmxg)*'s account. To be sure that nobody has unauthorized access to our customer's account, we initiated the user verification procedure.* [*/u/mxgmxg*](https://www.reddit.com/u/mxgmxg) *was requested to provide additional information to prove that he's the account owner and a real person. That's a standard KYC/AML routine quite typical for the industry.* ***Upon learning about*** [\*\*\*/u/mxgmxg\*\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/u/mxgmxg)\*\*\*'s health condition, we offered to expedite the user verification procedure specially in his case.\*\*\*

*Unfortunately, as of now,* [*/u/mxgmxg*](https://www.reddit.com/u/mxgmxg) *haven't provided any of the information required to move on with the process. Moreover, he's claiming that there's a certain condition upon which any company, no matter if it's under the US jurisdiction, must reveal not only their business details, but also the personal information on their management and employees. \(FYI, our business credentials are publicly available on our website.\)*

[*/u/mxgmxg*](https://www.reddit.com/u/mxgmxg)*,* ***as soon as you complete the user verification procedure, you will be able to resume the operations on your Freewallet account***\*. Please note that have no intention to keep your funds, on the contrary: our mission is to make sure the funds in the account are at the account owner's disposal only.\*

*Per our communication, we're ready to re\-establish the operations on your account* ***as soon as you provide the information that will allow to identify you as the account owner. That's one and only condition***\*, and we're only waiting for you to proceed. Just to remind you, quite a number of Freewallet customers have already passed the user verification procedure and continued their cryptocurrency operations.\*

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Look carefully above. They clearly state the words **""ONE AND ONLY CONDITION""** as it pertains to my providing the info requested by them.

But what info? Well, that message was followed by this one, explaining the user verification procedure mentioned by them above:

*Dear customer,*

*Our security department is monitoring all activities on our platform. Our goal is to stay safe and reliable, ensuring the security of every transaction made.*

*Pursuant to the internal policy on the customer identification process, we kindly ask you to provide us with the following:*

***\- A clear closeup photo of your identification document \(a national ID or a driver’s licence\) being held in your hand. Scanned images are not accepted;***

***\- A photo of yourself settled near your computer monitor with this ticket viewed on the screen. You should be easily identified on the photo, and this exact text should be clearly seen.***

***\- A photo of yourself in front of the image ""Attention"" \(attached below\) on your computer monitor \(if you use the web version of Freewallet\) or near your mobile device with your app being open so that we were able to see your user ID.***

*Best regards,*

*Freewallet Support Team*

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

As you can see, **all they are asking for is photo ID**, which I didnt want to give, and doubted they were being honest, but I did anyway in order to hopefully get this resolved. I am desperate to access my funds for my medical expenses

NOWHERE does it say that transaction info would be needed, ONLY photos. Period

They acknowledged receiving my photos and I even included a video proving my ID was genuine

**Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, they send me this:**

*Dear customer,*

*We have detected suspicious activity on your account. To be sure that nobody has unauthorized access to our customer's account, please provide us with screenshots showing the source some of your incoming transactions:*

*dcb2247579921d25882604fc126f4f5dabfdd9f08a838fd80e90181e2dbbcfd7\*\*911c49fcd230921d0030212dd6e2ac5b6ff900e7b04e206b46dcd2ba9e28b22b*

*\(****not from a blockchain explorer or Freewallet****\). For example, you can provide screenshots from other wallets where the coins sent to your Freewallet address came from. We should also* ***see a hashes on screenshots***\*.\*

*Rest assured, your funds are safe.*

*Best regards,*

*Freewallet Support Team*

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Just unbelievable, this lowlife scum. The scam is clear right here. It is NOT possible to provide transaction detail via screenshots etc., on Shapeshift transactions, which all of my deposits were. It is an anonymous coin exchange that we've all used, it is NOT a wallet. NOBODY has their Shapeshift records because **there are no records**. Freewallet KNOWS THIS, and knows most deposits of this coin come from Shapeshift as there was nowhere else to get it easily at that time, at least not that I was aware of.

Because they only asked for ID, and then took my ID without giving my money back, this under US law is officially **identity theft, which is confirmed by my lawyer.**

I am becoming desperately ill from my cancer because of Freewallet. The stress is killing me.

**I need everyone here to smash them with the biggest hammers you have. Repost this, post anew, comment, contact law enforcement, contact Google and Apple for offering their scam app, etc etc.**

We now have all the proof we need. No more accusations are needed, or arguing back and forth with them. They are a scam and I must get my money back. All of us scammed need it back.

If I cant get this money back Im in major trouble. It was my fault for putting my funds with them, but that doesnt change the fact that theyre criminals.",1526340790,14/05/2018 23:33:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jgxfd/major_update_on_freewallet_scam_fundsid_stolen/,1

Anyways, want to start becoming part of the community and thought I'd share one of my recent Medium articles explaining a bit about myself, where I've gone (for those of you wondering) and my plans for the future in the Cryptocurrency community.

PSA: Square’s Cash App allows Buying and Selling of BTC and it’s a lot faster than Coinbase.,"So I decided to give Square’s Cash App a shot and I am really impressed. Cash is added to the App using a Debit card which is credited instantly (and can be used immediately). And Bitcoin is credited to your account immediately upon purchase. I haven’t tried a withdrawal yet though. 

The other benefit over Coinbase is there is no fee to buy so you end up with more Bitcoin. 

Definitely worth a look for anyone looking to get away from Coinbase.

Technology is not an obstacle to prosperity and freedom, it alone and not creates, but man. He is wondering whether the technology will be used in a positive or negative direction.

Today's largest global battle in the world of **Cryptocurrency** is what will be the first **crypto** value to be found on official world stock exchanges and that will allow the greatest possible accessibility and the way of using the ""ordinary"" man.

Bitcoin Debit cards for withdrawing money to live on (around the world). What do you use?,"Hi,

I'm aware there is a lot of information out there, but I'm currently overwhelmed by the number of options and it's hard to sift through what works and what doesn't. Basically I want to live off of my bitcoin, so will just be putting small amounts onto a prepaid card \(or using a card that can withdraw directly from my bitcoin on the spot when using ATM\) into various foreign currencies. I travel frequently all around the world. I don't want to link this to any bank account if possible.

What do you guys used? What is cheapest/safest? What are issues with taxation? 

Appreciate any info! Thanks,

Coinbase Got My Funds Back.,"My funds have been returned to the correct address about a month ago.  I updated the posts I had in the past, but wanted to create a new one for the community in case this can help anyone.

I was able to get in contact with a Coinbase representative (GDAX is owned by Coinbase) and after a few email conversations, received this reply:

""I investigated further and have been notified that we are working on recovering funds erroneously sent to BTC or BCH:

If Bitcoin (BTC) is accidentally sent to your Coinbase Bitcoin Cash (BCH) address, we are working on recovering your Bitcoin (BTC).Likewise, if Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was sent to your Coinbase Bitcoin (BTC) address, we are working on recovering your Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Please be patient, as this requires engineering and security effort and coordination.

We recently enabled a Bitcoin (BTC) feature called SegWit, which uses a different address format. Going forward (beginning 02/13/2018), if you send Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to your Coinbase Bitcoin (BTC) address, your funds will not be recoverable.

Question regarding the state of mining 10-20 years+ from now,"Hi all,

Hoping someone could give an educated response or link to this subject.

These days, mining hardware costs a small fortune. Last time I checked miners on average need 8K$ to break even, and yes - some countries are way cheaper.

The fact that mining is expensive is good for the price, obviously.

One argument would be that the cost of global mining HW is and always will be high, and as BTC supply decreases - we have a good chance of deflation and keeping a high price afloat.

But, in year 2040 or 2100 when only a fraction of BTC are generated from mining, compared to today. A simple understanding would be that the BTC price would have to be really high to maintain the incentive to keep mining. Assuming the hashrate continues to grow and mining equipment being equally expensive. A high price is needed.

Another scenario that could be bad, would be miners shutting down which would affect the whole ecosystem negatively.

Please, educate me :) ",1526376853,15/05/2018 09:34:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jk9kd/question_regarding_the_state_of_mining_1020_years/,1

How would sports benefit from blockchain?,"   Over the past few months, applications of blockchain technology have gone main stream. While many industries have been actively exploring this new technology as a tool for value exchange without the need for trust or for a central authority, the sports world, known for being conservative and resistant to innovation seems to be lagging behind and has remained reluctant to developing its own models for integrating blockchain. Whether sports could actually benefit this technology or if it is being overhyped and not applicable in the sports ecosystem is a question that deserves some serious debate. It is yet unarguable that blockchain could contribute to solving some of the biggest problems and challenges currently faced by the sports industry.

  Funding and new business models: one of the chicken and egg problems hitting the sports industry is the inability for most institutions or individuals to drive monetization and generate enough revenue to attract funding. The sports market size often fails to keep up with the huge attention that society pays to sports. Blockchain and the derived token economy could provide the sector with an efficient way to secure funding \(through the issuance of tokens guaranteeing ownership and stake in a project\) and to create new market opportunities as the use of a token facilitates transactions and allows the deployment of new business models \(for example by enhancing fan loyalty and engagement by offering a special range of services to token holders\). Easing both investment and monetization would bring the whole industry to a new virtuous circle.

Transparency and safety: on a blockchain network, data is complete, accurate and consistent across participants. Through the distributed ledger structure, transaction information is accessible to all relevant users. The integration of smart contracts also makes transactions more secure and provide all users with an enhanced level of trust. The sports world has long been hit by scandals such as the recent FIFA corruption allegations, reflecting the lack of a structural layer to protect everyone against the misbehavior of other parties.

Decentralization: the sports world is now dominated by a few large institutions and it is hard for the smaller participants to emerge as contenders. Blockchains provide everyone with equal rights and the power to build the applications they want without being subject to any superior authority. Removing “middlemen” is crucial in achieving market efficiency and encouraging more initiatives. Decentralized ticketing and betting platforms with reduced commission fees are great examples of applications that would contribute to redistributing the value across all participants.

Founded in December 2017 by Dutch football legend Wesley Sneijder and Sino\-American entrepreneur QiangBai, vSport is aan open\-source platform based on the blockchain technology targeting the global sports industry. vSport’s strategic partners include 433, the world’s largest football community on social media \(headquartered in the Netherlands\) and Sport 8, China’s biggest youth sports platform.

The main goal of vSport is to enable a better redistribution of the value within the sports world, from grassroots to professional levels.

 vSport is now building a network of high traffic\-communities with over 45 million fans across the world \(incl. 15 million in China\). In the future, vSport plans to launch its Sports Value Evaluation System and its Sports Value Exchange platform on a global scale. 

The vSport platform is fueled by the vSportCoin \(VSC\), which can be used for transactions such as products and tickets purchases, rewards of fan engagement on social media, funding of young athletes, payments of premium memberships with clubs, players’ digital rights, etc.VSC will be listed on exchanges on May 20th, 2018.

"Very bad experience with Bitnovo, possible scam.","Hello, I'll summarize my experience with them, and then copy the entire conversation with customer care and then let you decide if this should be normal.
In brief, I made a mistake in transferring BTC to the previous BTC adress they provided, not the new one. I contacted them right away and asked if they could help me out that they should also have access to old BTC addresses. The response was ""sorry we can't help because our system automatically deletes old private keys, so that sum wil stay in limbo"". Well, that is plausible, so I cursed at my mistake and went on with life. The next day I checked if the sent BTC is still in this address and in limbo, and what I discovered, the BTC was moved couple of hours after and is now part of an active wallet! I e-mailed them asking about it, and now got a totally different answer, that the bitcoins are being held by their supplier and they still can't return them. I asked them if they could contact their supplier or at least give me their contact so I can contact them myself, so I can ask back the money that doesn't belong to them. I even offered them a 15% penalty of that sum for my mistake. But I was only ignored and repeated that you have been informed that we can't return your bitcoins, without any logical reason given for it. To me it is the same if I start to pay in the store, and accidentally hand a 200€ bill instead of 10€, right away discovering my mistake and asking back the over payed bill, but the clerk will just pocket it and say ""sorry, I no longer can take this 200€ bill out of my pocket"" ""why you ask? well, just because.."".

I will not take legal action against them because if they are experiences scammers then it will not take me far. But I will make this experience as public as possible so people could know what can be expected from them. Any feedback is welcome!

Here is the entire conversation with customer care:

Our recharge system change the wallet for every request of the recharge. In this case, we do not have any access to sent tokens as once the recharge is made, the private keys are destroyed. Even if the transaction has been sent correctly, it stays in limbo.
We are really sorry but we cannot help you to solve this problem.
Please, be more careful when making recharges so we can avoid similar problems.

Hello,
in the previous replies, there were no mention of an external supplier. The mention of the external supplier contradicts your previous reply where you told that it is YOUR RECHARGE SYSTEM, and the problem was in PRIVATE KEYS BEING DESTROYED. Now the reason given for not sending back the coins is totally different. No more talks about money being in the limbo, but instead it being in the hands of your external supplier.
Quote from your precious reply: ""Our recharge system change the wallet for every request of the recharge. In this case, we do not have any access to sent tokens as once the recharge is made, theprivate keys are destroyed.""
Do you understand how this looks to anyone, when after this reply, the same bitcoins moved?
Now, please give me a contact of that ""external supplier"", that supposedly has access to my bitcoins, that are not his. If that ""external supplier"" stone-walls me without answers, then I will work hard to make this entire situation public.
This is a matter of principal, that customers shouldn't be fooled like this. If I won't get help from anyone, then the only thing left to do, is to send our correspondence to every forum, blog or web portal, that deals with the subject of cryptocurrency and who could be interested in a story. I hope that you will stop playing with me and actually help me. I'm not an easy guy to just push over. 300€ doesn't mean much to me, but someone trying to fool me, means a lot to me. I'm willing to forget all of this if you will really help me solve this situation. So, please, take this more seriously. 300€ should not be worth all this highly suspicious activity.

Dear customer,
Wallets used for recharges are constantly changed for the security reasons. Once the wallet was used all the enter details are destroyed in our system so Bitnovo does NOT have access to them.
If you ever have worked with Exchanges you would know that the wallet to store your coins is not really yours but it is owned and managed by the Exchange house. However, you still use it and say it is yours. The same happens with ""our recharge system"", as we work with it we call it ours even if it really does not belong to us.
The coins were sent to wrong wallet. We are sorry but we cannot restore it.
Kind regards

May 14, 12:38 CEST 
If that is true, then it means that the Exchange house has access to my bitcoins.
At first I was told that it is impossible to return my bitcoins because the private keys are destroyed. In that case, it truly would have been impossible. But it turned out that the private keys weren't destroyed but were added to someones active wallet.
You are saying that the wallet is in the hands of ""the Exchange house"" that is a supplier of Bitnovo. That is good because this can be fixed easily by contacting them and telling that they have this many BTC in their wallet, that were transferred by mistake. This can be confirmed easily by seeing that this address had 2 transfers instead not 1, like usually. I'm willing to offer 15% of 300€ as a penalty for my mistake and have no more objections. This would be fair.
It would be great if you could contact your partner Exchange house yourself and say that this many bitcoins were given surplus and should be sent back. Should be a quick and easy process, a lot quicker then this conversation we're having. But if you aren't willing to do that, then please give me their contact e-mail, so I can speak with them myself and see if they are pocketing money that shouldn't belong to them.
And if they are thieves, then I'm more then obligated to make this situation as public as possible. Any respectable company should be warned about an Exchange house like that. If they have access to bitcoins that were sent to the wrong address, then there is no justification to just pocket them and refuse to return them. It would have only made sense if the private keys would have been destroyed, and that didn't happen.
I truly hope that we will find a solution here, and none of us have to waste any more time on this situation.

Consensus 2018: Evolution of Bitcoin Acceptance,"Consensus 2018 is the largest Bitcoin conference ever. Libertarians, Business Owners, and Financial institutions are coming together in the greatest numbers we've ever seen.

In addition to the Libertarians, Coders, Crypto Businesses/Exchanges the roll call has some high profile industry leaders from outside the Cryptosphere, including:

-President of the St. Louis FED
-Twitter CEO
-FedEx CEO

Representatives from:

-Microsoft
-IBM
-SEC
-CFTC
-World Economic Forum
-Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency(HSARPA)


Bitcoin is being taken more seriously than ever before. Just a few years ago we were laughed at for suggesting Bitcoin would compete with the FED. Now we have presidents of FED banks speaking at the annual preeminent Bitcoin conference.

Bitcoin is turning institutions inside out. Individuals act principally in their best interests ; even if their behavior harms the group as a whole. This is called ""Tragedy of the commons"" ; when a resource is overutilized to the point where it is unusable for everyone.

Bitcoin turns this on its head. Bitcoins properties attracts speculators looking out for their best interests. These speculators then have an interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and use the leverage at their disposal to do so.

So while Bitcoin is a threat to the power and sovereignty of every government and bank on Earth ; it is individuals who make up those institutions.

Individuals within governments and banks adopt Bitcoin for (hopeful) personal profit. These people aren't trying to overthrow governments and banks; but they will do what they can to soften their institutions stance on their investment.

As Bitcoin continues going through its growth cycles it attracts more and more individuals. More and more people in more institutions that have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin grow. These people support projects and initiatives that increase Bitcoins usefulness and therefore adds to its overall value proposition; which helps create a positive feedback loop.

That is the genius of the Bitcoin revolution. No bloodshed required. No protesting. Bitcoin is as much applied computer science and cryptography as it is a global psychological operation. We are re-inventing the concept of value.

Instead of fighting the old system we are building a better system. Instead of forcing people to change with threats of violence; people willingly change to chase profits.

The end-game for this revolution is the end of central banks. Global Value/Currency Standard. Peoples savings will grow in value over time at the pace of productivity increases. People will no longer lose value to inflation. Governments will not be able to spend money they do not have. Unprofitable businesses supported by subsidies will fail. Defense spending will fall dramatically around the globe.

Bitcoin can solve most of the problems whose root cause is ""money"". Bitcoin cannot fix greed and human nature; but it can mitigate the damage done by greedy and power hungry individuals.",1526386032,15/05/2018 12:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jl1ld/consensus_2018_evolution_of_bitcoin_acceptance/,1

Bitcoin Fungibility,"Hello all,

What technological adaptations are on the horizon to make BTC fungible? 

- I know Bulletproofs are currently a very realistic reality, but I believe this only applies to amount sent.
- STARKS are currently being researched, are those possible to be implemented?

I have a position in the only fungible asset in this sphere (no need to name it, I don't want to break rules) but I can see a reality where it is no longer useful as a SoV because Bitcoin achieves fungibility.

I look forward to hearing back.

Consensus 2018,"So, I thought people were saying the price was supposed to go UP during and after Consensus 2018, not DOWN.

There are over 7500 participants this year, some of the biggest names in tech and government (for better or worse).

I guess this means, with yet another data point, that this market is completely unpredictable. And anyone who sells you dreams of bitcoin reaching xx price by xx date, should be taken with a grain of salt, no matter what their accolades. The simple truth is that the only thing that will increase the price of bitcoin is increasing use of it.

This is why it's so important for the community to actually buy and spend. This stagnation is caused by all users, not just a few.

Mind you, stagnation is relative. We're still up around 500% from this time last year. But days and years in bitcoin happen about 1000x faster than just about any other industry.",1526408513,15/05/2018 18:21:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jnuk7/consensus_2018/,1

"""History shows that no government, after going on a fiat monetary system, ever reverses course until its paper currency is destroyed. There is no reason to believe this time will be any different."" - CMI Gold &amp; Silver","[https://www.cmi\-gold\-silver.com/article/gold\-standard\-inflation\-fiat\-money/](https://www.cmi-gold-silver.com/article/gold-standard-inflation-fiat-money/) is the source of the quote.

I did some research on the value of the dollar over the course of US history \(at least, as far back as I could find. What I discovered was that the value of the dollar relative to the \*median\* price of gold over the last 225 years has crashed significantly and not recovered twice. \*Only\* twice. Once was at the beginning of the great depression, and the other was the minute the gold standard was abolished.

Note: There was a scenario on a similar scale of the great depression during the Colorado Gold Rush of 1859, but this only applies to gold and I think this is due to peoples' tastes and preferences leaning towards gold. The gold rush must have affected demand more than supply, because the price nearly doubled. That's the only thing I can think of to explain it.

Regardless, the price of gold returned to the median in just a little under two decades \-\- very short in the history of the US. Here are the excel graphs I made that caused me to discover this phenomenon.

For those in bitcoin watching Consensus 2018 live from NYC contemplating Shapeshift's and Kraken's comments on the problems of bitlicense: there are some bitlicense proposals left to defeat.,"New York. Connecticut. Hawaii. Nebraska. Alaska. North Carolina.

These are all U.S. states where the Coin Center and the ULC have been pushing for bitlicense to be made law. In New York, where bitlicense was passed as a regulation, the battle against it is being waged in the courts. North Carolina passed its own bitlicense law. In all the other states above, there are right now bitlicense bills that have been introduced which you can help stop.

For more information and how to help (especially if you live in one of the above states):

Listening to predictions on bitcoin?,"So, I thought people were saying the price was supposed to go UP during and after Consensus 2018, not DOWN.

There are over 7500 participants this year, some of the biggest names in tech and government (for better or worse).

I guess this means, with yet another data point, that this market is completely unpredictable. And anyone who sells you dreams of bitcoin reaching xx price by xx date, should be taken with a grain of salt, no matter what their accolades. The simple truth is that the only thing that will increase the price of bitcoin is increasing use of it.

This is why it's so important for the community to actually buy and spend. This stagnation is caused by all users, not just a few.

Mind you, stagnation is relative. We're still up around 500% from this time last year. But days and years in bitcoin happen about 1000x faster than just about any other industry.",1526419248,15/05/2018 21:20:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jpakg/listening_to_predictions_on_bitcoin/,1

"Some bitcoinish ""killer app"" thoughts. Tell me why I'm wrong.","So, I've been dicking around today, playing games, drinking, etc. The kind of shit you do when you're just off in your own space and I had a couple of ideas that I thought were pretty decent. I'm eagerly looking forward to having them destroyed. I think I've got it, though. Really.

In short, its a credit agency almost completely decoupled from an individuals identity, that relies on a historical blockchain transaction data and modern analytics to determine if an individual is a good risk or not.

Now I realize this sounds simple, but it seems like such an obvious place for bitcoin to start. I don't have details worked out since this is a day dream, more or less, and its also not my field even remotely, but the question I was asking when I came up with this notion is ""what can bitcoin do that legacy banking systems cannot?"".

The answers I came up with were 

1. An open source, secure, unforgeable, database of historical *transactions*.

2. An insanely fast settlement layer. Between LN and the blockchain its just no contest anymore. This is where I want some parsing. Without talking about TPS, which is a tech problem that is being solved, please explain to me why the ad hoc system like Visa (or MC, AE, Discover, etc) +  whatever your random banks loan officer is superior to the publicly available and instantly verifiable data that could be gleaned from whatever blockchain you happen to use?

3. There just isn't as much of a need for personal information. Credit agencies are a MASSIVE weak point in our financial system as Equifax so cleanly demonstrated to us. Having a third party centralizing personal identifying data that could be used for identity theft is a tremendous risk. If you're an American, its safe to assume at this point that your personal identifying data, all of which can be used to completely demolish your ability to obtain lines of credit or finance major life events, is pretty much publicly available. Rather than having control of your *own data*, under the legacy system you've ceded control of it, like in the case of equifax, to a music major who cares so much about your identity that literally all of your personal data was exposed to internet protected by the password ""admin"". If you think this level of opsec and care is an outlier, I've got a bridge to sell you, payable in bitcoin. Super cheap, too. I'll underbid freaking anyone. Try me.

In any case, since loans are being distributed based on middling at best quality data, the massively superior quality of data that pretty much any publicly auditable blockchain is capable of delivering would make this service a no brainer. 

Think, a Cambridge Analytica who, instead of trying to subvert the political will of people internationally, was able to use the bitcoin blockchain coupled analytic techniques to provide sub prime loans for housing that were *actually safe bets and not likely to blow up the global financial system*. 

My wife and I recently bought our first house, and its insane to me how some of these businesses decide who to loan to. I mean, I had to provide paychecks and whatnot, but those are all forgeable documents, you know? Tax records, likewise, but how difficult would it be to set up a shell company for no other purpose but to pay taxes for no other reason but to acquire a significantly larger amount of money with no intent of paying it back? Personal data used to be the safeguard, but since its essentially public information at this point, how could you possibly make lending decisions like that knowing that who you're sitting in front of could be pretty much anyone? I'm sure there's insurance and governmental guarantees and whatnot, but all of that is, frankly, superfluous financial infrastructure if you could dial down those risks. 

Also: super short term loans.

For most people, the notion of grabbing a million+ dollar loan out of thin air is absurd. For banks, its equally absurd. There's so much due diligence required on the back end to determine an individuals credit worthiness that amounts to little more than digging through and aggregating historical financial data that lending to people who may not have the same kind of financial history as, say, the already wealthy that it rapidly becomes not worth the effort at all unless your bank account is sufficiently large and you have significant collateral to provide. Blockchains not only aggregate a lot of that data for you, but they provide previously impossible transaction/account scrutiny. Say, for instance, massive subset of people who payback their loans have a tendency to spend and receive cash in a very specific pattern, its entirely possible that in the future those data points become WAY more important for evaluating credit worthiness than something as rudimentary as a missed payment, you know?

I feel like missed payments and other significant factors in your credit worthiness are more of a best guess based on currently available information, but there's a real possibility that information contained in a massive open source database like bitcoin could prove to be a much more accurate smoking gun that could, at the end of the day, mitigate risks to the lender and create a situation where many, many more people have access to financial services because lenders have access to better, more granular financial data, and those lenders, as a result, make a LOT more money.

Our current legacy system has, as its backbone, a level of inscrutability. That inscrutability has provided some level of security by obscurity, but the world has changed dramatically in the past 20 plus years. Obscurity is rightly recognized as not security at all, but as onerous complexity. This recognizance, however, has not been shared by some financial businesses which rely on obscurity as security since changing the business model up costs money and why would they waste money?

There's a massive sucking sound, and that sound is obscurity being pulled out of the room by quality information, AI, and the ability of engineers to ask the right, most pertinent questions. Many of our most important institutions are run by older folks who often struggle to reckon with an update to their phone, let alone a technological revolution of their livelihood. 

This represents a business opportunity for those of us who are nimble. 

USAA has a very strong business model that, in part, relies, or relied initially anyhow, on the fact that military people and their families are cheaper to insure and bank for than others. Gmail pulled a similar thing when it came out, but failed in the same strategy with google plus. The reason it worked with USAA and Gmail and not with google plus, is because at the time those services were legit superior products. I had shitty ass hotmail at the time Gmail got rolled out, and back then there was no comparison. I can't really speak to USAA as much. I bank with them and they're pretty run of the mill, tbh, cheaper on some things, not so much on others, but the I kinda think USAA had its heyday a while ago. 

Likewise, gmail isn't a much better service than, say, outlook or yahoo or whatever.

But it was at one point.

We're at that point with bitcoin. Bitcoiner specific services will make this ecosystem explode. If you, as someone who owns bitcoin, can get a credit card for, say, half the APR of a non bitcoiner, you'd have people buying bitcoin like hotcakes and if there's one undeniable truth about bitcoin and other cryptos its that they are bull and bear amplifiers in an unprecedented way.

Banks aren't going away anytime soon. Neither is bitcoin. The future is an a weird marriage of the two and the way it gains traction is by giving the early adopters a hell of a deal.",1526420125,15/05/2018 21:35:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jpeli/some_bitcoinish_killer_app_thoughts_tell_me_why/,1

"Coinbase held my funds for no reason, so I called them...","Last Friday, I made a purchase from my bank account for a measly 200 bucks. The fees for buying directly from my checking account have always been much lower than using debit or credit cards, not to mention all of my cc's have banned the platform anyway. They applied the BTC to my account, but for the first time, I couldn't do anything with it outside of the Coinbase platform \(that includes moving it to GDAX\). The CB platform charges fees for every single transaction \(buy or sell\), in addition to boosting the price on all coins for purchases and then selling them back below market value as well \(this has got to the definition of economical double penetration, lol\). Today is Tuesday, and my 200 in BTC is still being held. So, I called their customer service.

To their credit, I was on hold for less than 3 minutes, and here is a paraphrase of the convo:

Me: I've made a deposit and I can't access it. I've made hundreds of deposits from this account in the past and its always been immediate access. I've never experienced this, can you please check it out?

CB: We recently updated our platform and you signed up to receive the update.

Me: No I didn't. I signed on to a pop\-up message that said my limits have been increased, but I never asked for or accepted any account upgrade; nor did I ask for my limits to be increased. You did that on your own. Can I go back to the old platform?

CB: No you can't. This is how the platform will operate for customers going forward.

Me: Look, the reason I made this purchase was to transfer those funds and purchase altcoins. The market is extremely volatile right now, and I want to diversify my portfolio. By the time you release the funds, the market could have rebounded and I lose a great opportunity.

CB: In regards to your deposit, you have to wait the until the deposit clears.

Me: It has cleared, and the funds were taken out of my account. I can prove it momentarily if you like.

CB: It has to clear our bank, not yours.

Me: I dont even know what that means. Your issue would seem to be crediting a buyer who turns out to have insufficient funds, which has never been my case.

CB: I'm sorry, we are not able to manually release funds.

Me: Are you going to give me interest for holding my $ without giving me access to it?

CB: No, once it clears, you will have access to it.

Me: My debit card from this bank does not allow me to purchase from you, but if I were to have used my debit card and subject myself to your insane fees \(the fees for using a card are wayyy more than for bank accounts\) would that have been instant access?

CB: Yes.

Me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5GS0MS5gU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5GS0MS5gU)

I've had a verified CB account \(from which I've made weekly deposits\) for a few years now; never had a real issue. I was always able to do whatever I wanted immediately as long as it wasn't a fiat deposit to the USD wallet. To add insult to injury, lol, I was an avid supporter of CB as I felt they have a rare and special opportunity to facilitate access while educating Main St. in regards to Bitcoin and crypto. Now, if I want to do anything with my coins, they are forcefking me to deposit via debit or credit card which incurs the highest fees their platform offers. 5 days after the purchase, I am still unable to trade, send, or even access the funds \(meaning I can't withdraw them\). Finally, I am able to see the true colors of Coinbase.

You are a greedy cck\-sucker Coinbase. I get that you're a business, and as an American, I respect that and your need to make a profit. However, your new terms of service resembles that of developing countries dictatorship. You tie people down and force them to operate within the avenues of your site that incurs insane fees! You are purposefully trapping people within your platform and forcing us to pay you if we want to do anything at all with our money. Isn't cryptocurrency supposed to allow me control of my money? Is my freedom to do what I want with my funds without anyone telling me how or when to do it not a backbone part of what decentralized currency is supposed to be all about?

In essence, you are going against the very bedrock foundation of what the asset that made you rich stands for, you greedy smug mf'er. I will not use my debit cards \(even if I could\), I refuse to let you force me to pay your insane fees, and you can suck my ballz. Sooner or later, someone will come thru and wrek your business model. Until then, you can suck on BBC. \(\&lt;\-\-\-\-\- not a coin\).",1526422111,15/05/2018 22:08:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jpnmt/coinbase_held_my_funds_for_no_reason_so_i_called/,1

There can be only one,"To quote a line from Highlander, there can be only one crypto coin. In reality all the Alt coins and bitcoin bashing is to do with people wanting to make a quick buck out of pumping their coins  because they fear they’ve missed out on the bitcoin ride. Trouble is they don’t really understand or believe in the fundamentals. What they don’t see is that Bitcoin is like TCP/IP. It’s already what it needs to be. Protocols stack on top to build better services. With lightning and other layers added to bitcoin, we just won’t need the Alt-coins. Even if eventually we need to upgrade the chain with bigger blocks it will still be bitcoin. A fork is when some group wants to go their own way and has to persuade the majority to move with them. However for now the majority of those who really get bitcoin are building layers on top of the bitcoin protocol and not any other protocol. Do you agree with this statement?",1526425830,15/05/2018 23:10:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jq3cd/there_can_be_only_one/,1

What is GrabAirdrop.com?,"I will try to inform you about grabairdrop.com in this article, but everyone may not be familiar with the intricacies of the cryptocurrency world and airdrops. So here is some basic information and definitions before we get to grabairdrop.com, shall we?

What Are Airdrops?

When a cryptocurrency enterprise distributes crypto tokens to the wallets of some users free of charge, for multiple reasons, that process is called airdrops.

Airdrops can be announced earlier, but they may come as a surprise as well, the awareness of them depends on the involvement level of the users.

There are many online and social media channels where interested users follow airdrops and share information about them to each other.

GrabAirDrop

This is where GrabAirDrop comes in. The website is essentially another airdrop website that shares and carries this same information for interested users. However, their much more compact style of sharing information compared to message boards, chat groups, social media postings, etc. makes them worthy to use for interested parties.

As far as design and practical usage ability go, the fact that the website has easily accessible information makes it a better choice than messy message boards and chats or “too complicated for simple, practical, quick and effectively informative usage” type of other airdrop websites.

GrabAirDrop has a calendar in the home page as soon as you get to their website. And there are relatively few other categories and pages left. This makes it so that the compact design allows the information to be on the home page with an easily accessible gadget.

On the calendar, you may choose specific dates and see what is available. After which kinds of airdrops are available revealed, you may choose to click them and a new page pops up. There are a large number of contact information, history, basic information where GrabAirDrops talks about offering wallets to its customers.

The calendar home page and specific information pages make it easy to:

* Gauge what is available when

* Gauge the features and basic history of the airdrop

And the way that these two features are connected with only a click genuinely helps the website to stand out in terms of what information is the most accessible and practical to reach for users out there.

Interactive

So the compact design and accessible information might be the reasons to use GrabAirDrop ahead of other channels where you get information. But how can GrabAirDrop can compete with group chats’ and message boards’ interactively informative approach? The answer is, it does not.

Yes, there are a number of options you might need to be aware of and multiple people in a conversational website might look like they would find more available airdrops and information about them. However, the “request” page of GrabAirDrop really solves this issue. That page works as a delivery page for token info to be published with the website runners and hence the users of the website are able to affect the information just like message boards, group chats, social media applications. But without the overall messiness of these platforms as the website stays put.

There are certain parameters to fill and your information would be checked before adding it to the website, so the information is not speculative but actually trustworthy. This feature in this specific website allows these things:

* You are able to completely trust the information compared to message boards, social media and group chats due to the filter that is provided by the website itself when submitting information on the “request” page.

* Along with the compactness and practical way of the home page delivers information for the interested parties, GrabAirDrop takes another advantage ahead of other places as it keeps the spreading information feature; but even improving there, and completely minimizing the possibility of speculative information. So the interactive token information sharing is there, but even more trustworthy than most other places you can imagine to find any information from.

If you are still not comfortable enough with the website’s features and its advantages over its competitors, you may simply go to their “contact us” page and maybe get in an exchange between them and I’m sure you will be able to feel safer towards their approach and execution for your interests.

I hope I was able to summarize why GrabAirDrop is a useful website for crypto people to think of and use. Soon, we will post ICOs that we think are worth to invest in right now as well.",1526432351,16/05/2018 00:59:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jqu9r/what_is_grabairdropcom/,1

I'm worried for the accessibility of my coin now. I'm hoping it's something simple and maybe someone here has an idea. But I'm not here for tech support, I'm still in the process. I'll install a whole new machine with nothing but chrome and those apps on it if I have to.

Mainly I wanted to shame my abysmal support experience.

I'd upload screenshots but Reddit doesn't do that and I'm not gonna dick around with anything third party. 

Seriously though, just play with this submission process to see what I mean.

Thanks from Bookcoin!,"Thanks to everyone who visited [Bookcoin](https://bookcoinshop.com) these last 24 hours.  We're very excited to get this platform off the ground and have taken all of the feedback we've received to heart!

Here are the updates we've implemented so far since last night:

1\) We've updated our currency exchange to include 5 switchable conversions: USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, and AUD

2\) The formatting of our [Custom Order](https://bookcoinshop.com/products/custom-order) page has been tightened up to be more user friendly to both desktop and mobile users

3\) We've increased the order limit to $250 from $150

4\) We've begun repricing our catalog of pre\-listed items to match Amazon prices. Shortly all listings will match closely and we will continue to add new popular listings.

We've some plans in the near future \(ideally by week's end\) to implement:

1\) An Escrow platform to help provide more security in jumping into a purchase with our new store

2\) Easy Digital Gift Card purchase implementation \(Amazon, Netflix, etc.\)

3\) Most exciting of all, more coins to accept!

We will consider all suggestions, so please provide any feedback, nice or tough :\)

We've had several orders today and hope that word will spread on our ability to follow through on what we've represented here.  Cheers!",1526442709,16/05/2018 03:51:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jrz3f/thanks_from_bookcoin/,1

binance support phone number,1-866-995-4355.This number is listed when you Google Binance support phone number. I got a guy that I let onto my computer to help me get into my account because I was locked out because I didn't set up the 2f authenticate. He then somehow got codes from Binance and opened my account. I couldn't see what he was doing but he said that he was working on linking my phone were the application is installed so it would take the codes. He had me on hold for a long time and then said he could call me back when it was completed. He never did. I think that he took the money out of my account. It is still locked and I can't see what's going on. Then I called back and the phone was blocked and said that the number had been disconnected. I used another phone and they told me he was fired and no longer with the company. Then I called back using a different name and they asked me how much money I had in my account and then put me through to someone who claimed that my Corn-based account wallet was corrupted and wanted to set up a new wallet for me. This is when I hung up and was sure that it is a scam. DO NOT USE THIS NUMBER!!! IT IS A SCAM!

Bitcoin,"In decentralized systems, so\-called ""peer\-to\-peer"" systems mean that every computer is an integral work unit without authorization with any central unit. For such systems, the rule is that there is no bank behind them, the government of some country or individual, but only the network of users and traders, where, on the basis of the law of supply and demand on the domestic market, the price of one is borne. One of the key elements of this system is anonymity in transactions, where each individual transaction is broadcast on the network and all users have an insight into the execution and validity of the transaction itself in the so\-called ""proof of work"" \(proof of work/activity\) but not personally to whom he has sent and where there is a certain number of whom. Each transaction is performed with the help of the digital signatures of the user, private and public key as well as the combination of the transaction itself, which makes any type of falsification significantly more difficult. The word triggered by such crypt valued would be ""everyone has control, and no one has the power"". The most famous crypt valued with this mode of production is **Bitcoin**.",1526470683,16/05/2018 11:38:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ju7ej/bitcoin/,1

Bitcoin Daily Supply Inflation and Price Maintenance - Theoretical Discussion,"Summary: A certain number of Bitcoins are mined each day. This new supply needs to be either purchased when presented to the open market or incentivized away from the open market to maintain the current market price of Bitcoin.

Detail: As of today, 2018-05-16, Bitcoin's block reward is 12.5 BTC / block. Nominally one block is mined every 10 minutes, for 144 blocks in a day, which leads to 1800 BTC mined daily. This will halve around May 2020 to 6.25 BTC / block or 900 BTC / day.

For this illustration to work we must move forward ceteris paribus, holding steady the variable that market participants will either hodl all currently available coins or trade on an even basis among themselves.

In order to maintain Bitcoin's market price this new supply needs to be absorbed on a continual basis. If we set our target at BTC-USD $10,000 we come up with the amount of $18,000,000 / day in new Bitcoin supply. After May 2020 this daily amount will come down to $9,000,000 / day if BTC-USD $10,000 is to be held.

The question is - Can the market participants maintain a purchase rate of USD $18,000,000 a day for the next year and a half? How many market participants are there, and how much are they buying individually? Are 99% of newly mined coins being purchased by 1% of the market participants? 90/10? 80/20? 50/50?

I'm interested to see what sort of analysis evolves in the discussion on this topic as I've been contemplating it for a while and have not been able to ascertain adequate answers to these questions.",1526476314,16/05/2018 13:11:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jush4/bitcoin_daily_supply_inflation_and_price/,1

Bitcoin (crypto) death spiral,"I've seen quite a few articles about the so called ""Bitcoin death spiral"" few weeks ago, but since then nobody is talking about the subject. Not sure if it's heavily moderated, thus such posts never make it on reddit anymore or the people just don't care or don't believe it will happen, thus not showing much interest.

Basically, the ""death spiral"" refers to the repeated cycles oh shorting the Bitcoin ( or any other currency ) until its value goes close to 0. This is not some of the ""Bitcoin will go to 0"" old theories that appeared pre 2013 since in those old theories nobody had the incentive to actually bring Bitcoin to 0. However, in the death spiral theory, the ones shorting the Bitcoin ( Banks, Governments etc ) can actually destroy it WHILE STILL MAKING A PROFIT and never even having to own/touch a single Bitcoin! 
This is a win-win for them and I was wondering if the community have any plans on how this can be countered, other than just downvoting, trolling or ignoring the theory. In all the threads I've previously read, 90-95% of the replies were troll or meme based.",1526479289,16/05/2018 14:01:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jv53f/bitcoin_crypto_death_spiral/,1

Brands are the sole issuer of product-pairings on the blockchain. This way, brands can ensure exactly how many authentic copies are released. Disingenuous manufacturers are no longer able to produce imitations that can be passed off as authentic, because they cannot replicate the token.

Review of walletrecoveryservices.com,"So one more review.

I contacted Dave the 5th May 2015 with -of course- a lost password problem. (note to myself: never choose a password when you're drunk)
I thought I had a good idea of what it could be (something about 26 characters long, with capital letters and symbols; very simple) and gave him a lot of hints. But this didn't worked.
Yesterday I got an email from him to say he finally found the password.
So he took his cut (we agreed before starting the process) and I finally regain control over my BTC. (and BCH of course)

So, I can only warmly recommend the service :)

Thanks Dave !

Bitcoin Gives Me Faith in the Future And I’m not alone.,"Across the world, there is a question of trust.   
Assets disappear, currencies devalue, properties ceased, tax laws changed.  Even safe-haven bank deposits can be unilaterally gouged by negative interest rates.    My financial future is being controlled by political forces which I object to. 
   
And there is a lot going on that I object to… the collusion in big pharma and big banking.  Libor rates are rigged, funds are embezzled, collusion, fraud, unethical practices abound.  Across so many industries it the same story: big gone bad. 

But why does ‘big’ become ‘bad’?   One reason is it is hard to follow the money.  In most industries the mesh of rebates, kickbacks, subsidies and transfer pricing, confounds the ability to detect and fix problems. These kickbacks,  prevalent in every industry, are symptoms of a deeper structural problem : Layers of intermediaries and aggregators have confounded the transparency needed to detect and fix problems. 

Antiquated workflow processes, put in place by ‘appointed’ middle men, the elite who are ‘permissioned’ in the middle, create hidden relationships and hidden agreements.  Once in place, unintended collusion calcifies the industry, stalls innovation and invites theft.   

Take for example one of the largest, most liquid markets in world, the U.S. Stock Market.  It’s a fully digital market, yet every time I purchase a share of stock , more than five intermediaries are part of the transaction.  Why?  Think of the possibilities for misappropriation at each step.  Think about the inefficiencies.  

And ‘middlemen’, because of where they sit, are quite powerful.   Their ethics are tested every day.  They have information advantage, knowing both sides of the transaction.  They control access, they set artificial boundaries, they can dictate price.  In financial services, some intermediaries can re-use our assets without remuneration, generating ‘free float’ with our assets.   And, as we see with Facebook, middlemen can use our behaviors against our own self-interests.  

But, if we could collapse the middlemen, make transparent the transactions, eliminate information asymmetry, there could be a fix to the mess we are in. 

Bitcoin eliminates the middlemen. Using technology to drive consensus and vet transactions, the distributed, open access paradigm allows for everyone to participate.  There are no appointed middlemen to restrict entrance or to dictate the terms of membership.  

To me, when I think of bitcoin, it is more than a digital currency.  It is an economic platform for people around the world.  People just like me who are fearful of the elected – and unelected -- third parties who control our financial well-being.   

So, as a peer-to-peer economic platform that eliminates the need for antiquated, intervening ‘middlemen’, both bitcoin and blockchain-inspired markets look clean, accessible and efficient.   This is why, bitcoin and blockchain-based markets give me faith in the future.

Do folks like video or text? I'm also considering some coding livestreams, if people would find that helpful. If any of this sounds interesting to you, I'm running a small webinar next week to test the waters and gauge interest. I'd love for you to participate. Thanks :)

Proof someone actually wants to see bitcoin succeed...,"There are many big entities, well-known public figures, etc. talking big about bitcoin now. From Jamie Dimon bashing it (then suddenly believing in it), what it comes down to is very simple: dollars and cents.

If you want to see whether someone believes in bitcoin (or at least wants to profit off it short-term) or not, determine if they have actually bought/traded any. If they're talking big, but doing nothing, you can take what they say with a grain of salt. In order for one's words to have any real import, a person needs to have some skin in the game, have a feel for the market, the sentiment, the community, the people.

So when I hear Bill Gates bash bitcoin but refuse to short it, his words then become utter nonsense to me--or rather, what he says will be contrary to what will likely happen. When I hear Warren Buffet bash bitcoin but refuse to learn about the technology, it's the same way.

Actions over words. When someone's actions are requisite to their words, then you can tell they're not trying to pull a fast one on you (usually; sometimes they still can find a way to do so). When someone's actions are contrary to their words, or they do nothing to match their words, their words are either meaningless, or less than meaningless.

But ultimately, what it comes down to, is you taking action yourself. You prove you have agency by jumping in, and not simply listening to the projections of others.",1526498837,16/05/2018 19:27:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jxqpd/proof_someone_actually_wants_to_see_bitcoin/,1

cryptopcash : a cli cryptocurrency portfolio,"[cryptopcash](https://github.com/rpesche/cryptopcash) allow you to view infos about all your cryptopcurrency holding in a beautiful cli interface.


It is similar to [cryptop](https://github.com/huwwp/cryptop) but with some extra functionnality :

* Correct handling of window resizing using [urwid](https://github.com/urwid/urwid)
* Show the name of crypto-currency instead of 
Acronym (""Bitcoin"" instead of ""BTC)
* code splited in several files instead of juste one big file


I plan to add some cool features :

* flexible ui allowing you to choose wich infos you wan't to see
* Price history visualization
* Batch mode for scripting (juste print total holding in stdin for example)

Feel free to use it and open as much issues as you want.

Proof of stake is really reliable?,"Peercoin introduced the proof-of-stake model in order to solve the problems that Bitcoin faces for working over Proof-of-work. In this model, nodes votes are weighted on, depending on the implementation, the held amount or a bet/tip (stake) over the voted block. This way, those who hold higher amounts have a stronger voting power than those who don’t. Proof-of-Stake defenders admit it and say that hardly someone who owns a huge amount of a PoS-based currency could act in a way that could be negative for the currency’s blockchain, since this user would see his portfolio also losing value if the currency presented some flaws due to his behavior. If, however, a competitor does a calculated investment, buying lots of coins or even persuading several heavy-holders to act in ways that could break the network (i.e. voting in invalid blocks, DoSing etc.), would not it be able to break the currency ecosystem? Also, is PoS not dangerous for the currency democratic system, since if you do not hold a good amount, your voting power is almost nullable? How does PoS-based systems protect their democracy, network integrity and security?",1526504966,16/05/2018 21:09:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jyjpb/proof_of_stake_is_really_reliable/,1

"Was Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson the true OG ""Crypto Bro""?","I got into an argument with a co-worker over whether Ben Franklin deserves credit for defending the inalienable right to create our own currency. Ironically, Franklin is on the $100 bill but I don't think he'd want to be. 

In 1729, a 23-year-old Franklin wrote [A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/publications/economic-education/ben-franklin-and-paper-money-economy.pdf) In it, he argued for a new currency that brought economic stability to working classes and angered established elites. After the revolution, Franklin was instrumental in establishing a currency that helped pull people out of poverty, writing  ""Where there is a free government, and the people make their own laws by their representatives, I see no injustice in their obliging one another to take their own paper money."" The Colonial Scrip, and Britain outlawing the colonial currency, eventually became major points on the road to Revolution.

As my co-worker points out, while Franklin was supportive of a national bank issuing notes backed by gold and silver reserves, he wasn't as outspoken against the idea of a national bank as Jefferson was: 

""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.""  - Thomas Jefferson  

We could not agree on whether Franklin or Jefferson deserved more credit for the original stance on defending the freedom to create currency. But since Franklin is more iconic we went with him for our design:

Do We Know What The Key Differences Will Be Between USDT And Goldman Sachs USDC?,"Goldman Sachs has announced it will be releasing a Usd backed coin similar to the already existing and widely used Usd Tether. 

With participation limited to USA only at the moment it is hard to find much if any information on it in the UK apart from press releases which are scarce of details. It leaves me wondering what the differences will be between Sachs Usd Coin and it's already established competitor usd Tether? 

Given the bad press Tether has been receiving recently in regards to lack of audits and rumours that it's backing account does not reflect the amount of coins now in circulation a usd backed coin with a highly established, all be it morally questionable corporation, at the helm might just be what cryptos need right now. 

This is a bold statement as having a decentralised currency propped up by the reputation of a centralised corporation like Sachs seems to go completely against the crypto ethos but if it helps new investors that are hesitant to get involved and also helps people who are currently invested but finding it hard or don't know how to convert back to fiat, or have little faith in companies that already offer this service, to do so without worrying. Something tether does not offer. 

This is assuming that the development of USDC will be a no expense spared project. It is already backed by Goldman Sachs and I think it's being developed by circle pay an app used for peer to peer payments that had been implemented through social media so I'm sure it will be.

"About to do something kinda crazy with my word seed, and I want some feedback before I jump.","Throwaway.

I want my Bitcoin completely un-tethered. I want no physical element to the long-term storage of my Bitcoin.

That means no hardware wallet, no paper wallet, no written word seed stashed in a book on a shelf, or in a safe, or in a safety deposit box. I want nothing that can be lost, destroyed, or stolen.

Okay, so here's my plan:

I have my 12-word seed memorized. Like *really* memorized.

But in the interest of safety and good practices, I'm going to take my 12-word seed, and *encrypt* it with a PGP private key.

The encrypted text containing the 12-word seed will then be stored at a well-known free email service, that requires 2-factor authentication. This is so if someone targets me specifically, it would be much harder to gain access than simply throwing a key logger on my PC to acquire all of my passwords.

The PGP private key required to *decrypt* the 12-word seed, will be stored at a *different* free email service that also requires 2-factor authentication.

For now, for simplicity, we will assume that I have no family or anyone to leave my Bitcoin to, and only want a solution for myself.

Legal action taken against Freewallet scam,"Its pretty clear an exit scam is coming after the latest slew of complaints on reddit.

After blocking access to my coins, and telling me all I needed to do was send them three photos, which I did plus a video, the scammers at Freewallet now tell me I have to provide a screenshot of my deposit transactions, which they already know cannot be done, since like so many people I used Shapeshift to get my Monero

They actually said to me, ""Show us a video of you logging into your Shapeshift account"".

What a joke. **NO ONE has a Shapeshift account**, as the [u/freewallet\_support](https://www.reddit.com/u/freewallet_support) scammers well know. An account is NOT needed or even suggested to use Shapeshift's service.

Freewallet does and says ANYTHING to make sure you cannot meet their bullsh\*t requirements.

Whatever request from them you satisfy, they simply make up a new one until you cant satisfy it. There are other examples of that on reddit from Freewallet's victims.

**We have identified more than one individual already**. They arent nearly as hidden as they like to think

In addition to major legal action, Google and Apple are receiving court subpoenas.

I gave them what they asked for and they only asked for more. There is no more I can possibly provide to them. Its now up to Freewallet how much trouble they want to be in

Mt. Gox wallet making OTC trades,"Makes perfect sense. I know a lot of short movements have been covered by the movement of btc from the infamous wallet(s).

I think the analysis is wrong. Big capital is currently building asset base, and it would not be currently cost-effective for them to make market purchases. They would be doing it through custodian services of Circle (incl Bitfinex) and recently Coinbase and Gemini.

On the other hand there was some long liquidation pressure due to futures expiring last week, and short traders trying to make money.

My hypothesis is that once accumulation is done, these new asset bases would start to slowly push market price up to comfortable lvls (it is irrelevent for big capital the actual unit price as they make money thru high vel. trades)

Also I think mining industry should be taken into account, as current lvls of cost effectivness are 8-8.6 k for big farms. So market and king makers will take this into account.

BITCOIN DOOMSDAY Theory,"Due to fear of BTC to take away their monetary control governments can secretly print more money to buy secretly maximum available BTC from whatever source they have.
This will result in increase in price of bitcoin which will further reduce the chances of majority of population buying bitcoin.
Those early adopters will see this as an opportunity to cash out their bitcoin buy selling it.
and as a part of the plan governments will take this opportunity to buy even more bitcoins by printing more money.
As above cycle repeats for years, finally following things will happen,
1. Governments will have majority of bitcoin holdings.
2. More fiat will enter the market which will cause massive inflation.
3. As very less bitcoins are available to buy at very high price, people will boycott bitcoin.
4. Bitcoin will remain as a zombie network.

What is Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Mining,"https://i.redd.it/xy2i9bfyxdy01.jpg

Heard of this thing called Bitcoin? Well, our guess here is yes you have. After all, Bitcoin, the world’s most popular Cryptocurrency has been making all the headlines in recent times as it reaches unimaginable heights in terms of value. At some point, the crypto cracked over $20,000 and this was just less than a year after it broke into the $1,000 mark in January. But the volatility of Bitcoin came to the fold after the crypto shed over 50&amp;#37; of its value at the beginning of 2018. Nonetheless, it’s still way higher compared to the seemingly modest $1,000 in value that was reported in January 2017.

The Bitcoin story though is much more than the attention\-grabbing headlines we have been accustomed to over the last few months. It’s an innovation that incorporates technology, math, currency, social dynamics, and economics. Bitcoin is a multifaceted concept. It’s highly dynamic and still evolving. This guide will help clarify a number of concepts associated with Bitcoin. It will also try to provide some answers to some of the most common Bitcoin questions.

The Back Story

Bitcoin was invented back in 2009. It’s not clear who exactly invented the crypto. The group or the person goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The purpose of Bitcoin according to its creator was simple. To create a new electronic cash system that will be fully decentralized with no central authority or central server. It took about two years for Nakamoto to fine tune the crypto. As soon as it was ready, he turned in the source code and domains for the currency to other Bitcoin community members.

What is Bitcoin?

Basically, Bitcoin is simply a digital currency. You cannot see it physically or touch it like the normal bills and coins. The currency is also decentralized. This means that there is no government agency or financial institution like a bank that controls it. The owners of Bitcoin are also anonymous. Instead of using Tax IDs and official names to connect people, Bitcoin uses encrypted keys. Bitcoin, unlike the normal currency, is not issued from top down through a centralized agency. It is in fact “mined” using an array of powerful computers that are interconnected online. But you can still use coin tokens to buy Bitcoin in an ICO.

How is Bitcoin Different from Traditional Currencies?

One similarity between Bitcoin and the traditional currencies is based on its application. The digital currency can be used to pay bills digitally the same way dollars and other currencies can. But there are a number of fundamental differences and here they are:

Decentralization

One of the most important characteristics of Bitcoin is its decentralized nature. In other words, there is no institution or agency that controls the currency. Bitcoin is maintained by a group of volunteer coders. It is run through an open network of supercomputers that are spread all over the world. Bitcoin is often an attractive prospect for people who don’t like the kind of government control and regulation that is associated with traditional currencies.

In addition to this, Bitcoin has solved the “double spending issue” that faces the use of digital currencies. This is a problem where digital assets can easily be copied and reused. Bitcoin uses an innovative combination of cryptography and economic incentives.

In a traditional fiat digital currency, the bank will be responsible for providing these capabilities. This simply means the banks retain control of how the currency is used. Bitcoin on the hand runs on an open network of computers to accomplish this task. The network is owned by no one and this makes the currency more decentralized compared to traditional money.

2. Limited Supply

Fiat currencies such as the Dollar, Euro, and others have unlimited supply. Central banks that control and regulate the currencies may decide to issue as many fiat currencies as they want and manipulate their values against each other. Eventually, the holder of the currency who has little to do with monetary policies of central banks will suffer from such actions.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a very tight supply system. There is an underlying algorithm that does this. Only a small amount of Bitcoin will trickle out every hour. The process will continue at a diminishing rate until a maximum of 21 million is reached. As an asset, Bitcoin is more attractive compared to fiat currency. Based on supply and demand theory, if demand for the coins rises and the supply remain as it is, the value of the currency will increase dramatically.

3. Pseudonymity

If you are sending an electronic payment through traditional means you will easily be identified as the sender. This is because anti\-money laundering laws require that banks and payment service providers verify transactions and the identity of the people making them. However, Bitcoin users get the benefit of some anonymity.

Since there is no central agency that can validate Bitcoin transactions used in smart contracts, users can send and receive coins without the risk of revealing their identities. When a user submits a transaction request, the protocol simply checks all the previous transactions associated with the sender to see whether he or she has enough coins to complete the transaction. The protocol will then assess whether the sender has the authority to send the coins. There is no need for the sender’s name or any other identification requirements.

In practice though, it is possible to identify users based on the address of their ERC20 wallets. There are also ways law enforcement officers can use to identify users. New laws are also mandating Bitcoin exchanges to identify and verify users. This is presumably designed to guard against the abuse of Bitcoin by criminals, terror organizations, and money launderers. The networks that aid transactions in Bitcoin exchanges are also open and every transaction can be easily monitored. Although there is still some level of anonymity especially compared to traditional fiat currencies, there is still a way of knowing who is sending and receiving the currencies.

4. Immutability

Unlike the electronic fiat transactions, transactions involving Bitcoin cannot be reversed. This is simply because there is no way to do so. Fiat transactions will often have a mediation process where someone can seek redress in case they want a payment reversed.

As for Bitcoin, once the transaction is recorded in the network and one hour has passed, then there is no way of reversing it. Although this might be a concern to some people, it is a clear indication that transactions on Bitcoin cannot be tampered with.

5. Divisibility

The smallest unit of Bitcoin is referred to as Satoshi. This is basically one hundred millionth of one Bitcoin. It’s such a small amount of value that it could easily facilitate micro\-transactions. This is not something that can be achieved using traditional fiat electronic currencies.

How to Mine Bitcoin

Bitcoin is mined through a combination of advanced math and record keeping. It works in a very simple yet sophisticated way. When someone sends a Bitcoin to someone else, that transaction will be recorded in the network. All other transaction made over a specific period of time will also be recorded in a “Block”. The computers that run the special Bitcoin mining software will then inscribe each transaction on a giant digital ledger. These blocks of records are known as “Blockchain”. This is basically a giant record of all the Bitcoin transactions that have been made and it will remain openly accessible forever.

In order to generate Bitcoin, miners will need to do one thing. They must convert these blocks into sequences of code often referred to as “hash”. This is not an easy thing. It requires specialized software and advanced state of the art hardware that can be energy intensive when used. In addition to this, there will be thousands of miners competing to generate the coins. Think of it as a group of chefs who are hurryingly trying to prepare a unique and coveted dish where only the first one to get it right gets paid. In other words, it is possible to do everything right in mining Bitcoin and still end up with nothing.

When the “hash” is generated, it will be placed at the end of the Blockchain. The miner who manages to complete these transactions will get 12.5 Bitcoins. Going by the Bitcoin value in February 2018, this will translate to roughly $100,000 in cash.

What Factors Determine The Value of Bitcoin?

The value of Bitcoin is determined by what people are willing to pay for it. It’s more like the stock market and the stock prices. When Satoshi Nakamoto created the Bitcoin protocol, he made sure that only a total of 21 million coins can be minded. So far, 12 million coins have already been mined. There is still a limited supply even with this. So many economic and mathematical theories that explain why Nakamoto decided to limit the production of coins to 21 million are out there.

The value of Bitcoin is not underpinned by any competitive company performance like stocks. There’s also no government agency at the helm that controls the supply of Bitcoin. This makes value totally open to intrinsic market conditions. Anyone can interpret the value they way they see fit. This concept is known as “price discovery” and has been blamed for the high volatility associated with Bitcoin.

There are so many Bitcoin millionaires at the moment. People who were early believers of the technology and those who began Bitcoin mining early have made good money over the years. Satoshi Nakamoto, in particular, has become a billionaire all thanks to this Bitcoin wave. The Winklevoss twins who got a $65 million payout from Facebook invested some early dollars into Bitcoin and will soon become the first Bitcoin billionaires after Nakamoto.

How to Buy Bitcoin

Before you decide to buy Bitcoin, you must know that there are risks involved. Well, if you don’t mind the risks, then you can buy Bitcoin through a number of established exchanges. Some of the common exchanges include CoinMama, Kraken, CEX, and Coinbase.

You can buy, sell, or store Bitcoin on all these platforms. Getting started with Bitcoin is also so simple. Some exchanges like Coinbase allow you to deposit cash on your virtual ERC20 wallet directly from your bank account or using PayPal. Once your virtual account is funded, you can now use the fiat currency to buy Bitcoin. It takes a few days for the balance to reflect on your Coinbase account.

What Can I Do With Bitcoin?

You can use Bitcoin to buy things online from over 100,000 merchants. You can also hold the coins, wait for the value to appreciate and sell.

Is Bitcoin Legal?

Bitcoin is legal at least for now. So far the digital currency has done well to avoid regulation by government agencies but this could change in the near future. As long as you are not using Bitcoin to accomplish illegal tasks, then you won’t have any problems with the law.

What Are The Risks Involved with Bitcoin?

The volatility of Bitcoin has to be one of the biggest challenges. At one point you can wake up with $100,000 in Bitcoin value and end up with $50, 000 at the end of the day or more. There is also the risk of theft. Hackers can break into your Bitcoin wallet and steal everything. Hackers do target exchanges though and there are so many cases where the loss in millions of dollars worth of coins has been reported.

What Other Cryptos Are Out There?

There are so many cryptocurrencies called altcoins. There are more than 1000 types of crypto in the market. Some of the common alternative coins include Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. The coins are not as valuable as Bitcoin but they are quite popular too.

What is Bitcoin Cash?

So, let’s talk about Bitcoin Cash. There was this disagreement among Bitcoin community members and miners as to what constitutes the appropriate size for a Blockchain. The argument couldn’t be settled. At the moment, traditional Bitcoin uses Blockchains of 1 MB while Bitcoin cash goes up to 8 MB. This debate is however far from over and it will pop up sometime in the future.

ELI5: Transaction processing after all coins have been mined,"My understanding of bitcoin is that the mining is actually, at a high level, just the processing of existing transactions. This is necessary because there is no centralized agency/organization who processes the transactions (sort of the key point of crypto in the first place). 

The reward for processing these transactions is bitcoin.

But bitcoin has a finite amount of coin that can be mined. So, what happens when there are no more coins to offer as a reward for processing the transactions? If there is no reward for using your computer(s) and electricity to process transactions, then eventually everyone will quit and nobody will be able to send coins anywhere.

Or am I completely missing something here?",1526566671,17/05/2018 14:17:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k4l8c/eli5_transaction_processing_after_all_coins_have/,1

The energy (and mining) problem,"The energy problem sums down to this: Bitcoin is using too much energy already, and if bitcoin's price increases, we will use even more energy. I own a mining contract with genesis mining, so I am part of the problem too :\(

This is a problem because it contributes to global warming, drives up the cost of electricity, and new miners don't really do anything. We have enough hashrate to be secure, and that is the only thing hashrate is good for.

There are a couple of solutions, but the easiest to implement solution probably involves some sort of modification over the difficulty of PoW in relation to price against the average cost of electricity. That would be a hardfork.

So, what would this modification look like? Right now, the difficulty requirement goes up linearly with new hashpower. If the difficulty requirement were instead to resemble a logarithmic graph, against the cost in joules to mine one bitcoin then the existing miners can get their roi, and new miners would be discouraged from entering the mining game.",1526568131,17/05/2018 14:42:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k4ri6/the_energy_and_mining_problem/,1

I have the building ready (unused) (I own it) to set up miners in, electricity is one of the cheapest in the world in the country, however Bitcoin and any crypto currencies are banned.


I was thinking what are the risks of me setting up this operation?

I am currently living in the U.K and I don't think the hardware will be easily accessible so I was thinking of taking some of the more costly hard to find equipment with me from the U.K to this country.

What happens if miners believe in a longer chain but full nodes don't?,"Simple example:

Software is upgraded for new consensus rules but miners don't upgrade. (They forget or are evil). Full nodes upgrade.

Let's say the new rule says that you can't send anything under 0.05 BTC. (just an example)

Alice makes a transaction to Bob for 0.03 BTC and sends it off. Miners mine it and accept it. Full nodes reject it. Now miners will be on a longer chain but full nodes will not accept the miners chain. What happens in this scenario?

Let's say Bob's address already had 5 BTC before receiving 0.03 BTC. When Bob later makes a transaction with 5.03 BTC does it get accepted or rejected? ie. Miner software would see it as a valid balance but full nodes would see him having a 5 balance only. So what happens to this transaction?

Does what happens depend on the % of full nodes vs miners? If so what happens if full nodes-to-miners is 80/20? What about 20/80? 

Say Bob's SPV client queries 10 nodes and the ratio of full nodes vs miners are the above scenarios. Does that affect things or will the SPV client be aware of consensus rules? I.e. does Bob's SPV client just choose the consensus rules it agrees with or does it choose the longest chain.

What happens if Alice &amp; Bob both don't run full nodes because they are your grandma and grandpa. Does the number of full nodes in the network help protect Alice &amp; Bob and how?

How do I contribute to the growth and adoption of Bitcoin?,"Hi guys,

I am a Web developer from Bangalore, India. I follow this sub regularly and I'm really impressed with power that bitcoin has to change this world for the better.

People in India are tired of corruption and the anger against banks definitely exists. Last year, people were restricted from using their own money that was kept in banks. There have also been scams after scams by major banks here. Recently there was no cash in ATMs and people had no money. 

People here need something like bitcoin. Bangalore is the tech capital of India and people here are really open minded and embrace new technology. The population of Bangalore is 10 million! Bitcoin has huge potential here. 

I'm wondering how I can help as a developer in making this reach businesses around me. Also, I would like to contribute as a programmer. I tried reading the white paper but found it a little hard to understand. I have strong programming skills in front end and back end web development(html, css, js, nodejs). I work as a freelance Web developer. Where do you think I can contribute my skills?! I want to play a role in this revolution because I really believe in it! People here are sick and tired of govts, regulation and corruption! We have no faith in them. It's the perfect time for decentralisation and free trade to take over. And I want to know how I can contribute. Are there companies I can work with? Any direction and links to resources would be great! May be it'll also help some one else like me.

Could a 9MB POISON PILL comment on Bcash / Bitcoin Cash network create havoc for miners &amp; exchanges?,"The **Bcash** chain didn't physically fork yet as no blocks \&gt; 8MB exist yet.

Wouldn't creation of a single transaction with a 9MB comment create havoc for Bitcoin Cash between that part of the infrastructure which has been upgrade and that which has not? Since consensus wasn't sought for this release, it is likely that there are exchanges/mines/wallets out there which have not upgraded, some of which might be significant players.

It looks to me like the **cost of such a POISON PILL transaction would be 1.83 BCH**.

Blockchain.info gives metadata_fetch_failed error,"Hi everyone!

I've been using blockchain.info for quite some time now and am overall satisfied with it. Some weeks ago I noticed that I can't login from my computer anymore. I have 2FA and email confirmation set up, and I can type both credentials in. I then get a small error message saying ""Metadata_fetch_failed"", and that's it.

From the phone I have no problem, so it's not like I can't access my bitcoins or so. I would just like to switch off 2FA to change my phone, but I need to do this from the desktop website.

I talked to customer support about it, but they are beyond unhelpful. After the classic ""did you try another browser"" they just stopped replying.

Has anyone experienced the same error or found a way around it? It's been quite some time already, and it seems it doesn't depend on my browser, operating system or machine - I tried it with a variety of them (Safari/Chrome/Firefox/Opera, macOS/Windows 10, 2 computers, different networks, cleared cache and cookies, tried incognito mode, etc).

How transaction fees and mining costs will disappear.. almost,"  Most new people coming into crypto trading wonder why there are  fees. And, of course, none of us like fees but once we understand our transactions can't happen without miners we accept the fees for what  they provide.  The thing is a lot of those fees are for overheads like electric bills.  So the power companies are getting a piece of the pie.  A big piece of the pie.  Resources better spent on more investment.  Not to mention the risk all miners face with power outages.  And having an effective back up supply like generators and batteries can be very expensive.

  As I'm sure most of you are all aware the criticism Bitcoin mining  and transactions has received over its alleged energy consumption. For  those who don't \- Energy consumption for 1 BTC transaction has been compared to 100,000 Visa transactions \- shown in this digiconomist  article \( [https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin\-energy\-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) \).  Probably bias.  Nonetheless, miners have to run their equipment which alone consumes large amounts of energy alone.  Keeping a facility cool enough  to run at optimal performances is another challenge miners face driving  up electric or gas bills. Regardless of the credibility for such claims, miners still face huge electricity bills and in turn Users are stung  for the services.  If a transaction cost miners a fraction of what it does today, transaction fees could also be a fraction.  We seek to remove fees almost completely \(apart from labor/services\).

**We can't be a decentralized currency system using centralized bank\-owned energy.**

[Image sourced from the article linked above.](https://i.redd.it/snaqa9qqggy01.jpg)

  There is a simple solution to this problem and that is renewable energy.  Not just any renewable energy but *unmetered* localized and truly clean energy, that any miner could possess and be literally **off\-the\-grid**  \(apart from WiFi of course\).  On that point, not to mention the security implications that will greatly benefit the crypto world with localized free energy...  GAEA has technology that will provide this *unmetered* electricity.  You may be wondering what we mean exactly. Its  not solar power or wind turbines \- that stuff just isn't efficient enough.  We have a Radiant Power Panel \([RPP](https://zpecoin.com/projects/radiant-power-panel/)\) which harnesses stellar radiation \- charging capacitors and batteries or even directly providing  energy.  Some may call us crazy and that may be true, but others love us.

How did the first cryptocurrency occur?,"The beginner in the world of cryptocurrency is now well\-known *Bitcoin*. The 2009 crackdown was created by unknown persons under the pseudonym** Satoši Nakamot**o, and this year it was discovered that it was Australian Krejg Rajt. Being a pioneer of digital money, he has introduced his revolutionary blocking system. Initially, the ""mining"" of coins was available to enthusiasts, so\-called ""early adopters"" of technology with the programmer's knowledge who started the *""diggin*g"" process. Later, all the other stakeholders who invested in processors and electrical power were joined to make the battle. The Bitcoin blocking system is programmed to make 21 million coins, currently, it is just over 16 million, and the estimate is that the last battle will not be ""fined"" before 2140. Today, the most demanding miners are mainly in so\-called mining pools. These are the warehouses of computers with huge processor power, which are in most cases deployed at locations where electricity is not expensive, otherwise, the process would not be paid due to the high cost of electricity. The biggest part of the battle is ""excavated"" today in the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Bitcoin mining system functions on the basis of* ""proof of wo*rk"".

How does merge mining work?,"## Mining 1 coin \(BTC\)

1. Miners try to find the nonce to solve for the difficulty.  If they do, then they submit the block to the blockchain.

## Merge mining

Here's how I think it works.  Can someone correct me if I'm wrong?

1. Let's say BTC and SBTC \(from rsk\) are merge mined.
2. Miners go through nonces the same as they would for BTC, except this time they are also checking to see if they solved SBTC's block.  
3. If this is true, how much more energy or computer power is used to merge mine?",1526594391,17/05/2018 21:59:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k85bn/how_does_merge_mining_work/,1

Buy a house/property with Bitcoin!,"Guys, this is HUGE! There was a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k0tch/bitcoin_booming/?st=jhb34fag&amp;sh=44e63c71) earlier here in r/bitcoin about [Climb real estate] (https://i.redd.it/4i3af9x6yby01.jpg) and there was a sign underneath it saying that they accept bitcoin. Now most of us might be like, oh yeah right, probably they are not serious, and to be honest this is what I thought too!

So I have decided to contact them via [chat](https://i.imgur.com/LlsVCO8.jpg), and right away they said that they will only accept US dollars. Was kinda disappointed at that point, but I thought it might be a robot who I was talking, so I decided to try via email. 

They have responded to my email pretty fast, and they confirmed that they indeed accept BTC for payment. 

I asked about the following:
-I’m curious of the procedure of a purchase in bitcoin. Could you please let me know in detail how it works?
-It’s very easy. I process up to $10M in Bitcoin into escrow account and close deals 7-10 days after.
The process is like this. You choose a house that you like and want. I process your Bitcoin through BitPay by invoice within 24 hrs. That money goes directly into escrow account and we close 7-10 days after. And after that you are the owner of a beautiful home

Now some of you may think that this is not that big of a news, but let me tell you that it defiantly is a big news. 

A real estate agent accepting a cryptocurrency is the **best thing** that can ever happen to crypto. 

Lets hope that this is one out of many that will (hopefully) follow. 

I'm currently not in a position to look for a house/property, but I know, that within the next few years, I will be, and my goal is to be able to buy my first house fully out of crypto.

Thank you for Climb real estate for helping adoption! ",1526595222,17/05/2018 22:13:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k88x9/buy_a_houseproperty_with_bitcoin/,1

Is Bitcoin losing its mojo? PayPal CFO says,"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-price-analysis-is-bitcoin-losing-its-mojo-paypal-cfo-says-merchants-are-less-interested-in-cryptocurrency-payments-201805171355


Bitcoin is in danger of sliding towards $8,000 but is supported above $8,250 during the intraday session on Thursday. There is a classic falling wedge pattern forming on the charts where Bitcoin price is trading lower highs and almost ranging lows. The buyers are have put their best foot forward to prevent major declines, however, BTC/USD is down a subtle 0.40% in the last 24 hours at the time of press.

PayPal launched Bitcoin payments back in 2015, however the CFO at the online payment guru, John Rainey says that at the moment the same merchants are not interested in taking virtual currency payments. Mr Rainey, while on CNBC’s Mad Money segment narrated how PayPal was among the first to allow merchants to accept cryptos years back. However, Rainey says “right now, we don't see a lot of interest from our merchants."" He added that this does not take away the support for Bitcoin:

""But if it is something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that.""

Bitcoin price is testing the prevailing resistance area at $8,300, although it is still in danger of sliding. The buyers are eyeing $8,500 (100 SMA), but in the meantime, $8,400 is enough. The 50 SMA will offer resistance as the price attempts to correct higher close to $8,350. On the downside, $8,250 is a short-term support zone, but further declines beyond this level will be halted at $8,200 and $8,100.

Can I reuse part of the blockchain for Bitcoin forks?,"Hello dear friends,

I am trying to claim coins from a few Bitcoin forks.

I was wondering if there is a way to avoid having to download 9 1/2 yeras of blockchain each time the wallet of the forked coin needs syncing.

Suppose I download the blockchain with Bitcoin core QT wallet up to August 2017 and then make a copy of the Bitcoin data directory, can I reuse that data to force a forked coin wallet to just reindex/rescan and download ONLY from August 2017?

If so, do I need to delete any coin-specific files each time?

If this feasible? If not, what is your recommended way to deal with syncing forked coin wallets if not by using the blockchain time and time again as fast as possible if an Electrum-like wallet is not available?

Holy Crap. I just figured out why some people are Bitcoiners and why some are BCHes,"so, most of you have probably heard of the whole Yanni and Laurel audio thing.  Here's a link that shows how it works and why some people hear Yanni and others Laurel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDiXQl7grPQ

Essentially, we are tuned into certain frequencies.  This is why we vibe (aka VIBRATE) to certain people and not others.  Everything is vibrating, everything is energy.  This is Science.  So, say you have two guitars in a room, you play the G string on one guitar, the other guitar's G string will actually start vibrating without you even touching it.  This is the law of resonance, or layman's terms ""vibing"" with another.  

Now, higher frequency people like bitcoin, because it is righteous.  BCHes are LOWer vibrating humans who are CYNICAL and assume the worst about others' intentions because in their little narrow world, that's what they would do if they were in the positions of others with power.  So they project their own bs upon others.  They are tuned into a very low frequency and resonate with BCH.  

I really hope this makes sense.  Of course, not many people have my level of awareness and I understand if you don't get it.  ",1526605182,18/05/2018 00:59:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k9b55/holy_crap_i_just_figured_out_why_some_people_are/,1

The bitcoin economy,"Over the last three decades commerce has changed tremendously with the introducion of the internet. We were able to connect seamlessly across the globe to trade goods and services. 

During this process we established very robust platforms and banking systems to drive web commerce. Naturally, each region focused on making it possible to interchange global currencies for the most part, but the dollar was the main currency used for web commerce as the USA lead the world in this revolution.

Obviusly, there are a lot of imperfections and friction related to currency exchanges and fluctuations. Also, banking institutions have acted as a trusted third party to maintain transactional continuities and provide guarantees to both buyers and sellers.

The next logical step is a system of trust that can guarantee both transactional security and continuity, where a network of value is established and its accessible to anyone with internet connectivity and the right software. This system incentivizes the network to invest in hardware that can most efficiently maintain the network’s value. The value is added as the processing speed at which the transactional continuity and trust grows over the years.

Bitcoin to use 0.5% of world’s electricity by end of 2018,"Many Bitcoin detractors use ""energy consumption"" as their major reason to criticize Bitcoin. 

But what they fail to mention is:

2. Other non-essential modern conveniences use a lot more electricity. Home computers, entertainment, dishwashers, TVs ... etc all use a lot more electricity than Bitcoin.
3. It's relatively easy to quantify Bitcoin's energy consumption, however other financial industries may (and probably do) use a lot more electricity/energy.
4. Most consumer technology advancements increase the need for electricity. Lightbulbs, washing machines, toasters, vacuum cleaners, computers, telephone ... etc have all permanently increased demand for electricity.

btc-e locked me out for no reason. Now wex.nz won't let me back in despite sending insane amounts of proof of identity.,"I  had an account with btc\-e. My email gets deleted so I log in to change  my email. I log in with email and password. I click change email and  btc\-e sends a link to my old email address to click on and verify. I'm  like, fuck, that was deleted already. as bitcoin only worth small amount  back then I didn't care enough. I know stupid right? I only had one  coin. So I while logged in contact customer service and get broken  english. They tell me to click link in email. I'm arguing with them for a  week and then they change my password routinely for my own safety. So  now I need to click a link in email to change password. So now I can't  log in and get my address and take a screenshot. Which if I had today  would apparently be proof I am the account owner and they would let me  back into my account with new email address and password. I have so far  offered the following as proof the account is mine. Photo id front and  back,ssn,Account balance, Date of last account balance change and  amount, old email, old password, the ip address I have now is the same  that I had then, help ticket from btc\-e I had copy and pasted for some  reason, the userid of my btc\-e account, approximate date of initial  deposit of btc. The list goes on. And they will not let me back in my  account without a screenshot of a transaction from the blockchain.  Sending me this reply every time 

Understand that we do not need your old password, this is not proof.  You need to send confirmation of the deposit \(one or several  transactions\): screenshots from the mail, screenshots from payment  systems, a screenshot from the wallet, from which you make deposits or  other confirmation.

But while it has so far managed to meander its way through an uneven landscape marked with [high\-profile heists](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/a-brief-history-of-bitcoin-hacks-and-frauds/), [online black markets](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/), [inner feuds among developers](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/business/dealbook/the-bitcoin-believer-who-gave-up.html) and [regulatory backlash](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/technology/bitcoin-sec-cryptocurrency/index.html), it now faces another obstacle: energy consumption.",1526619296,18/05/2018 04:54:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kan2e/how_to_solve_the_bitcoin_energy_consumption/,1

Don't invest if you don't trust in Bitcoin. Price is unimportant in the long run. The real value of it through adoption and real-world usage is sky-rocketing since months.,"Just thought I'd share what I see as the most important lesson I've learned since I started to get Bitcoin.  
  
Its current price is not its value.  
  
Price is only temporary and will always adjust to value in the end.  
  
You can get a grasp of Bitcoins real value everytime you see news about which new country or organisation is adopting bitcoin. Everytime you see some random sign that says ""accepting Bitcoin now"". Hell, you can get credit cards by now that you just use like the normal ones and in the background every payment is paid from your wallet instead of your bank account.  
  
But most importantly I learned to bother less about how much fiat my coins are worth because getting Bitcoin should be about having Bitcoin to use in the future because for me there is now doubt about it replacing our current money system.  
  
It already is.  
  
So better be honest to yourself. Do you really trust in Bitcoin and are willing to ignore the price going down because you see its true value?  
Or are you just after something to make money with. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that but the problem is if you don't put value&gt;price than you're in for a lot of sleepless nights.  
  
Have a good day everybody. And keep sharing all those pictures about random local stores accepting BTC now :)",1526631337,18/05/2018 08:15:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kbkad/dont_invest_if_you_dont_trust_in_bitcoin_price_is/,1

Mt Gox Coin Movement Telegram Notifications (Plus Tether Printing),"Hello r/Bitcoin,


We're the guys who posted about the Mt. Gox coins moving last week.


Since the post kinda took off in here, we've had a bunch of users ask for access to our bot for notifications when the coins move. Also, we kinda feel like we owe you one, considering the news scoops provided on r/Bitcoin and other crypto subreddits are better than those provided by an army of VAs!


Therefore, we've added the following to our telegram channel:

* Instant notifications when Mt. Gox BTC coins move
* Instant notifications when Tether prints fiat, including via the ERC20 contracts

Disclaimer: Curated news from our site is posted to the channel also.


Hope some of you find this useful, we're trying to provide real value in our channel and have a few more nifty tools lined up. We're also open to any suggestions.


You can find our channel via the website (blokt.com), automod doesn't seem to like TG links.",1526631980,18/05/2018 08:26:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kbluu/mt_gox_coin_movement_telegram_notifications_plus/,1

"Was at Bloxpo yesterday and woah, thank you everyone! But one thing became apparent to us. . .","A great first event of Bloxpo. After attending the conference the market can do what it wants for all that I'm concerned. I feel so confident in the cryptocommunity and it's dreams and ambitions to grow together understanding that this is just the starting faze of something amazing for the entire world. 

But one thing was also apparent. The real-life crypto-community outside of cryptocurrency desperately need places to meet. We need more hubs and portals for people to meet, discuss, brainstorm and build together. Without the physical representation of a Crypto-community outside of all the projects that passionate people are building for us we are just people staring at a screen. 

We cant just invest and then complain when the market doesnt go bullish. Without a physical representation of a cryprocommunity, nothing will happen in the longterm and we can say byebye to a mainstream future because as we all know, if people can avoid it, they will avoid the unknown. We all get stuck in the illusion of it being a bit intimidating or even frightening to learn something new and controversial or even meeting new people. But after scary comes YaYie! Personal growth. So what if we could create the environment to solve this little problem of initial fear?

Anyway! We had so much fun and at the end of the conference we were a group of like 5 people who created this little offline Telegramchat (Roskilde) lol. Together we were just trying to solve this challenge with atleast a tiny step in the moment. This offlinechat was occuring in real-life, us just standing in a circle with this woman Noreen who had this amazing and fun energy. None of us really knew each other and she just ripped through this initial barrier and so we all had a great time together. So we ended up with a couple of these concepts like popupshops, and +1 conferences. But waking up today I want to create hubs now too!?

Wouldnt that be a fun concept for a crypto?

Creating a token that you use at these Hubs that help us as a community to grow? Where you can buy this Hubtoken with the Ethos wallet i.e. or any other effective solution for that matter and pay for stuff with it on events, at hubs, at popupshops etcetc!? 

Comon' guys all of these amazing crypto teams and projects and we are forgetting about our own passion and our own participation. We need to share the energy and passion with each other and especially with the people who have not caught on to crypto yet!?🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕",1526639839,18/05/2018 10:37:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kc6ka/was_at_bloxpo_yesterday_and_woah_thank_you/,1

"Bitcoin IS a destructive waste of energy, but that doesn't matter","Recently the media has enjoyed calculating just how much energy is wasted mining Bitcoin. The responses here so far have not covered my personal interpretation of the issue.

First, it is undeniable that exponentially increasing hash power is terrible for the environment. It doesn't matter how efficient mining becomes, or what the power source is. Renewable energy cannot help here because there is no limit to the energy demand - compared to, say, household heating.

The problem with this criticism of Bitcoin is that global climate change is all or nothing, and it doesn't matter so much which sources in particular get us there. And we are getting there.

By any measure, scientific consensus is that we are now on an unstoppable path of carbon dioxide increase. Although emissions are improving in the developed countries, there are billions of people who would eat more beef given the chance.

To understand just how large this problem is, let's talk about removing an equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere as we emit annually, so as to balance things. It turns out we would need to plant all arable land on Earth with a fast growing grass, and farm kelp in several percent of the ocean surface. Basically this is impossible.

Let me say that again: our current emissions, even without further increase, are impossible to recover with photosynthesis. There are potentially some alternative approaches with direct carbon capture that are more efficient, but we are essentially past the point of fixing this problem, and bitcoin has nothing to do with this.

It seems to me that Bitcoin energy use is particularly noteworthy for some people because it jarringly exposes the root of the issue: we cannot solve urgent, basic problems in the world because, generally, governments are incompetent. A truly terrifying thought, considering they control the money supply...

A Guide to Keeping Keys Offline Using Armory +rPi,"![](https://www.crypto-news.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/armory_logo.jpg)


Hi Redditors.

I am going to post in this thread my experiences in getting my Desktop (Debian) machine running Armory in watch-only mode, and coupling that with an offline Raspberry Pi (which holds my private keys) for signing the transactions previously made in watch-only mode. 

I actually compiled Armory from source directly on my Pi. This guide is probably more for the bitcoin 'power user', as to run Armory online, and broadcast the signed transactions, you need to have a bitcoin full node running (bitcoind).

Basic requirements:
 - Online machine - running a full node (bitcoind)
 - Raspberry Pi - I used an old Pi 1 Model B with just 512Mb memory, and 2 USB slots.
 - 2x USB thumb-drives. One for wallet backups, the other for transferring unsigned tx's to the rPi, and signed tx's back to the Desktop.

Aimed-for Setup:
 - Armory 0.96.4 for the Raspberry Pi 1, Model B (512Mb RAM, 2xUSB)
   (compiled from github sourcecode on the Pi itself!)
 - Using the Pi as an offline complement to a Debian Desktop ""watch-only"" Armory install.
 - Desktop Debian Armory watch-only talks to my full node, bitcoind, which is also on the Debian desktop.

I'll post the guide in digestible sections...

# Section 1

I should begin by saying I installed source code from git, and got Armory to build the DB on my desktop initially, WITHOUT creating a wallet.. 
(This allowed me to debug what was going on a little!)

I am using Armory 0.96.4 

Desktop:  Debian 9, Dual-Core, 2Gb Memory, 2Gb Swap.

Pi     :  Pi 1, Model B (512Mb RAM, 2x USB, Ethernet)
     

Go to Bitcoin.org, select Armory.. 

It leads to a Download from Git:

https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases


Followed the procedure for Linux Debian verify code, compile, install, all straight-forward.. 

Began by running bitcoind, and telling Armory where to find it. This is the command I used,
obviously it was all on one line and didn't include the arrows/explanations!:

    python ArmoryQt.py \
    --satoshi-datadir=/BlockChain/chain20180414/blocks \     # &lt;-----(where my bitcoind blocks live)
    --datadir=/ArmoryDataDir/   \                # &lt;-----(this is instead of ~/.armory)
    --dbdir=/ArmoryDataDir/databases      # &lt;-------(again, non std. place used for Armory's databases.. my choice.)


So, on the Desktop, after the initial ""build databases""  

(NB the initial ""Build Databases"" took about 1.5h and my two CPUs were maxed the whole time, Temps up to 62C. Not ideal; Im not in a rush!)

I then wanted to import a watch-only wallet.

Before I did this, I took a full backup of the Armory data dir: 

/ArmoryDataDir/ 

(or ~/.armory in a default installation).

I'd hate to have to make Armory do another full sync with the bitcoind node!

# Section 2

Next step:  offline wallet (with Private Keys) is on a Raspberry Pi.

I downloaded the source and managed to compile it on the pi itself! 
:)

Though there were some gymnastics needed to setup the Pi.

My Pi is running Raspbian based on Wheezy.. quite old!

I did the following on the Pi:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade (&lt;---took about an hour!)
    apt-get install autotools-dev 
    apt-get install autoconf
 

Then I followed the instructions exactly as I had done for my Debian Desktop machine, EXCEPT:

I had to increase the Pi's swap space. I upped it from 100Mb to 400Mb.

The compilation took 7 hours, and my poor SD card got a thrashing.

But after compilation, I put the Swap back to 100Mb and Armory runs ok with about 150Mb of memory (no swap needed).


Swap increase on the Pi:

use your favourite editor, and open the file /etc/dphys-swapfile

add/change the following line:

    CONF_SWAPSIZE=400

Then, REBOOT the Pi:

    sudo shutdown -h -P now



Once the compilation was done on the Pi, put the swap back, rebooted and created an Armory wallet.

I added manual entropy and upped the encryption 'time' from 250ms to 2500ms - since the Pi is slow, but I'll be happy to wait for more iterations in the Key Derivation Function.


Once the wallet was created, it obviously prompts you for backup. 

I want to add a private key of my own (i.e. import), so don't do the backup until this is over.

I import my Private Key, and Armory checks that this corresponds to a Public Key, which I check is correct.

This is the point now where the Pi storage medium (e.g an SD card) has to be properly destroyed if you ever get rid of it.


I had thought that now would be a good time to decide if your new wallet will generate Segwit receiving addresses,
and also addresses used to receive 'change' after a transaction.. 

But it seems Armory WON'T let you switch to P2SH-P2WPKH unless your Armory is connected to a node 
offering ""WITNESS"" service. 

Obviously, my Pi is offline and will never connect to a node, so the following will not work on the Pi:

 x Use File --&gt; Settings --&gt; Fee and address types.

 x Set the ""Preferred Receive Address Type"" to P2SH-P2WPKH 

 x Also Set the ""Change Address"" to P2SH-P2WPKH for left-over loose change!


NB: I thought about setting this on the Debian ""watch-only"" wallet, but that would surely mean doom, as 
the Pi would not know about those addresses and backups might not keep them.. who knows...

So, end result:- no segwit for me just yet in my offline funds.

--If anyone can offer a solution to this, I'd be very grateful--


# Section 3

Ok, now this is a good point to back up your wallet on the Pi. It has your imported keys. 
I choose a Digital Backup - and put it on a USB key, which will never touch the internet and will be stored off-site. I also chose to encrypt it, because I'm good with passwords..

NB: The Armory paper backup will NOT back up your imported private keys, so keep those somewhere if you're not sweeping them.
It would be prudent to have an Armory paper backup anyway, but remember it will likely NOT help you with that imported key.


Now for the watch-only copy of the wallet. I want to get the ""watch-only"" version onto my Desktop Debian machine.

On the Pi, I created (exported to a USB key) a ""watching-only"" copy of my wallet.

I would use the RECOMMENDED approach, export the ""Entire Wallet File"".

As you will see below, I initially exported only the ROOT  data, which will NOT capture the watching-only part of the Private Key I entered manually above (i.e. the public Key!).


Now, back on the Debian Desktop machine...

I stopped all my crontab jobs; just give Armory uninterrupted CPU/memory/disk...

I also stopped bitcoind and made a backup prior to any watch-only wallet being imported.

I already made a backup of Armory on my Desktop, before any wallet import. 

(this was needed, as I made a mistake.. see below) 




So on the Debian Desktop machine, I begin by firing up bitcoind. 

my command for this is:

    ./bitcoind -daemon -datadir=/BlockChain/chain20180414 -dbcache=400 -maxmempool=400

# Section 4

I try running Armory like this:

(I'm actually starting Armory from a script - StartArm.sh)

Inside the script StartArm.sh, it has the line:

    python ArmoryQt.py --ram-usage=4  --satoshi-datadir=/BlockChain/chain20180414/blocks --datadir=/ArmoryDataDir/ --dbdir=/ArmoryDataDir/databases


I know from bitter experience that doing a scan over the blockchain for a new wallet takes a looong time and a lot of CPU, and I'd like it to play nicely; not gobble all the memory and swap and run my 2xCPUs both at 100% for four hours...

So... I aim to run with --ram-usage=X and --thread-count=X

(For me in the end, X=1 but I began with X=4)



I began with --ram-usage=4   (&lt;--- = 4x128Mb)

The result is below...

    TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects





It didn't recognise the ram-usage and carried on, crippling my Debian desktop PC.

This is where it gets dangerous; Armory can gobble so much memory and CPU that the windowing environment can cease up, and it can take over 30 minutes just to exit nicely from bitcoind and ArmoryDB.

So, I ssh to the machine from another computer, and keep an eye on it with the command

    ""free -h""

I'd also be able to do a ""sudo reboot now"" if needed from here.

# Section 5

So, trying to get my --ram-usage command recognised, I tried this line (added quotes):

    python ArmoryQt.py --ram-usage=""4""  --satoshi-datadir=/BlockChain/chain20180414/blocks --datadir=/ArmoryDataDir/ --dbdir=/ArmoryDataDir/databases

But no, same error...

    Traceback (most recent call last):

    pargs.append('--ram-usage=' + ARMORY_RAM_USAGE)
    TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects


# Section 6

So, I edit the Armory python file SDM.py:

    if ARMORY_RAM_USAGE != -1:
       pargs.append('--ram-usage=4')
    #COMMENTED THIS, SO I CAN HARDCODE =4
    # ' + ARMORY_RAM_USAGE)

Running it, I now have acknowledgement of the --ram-usage=4:

    (WARNING) SDM.py:400 - Spawning DB with command: /BitcoinArmory/ArmoryDB --db-type=""DB_FULL"" --cookie --satoshi-datadir=""/BlockChain/chain20180414/blocks"" --datadir=""/ArmoryDataDir/"" --dbdir=""/ArmoryDataDir/databases"" --ram-usage=4


Also, even with ram-usage=4, it used too much memory, so I told it to quit.

It took over 30 minutes to stop semi-nicely. The last thing it reported was:

    ERROR - 00:25:21: (StringSockets.cpp:351) FcgiSocket::writeAndRead FcgiError: unexpected fcgi header version

But that didn't seem to matter or corrupt the Armory Database, so I think it's ok.



So, I get brave and change SDM.py as below, and I make sure my script has a command line for --ram-usage=""ABCDE"" and --thread-count=""FGHIJ""; the logic being that these strings ""ABCDE"" will pass the IF criteria below, and my hardcoded values will be used...

    if ARMORY_RAM_USAGE != -1:
       pargs.append('--ram-usage=1')
    #COMMENTED THIS, SO I CAN HARDCODE =1 
    # ' + ARMORY_RAM_USAGE)
    
    if ARMORY_THREAD_COUNT != -1
      pargs.append('--thread-count=1')
    #COMMENTED THIS, SO I CAN HARDCODE =1
    #' + ARMORY_THREAD_COUNT)



So, as usual, I use my script and start this with:
    ./StartArm.sh

(which uses command line:)

    python ArmoryQt.py --ram-usage=""ABCDE"" --thread-count=""FGHIJ"" --satoshi-datadir=/BlockChain/chain20180414/blocks --datadir=/ArmoryDataDir/ --dbdir=/ArmoryDataDir/databases

(this forces it to use my hard-coded values in SDM.py...)


So, this is the command which it reports that it starts with:

    (WARNING) SDM.py:400 - Spawning DB with command: /BitcoinArmory/ArmoryDB --db-type=""DB_FULL"" --cookie --satoshi-datadir=""/BlockChain/chain20180414/blocks"" --datadir=""/ArmoryDataDir/"" --dbdir=""/ArmoryDataDir/databases"" --ram-usage=1 --thread-count=1


Again, this is where it gets dangerous; Armory can gobble so much memory and CPU that the windowing environment can cease up. So I ssh to the machine and keep an eye on it with:

    ""free -h""

# Section 7

So, on the Debian Desktop PC, I inserted the USB stick with the watch-only wallet I exported from the Pi.

Start Armory...

Import ""Entire Wallet File"" watch-only copy.

Wait 4 hours..

YAY!!!

After running Armory for about 30m, the memory usage dropped by 400m... wierd...

It took ~2 hours to get 40% completion.

After 3.5 hours it's almost there...



The memory went up to about 1.7Gb in use and 900Mb of Swap, but the machine remained fairly responsive throughout, apart from a few (10?) periods at the start, where it appeared to freeze for 10-30s at a time.

(That's where my ssh session came in handy - I could check the machine was still ok with a ""free -h"" command)




Now, I can: 

Create an unsigned transaction on my Desktop, 

Save the tx to USB stick, 

Move to the Pi, 

Sign the tx,

Move back to the Desktop,

Broadcast the signed tx. 



# Section 8

My initial Mistake: 

This caused me to have to roll-back my Armory database, using the backup. so you should try to avoid doing this..

On the Pi, I exported only the ROOT data, which will NOT capture the watching-only part of the Private Key

It is RECOMMENDED to use the Digital Export of Entire Wallet File from the Pi when making a watch-only copy.
If you just export just the ""ROOT data"", not the ""Entire Wallet File"", you'll have problems if you used an imported Private Key in the offline wallet, like I did. 

Using the ROOT data text import, after it finished... my balance was zero.
So,. I tried a Help-&gt;Rescan Balance
(Restart Armory, takes 1minute to get back up and running)
No Luck. Still zero balance.

So, I try Rescan Databases.. This will take longer.
Nah.. no luck.


So, I tried again, thinking it might be to do with the fact that I imported the text ""root data"" stuff,
instead of following the (Recommended) export of watching-wallet file.

So, I used my Armory backup, and wound back the ArmoryDataDir/ to the point before the install of the (zero balance) wallet.
(you should not need to do this, as you will hopefully use the RECOMMENDED approach of exporting the ""Entire Wallet File""!)

"Is it just me, or does accepting and spending Bitcoin/Crypto make your accounting/bookkeeping damn near impossible, at least in the US?","I've been banging my head against this for weeks. I run a small crypto consulting business specializing in mining. Nevermind the near impossibility of calculating your exact tax liability unless you use just one exchange - just good old fashioned bookkeeping is pretty much impossible if you have any inclination towards accepting raw crypto.

The only accounting software that even supports BTC as a currency directly to begin with is Quickbooks Online - and they round everything to two decimal places. Which essentially rounds every transaction to the nearest $100, and transactions below $50 round down to $0 - so it refuses to accept/import them. Which makes that functionality **completely useless.**

So of course I can manually enter the dollar value of the bitcoin when I receive it - which is multiple times a day in small amounts due to mining. And then when if you want to directly spend it....just forget about it. Its not worth it. You'll never be able to keep your books straight ever again, because you have to value the amount spent in USD, not BTC.  

Literally the only viable option if I want to keep my books straight is to not accept crypto through anything but a payment processor that will immediately convert it to fiat. And that's not what anyone here wants to do. 

Seriously I can't overemphasize how much of a barrier to adoption this is to business. Its not just about paying the right amount of tax - it makes it impossible to understand the financial state and health of your business when half of your income and assets can't be included in accounting software.

And at the end of the day this is nothing more than a computer science problem - its just an impossible burden for a human being. Anyone who writes a plugin to effectively integrate Bitcoin into QBO is my hero forever. Ok, rant over....but seriously you guys, this is like a ridiculously huge problem for adoption. You can do everything in the world to convince people to spend it, but it doesnt matter if business reality effectively forces businesses not to accept it.",1526667359,18/05/2018 18:15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kfakq/is_it_just_me_or_does_accepting_and_spending/,1

Long term Bitcoin security main chain,"Hi,

Will Bitcoin remain secure when block rewards diminish and we move so much of the fee potential in side chains?

In the short term future probably not a big thing but I am not sure about the long term. I can see there will most likely always be some need to do on chain transactions, but is there any math in whether this will be enough?

Also is there some form of popular opinion among Bitcoiners whether eventually it would be fine to increase the block size a bit and if not what are the main reasons to not do this? (when hardware progressed to the level that a block size increase would not harm the barrier of entry to run nodes). I was thinking maybe a block size increase would decrease the total fees paid on chain to secure the network but I have no idea how this would play out.

Thank you",1526668453,18/05/2018 18:34:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kfffx/long_term_bitcoin_security_main_chain/,1

Buying bitcoins - an email sent to friends,"Bitcoin is a network protocol that is not owned by anybody. No individual, government, or other institution has control over it. It was created by an anonymous person that disappeared after its inception. From such perspective, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency with such property (decentralized).

As part of the protocol Bitcoin allows you to exchange the underlying currency (Bitcoins) in a way that

* a) You have complete control over the bitcoins you hold - no bank, government can seize it from you
* b) There are no limitations or restrictions on when and with whom you can transact. If you want to send Bitcoins to people in Iran, North Korea or Venezuela, you can do that

Note that this is in stark contrast with the banking system which can always freeze your assets in time of crisis and can always impose all kinds of limitations on how you can use your money.

There are ever only going to be 21 million bitcoins thus, they are scarce. This is in opposition to standard currencies (EUR, USD) that are regularly printed and hence lose value over time.


**Where should I buy it?**

There are many ways to get scammed in this space so I strongly suggest being extremely cautious. Personally I recommend using Bitstamp as it has a good track record. It is crucial to send the purchased coins from Bitstamp to your local wallet as to have full control of your Bitcoins. I suggest using the mobile wallet Samourai. If you need help buying or setting up the wallet let me know.


**Why buying now?**

At the end of 2017 and early 2018 the space was fraught with speculative mania and people trying to get rich fast. While there is still a lot of bubble frenzy the whole situation stabilized a bit and is a good time to make prudent stabs at the market. Violent downswings are still to be expected. Hence its wise to buy small amounts over a longer time frame.


**Why buy Bitcoin?**

If your intention is to get rich quick then don't bother with Bitcoin. There are many better opportunities. If, on the other hand, you feel like the current financial system of high debt, inflation, and government bailouts is unsustainable and would like to participate and empower something different, then you should consider putting a negligible amount of money into Bitcoin.

To quote Pether Thiel -  ‘Owning Bitcoin Is a Hedge Against the World Falling Apart’


**What about other cryptocurrencies?**

99.9% of other cryptocurencies are scams and pump and dump schemes. The word blockchain is a marketing buzzword used to persuade naive investors. The remaining 0.01% cryptocurrencies that are ""legitimate"" are less secure and more centralized. Other than Bitcoin, there is currently no other innovation in this space, despite all the hype. There may be better short/long term investments but again, this mail is not about that.

Buying bitcoin - an advice sent to friends,"The following text was sent to my friends. I figured its relevant for this sub.

I suggest you don't follow the following suggestion blindly, rather inform yourself about it, make your own opinions and follow that.

I am currently buying a fixed amount of Bitcoin on a monthly basis. I believe its a good move to buy even small amounts (say 50E,100E) every month. I believe the price
can go much much lower (a 90% decline is likely) so if one cannot commit to buying every month for at least one year and then hold it for 3-5 years, then I don't recommend doing it.

Following are some common questions people ask.

"Price of A Single Bitcoin to Reach 1 Million Dollars, If With 100 Million Bitcoin Users","**I Recently Think that The Price of A Single Bitcoin Will Reach 1 Million Dollars, If With 100 Million Bitcoin Users**

Bitcoin is very useful to bypass any intermediary and is the most efficient way of engaging in peer\-to\-peer \(p2p\) transactions. If the number of bitcoin users is *n*, there will* be n\(n\-*1\)/2 connections for p2p transaction, so the value of the bitcoin network is proportional to **the sq**uare of the number of the connected users; while the value of a centralized network project is directly proportional to the number of users.

Three years ago, the number of Bitcoin users was around millions, and the price of one single Bitcoin was about one hundred dollars. At present, the number of Bitcoin users reaches the level of 10\-millions, and the price of bitcoin achieves a 100\-fold increase correspondingly. If this model of valuation is reliable, then when the number of users reaches the level of 100\-billions, the price of one bitcoin will be one million dollars.

Based on this valuation model, the value of one blockchain project with peer\-to\-peer network is proportional to the square of the number of its users, unlike the traditional Internet or centralized platforms whose value is in proportion to the number of users. If to utilize the traditional measures for the valuation, the value of block chain projects will be seriously underestimated.",1526673812,18/05/2018 20:03:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kg2ts/price_of_a_single_bitcoin_to_reach_1_million/,1

"Bitcoin, the advantage of not being associated with anything","The legendary Warren Buffett once said Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it's not backed by a government or anything.  Unlike stocks that is based on the company performance.  I think Warren Buffett  pretty much nailed it on exactly why Bitcoin is so great and it was unfortunate he didn't realize this.  

A currency or any asset that's linked to a government or bank or an enterprise becomes dependent on these entities.  Through out history we have seen too many cases where a country and its government can collapse, a banking industry or an enterprise can fail and so does the linked currency or assets.  Even the superpower United States could not escape economic recessions and devalue of USD over time.  So how is that a good thing that a currency is backed by anything or is dependent on anything?  It is not because no one can guaranty a government won't fail, won't print more money which cause inflation and devalue the currency.  No one can guaranty an enterprise doing very well today will continue to do well in the future.  So why is Bitcoin so great?  

Bitcoin is so great because it is precisely what Warren Buffett said. Bitcoin is not backed by anything, it's not linked to any government, banks, or enterprise.  It is an independent distributed network owned by people everywhere.  For this reason, Bitcoin is immune to collapsing government, failing bank or enterprises, or even war.  Bitcoin is separated from all of that and that's why it is a great hedge against everything else and a great store of value.  

People will slowly catch on to this.  In the stock market you can be wiped out completely because some company failed miserably.  You have no control over that.  Your wealth went to zero because of that company's failure.  In a fiat currency it can devalue so fast due to the actions of a government, and yet again, you have no control over that.  But in Bitcoin you have 100% control because it's value is what you and everyone else place in it.  We the people of the world have the sole power to destroy Bitcoin when we no longer place trust in it.  That's the only way Bitcoin will go to zero.  The world government can ban it, make it illegal, but it will never destroy Bitcoin as long as people place value in it.  This is why Bitcoin is so great because it is the people of this world that gives Bitcoin value and nothing else.

The rise of Bitcoin value over the last 9 years is proof that more and more people place trust in Bitcoin. That's the true value of Bitcoin is because people want to hold on to it.  The volatility we are seeing is because of new people not understanding Bitcoin and they were not buying because they place trust in it but they were chasing quick bucks.  But Bitcoin doesn't fall to zero because more and more people are becoming educated and aware of how powerful Bitcion really is.  The ability to become independent of everything else.  The ability to take control into your own hands.  Another quote by Warren Buffett, and many other popular figures saying it's what the next guy willing to pay for it.  Ding ding ding, Bingo!

Most cost efficient way for Canadians to buy crypto! Shakepay,"As most Canadians, I have struggled to find a way to buy crypto in Canada. And as most people i made my first purchase using Coinbase, which has horrible fees, and high rates to actually buy. I started using QuadrigaCX but now the only bank that allows interac which was RBC has put a ban starting on may 15. 

1. I was introduced to an app called SHAKEPAY, and here is my experience so far.

2. Made an account and was verified in 6 mins. 

3. There only way to deposit CAD is through email transfer \- took 3 mins to send and have the funds deposited in my shakepay account.

4. Ready to buy bitcoin, this is where i was impressed. i noticed shakepay has the best damn rate for bitcoin, at the time of purchase, **1 BTC cost 10244.90 CAD FEES INCLUDED, vs Coinbase which cost 10691.10 CAD FEES NOT INCLUDED.**

SHAKEPAY HAS THE BEST RATE I HAVE EVER SEEN ON ANY EXCHANGE TO BUY. PERIOD.

now its also noted it has the worst rate to sell bitcoin as well, BUT it has no fees when transferring BTC to any exchange, so i simply buy on shakepay and transfer to binance or quadriga if i want to sell or trade.

im not affiliated with shakepay in anyway, i just want to help any canadains who are interested in buying crypto to get started. I know how hard it was for me, but i finally figured out the most cost effiecent way without paying tons of fees or overpay for crypto. If you are interested in getting started or giving this company a try, you can use my referral link and get free $5, msg me if interested.",1526680446,18/05/2018 21:54:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kgtps/most_cost_efficient_way_for_canadians_to_buy/,1

Let's face it's most probable that btc price will flop on the long run...,"sorry my fucked up english but if you have btc or any other ccurrency you better start asking to pay in ccurrency on every shop, coffe, bar, restaurant or wherever you go. 
Let's face it's most probable that btc price will flop on the long run if we don't use it. I would say it's guaranteed but hey who knows.
I'm not worried if the market crash right now because btc is the most brilliant app for blockchain so I think it will hold value somehow. Yes blockchain will help the industry to get better and faster ways to get money, but nothing like sending money over the internet and nobody can tell you what to do with your money.
So if you are sick of non sense projects popping out like mushrooms you better take your part in this war to come.
I'll give you an idea to win the merchants heart. Tell him to charge 5% on the sell price. If btc goes down 2% he sells so making 3% profit of his selling price. Btc is crazy and it could moon bla bla bla. Then tell him that young people will be attracted by his bussines. 
Let him breathe and just make like hey I just give you one good idea for you bussines, think about it. Then if you spot some empathy on him you can develop your anti banks anti stablishment reasons which I hope he will love.

I'm having some problems understand how seeds work for deriving these different types of addresses. Basically my question is: Can I have one seed that generates both legacy (1xxxxx) and bech32 (bc1xxxxx) (and 3xxx for that matter) addresses?

Bitcoin week,"It would be amazing  to have an annual global Bitcoin week, as Bitcoin is far more deserving than 1 day of the year. 
While the Bitcoin  community are doing excellent work spreading the word throughout the globe, increasing awareness and encouraging adoption, I propose the first week of July (1st - 7th) every year to be the week we really spearhead our efforts into a global collaborative. 
Whatever it is that you do to help adoption, for this week, you must dedicate yourself 100% to the cause. 
It's summertime, maybe host a Bitcoin BBQ, garden party, or any other sort of party. As July 4th falls in this week, for our American bitcoiners, maybe include Bitcoin in your independence day celebrations, as now you know what true independence is. 
Maybe shine a Bitcoin beacon light on your central bank, put up a Bitcoin billboard, or throw on your finest Bitcoin t shirt. Maybe set a goal to introduce 10 people to Bitcoin. Whatever it is you choose to do, make sure its fun, enjoyable, inclusive and not illegal. 
A few months ago I shared how I always offer my customers their change in my taxi in Dublin, I'm still doing it and have introduced many more to Bitcoin since then. For the inaugural Bitcoin week this year,  I'll have my car wrapped in Bitcoin decals, throw a party, and give Bitcoin to charity.
Feel free to share all your ideas below, and lets make this work.

June Bitcoin Adoption Campaign.,"Looking to brainstorm here with you guys on the best ways to increase merchant adoption.

I'm thinking we could work together as a group targeting online merchants.  We could form a group and split up the contact work as well as aid the merchants in setting up btcpay or other solutions.

Frankly, buying online with bitcoin is FASTER than credit card, CHEAPER than credit card (especially with LN) (merch fees 3%) and from a merchants point of view has no Charge Back risks among other advantages we can get into.

Any mechant taking payment in btc COULD also sell BTC or btc based loyalty points, btc basedgift certificates etc. They could even give change back (in btc) from cash purchases to give customers a way to start getting btc! (no kyc needed either as amounts are too small). Plus the more merchants we have the better coverage this network has.

Bottom line bitcoiners are growing in number and as we grow we represent purchasing power. Time to let merchants know how they can serve us better.

Should we form a group to actively approach merchants?

Bitcoin just can't replace official currencies..,"Look, I am a core maximalist hodling my coins since exactly a year ago, my faith in BTC has never been stronger. But whenever someone says Bitcoin will become the world's reserve currency just baffles me, for the simple reason that gold standard had been tried and failed, hence a digital form of gold standard would not be viable either. 

That being said I think BTC can become the world's premier storage of value, surpassing gold's market cap as it absorbs money from the stock market, real estate, bond market and others, which still implies unimaginable numbers from now, albeit not as soon as 2020. \(I'm thinking about over a million per coin by/after 2028 halving\)

The truth about BItcoin,"You are buying a ticket on the roller coaster. If you want to get off, fine. After enough people get off the ride continues. If 95% of ppl get off, it will still continue because those 5 % have payed and will still ride. Same goes for mining. Difficulty drops and more people get back on. BTC is the first and best proven method of an emergent technology and can’t be killed or go away no matter the opinion on reddit or anywhere else for that matter. I’m from Canada and am in Berlin having this debate with some guys from Russia. They are also trying to convince their friends how incredible this NEW tech is. The point is people are aware of it all over the globe, and yes institutional money is already in it and heavily manipulating the price and will continue to as long as it makes them money.  But consider this: BTC is literally as indestructible as the internet. It could be argued it’s as indestructible as DNA. You can bash it, suppress it, manipulate it, compete with it, copy it, call it rat poison, send 1000000 to a burn address (please do, make it even MORE valuable), chew it up and spit it out, but you cannot destroy it. There will always be a global hardcore group of users that will use it even if it goes back to $100. I kind of hope it does so all the weak whiny non-contributing “traders” and non-hodlers can exit the market and then guess what? Bitcoin will do the same thing any useful, valuable and scarce resource will do. Go up. And if you’re smart you get as much of that shit as you can afford and if it goes to $100 you make sure you put your private keys in your will and hand that shit down to your descendants because BITCOIN IS HERE ...TO ....STAY.

Can you use a parent’s ID?,"So I’m under 18 and have done a lot of research so now I wanna invest in a low amount of bitcoin. Just as a start.

Well I tested on my own and realize that you have to use an ID on Coinbase and so many other sites. I need to hear work arounds to how you can get bitcoin, I know those. All I’m asking is do you think I could make an account with my name but use a parent’s passport. Don’t worry I have permission. And then my credit card.

Teach newbies to trade Bitcoin and get paid for it. Need feedback.,"Hey there,

Someone I know are building huge platform to help user to learn more about trading and bitcoin all together.

It's basically social trading platform where you can play a trader without risking your capital and attach explanation to each trade to let your followers know why you made particular trade action and what is your expectations out of it. 

If you guys are familiar with how Patreon works this idea is combination of crypto currency exchange and Patreon.

Not sure how about you, but my first encounter with Bitcoin was on exchange and back then I knew very little about how bitcoin works, so my main motivation to learn more about bitcoin itself was trading. It didn't take long to realise that trading is not for me, but all the knowledge I have by now made me Bitcoin supporter for life.

Someone made a comment elsewhere that traders are the ones that hurt bitcoin price and more traders would make it worse. I disagree with such statement, as more educated traders would ultimately reduce the volatility of the market. The goal here is spread the word about Bitcoin.

Let me know if you would join such platform either as a trader or newbie.",1526738592,19/05/2018 14:03:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8klfx8/teach_newbies_to_trade_bitcoin_and_get_paid_for/,1

I come on the net everyday to see if there are others out there like me but I see no one really talking about this.

Is it really time to boycott or outright mass abandon localbitcoins ??,"It seems local bitcoins now 'NEEDS' your personal gov ID data to supposedly protect YOU from identity theft. This is utter nonsense. None of us do business with localbitcoins, no fiat funds are ever sent to any localbitcoins bank account.

As happy as I am to be verified by the localbitcoin user community, I find it preposterous that the website itself demands that they now NEED my data to 'protect me' from identity theft.

Ludicrous doublespeak. 

Call me old fashioned, but my understanding is that the best way to protect yourself from identity theft is to NOT upload your personal data to some random web site where they will disseminate all of your data INCLUDING trading activity with ANYONE who asks for it through the NSA's pawn goooogle.

Did I get that one wrong?

Does anyone know the names, home addresses, financial records and metadata of the people involved at Localbitcoins? Who are these random people hiding behind a website/corporation that are placing these bizarre fraudulent claims against us??

Anyone in their right minds will cease using this service immediately. Do you really want ANYONE who is willing to pay for your data to know that somewhere in your home you may possibly have the private keys to your personal bitcoin stash, with your actual address provided to them?

This is unbelievably alarming.

Under what authority do these web site operators place this claim on us, their users.

Are we in fact localbitcoins 'customers'?

 If you have never directly purchased anything from localbitcoins you are NOT their 'customer', so claiming KYC/AML is straight up fraudulent.

Does anyone understand why they NEED this?

When will this ludicrous, constant invasion of our privacy, under the guise of 'for your security, for your convenience, to stop crime etc' ever even be noticed by us? The thinking feeling real people who have heart beats., when will we notice, when is enough enough.

Boycott, withdraw all support. Flame them into obscurity. Troll them to oblivion. Do whatever it takes. Point Your bots At them, DDOS them, They have crossed the line, they are sellouts.

Doesn't Greshams law/reverse of Greshams law contradict the network effect?,"I've seen both used as arguments in favor of bitcoin. 

However if theirs' law (the Reverse of Greshams law, which applies when currencies aren't legal tender, such as bitcoin vs other cryptocurrencies) is true, then the network effect doesn't matter, what then matters most is which currency is going to appreciate the most in value/hold value the best or have the most utility later on. If this is the case, then a cryptocurrency with higher utility but less adoption would/could out compete bitcoin. 

If the network effect is what matters most, then Greshams/theirs law doesn't matter, as you could have a currency that has a larger network (USD) but doesn't have as high of utility/store of value. 


So it seems like they contradict. How do we make them work together? Or is one only true? Either cryptocurrency can't out compete larger monetary networks or it doesn't matter if bitcoin is ahead of the rest  and has higher adoption IF another cryptocurrency has higher utility and has a better store of value then it does.

Would love to hear some thoughts on this issue. ",1526778547,20/05/2018 01:09:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kpiib/doesnt_greshams_lawreverse_of_greshams_law/,1

Any thoughts on currency agnosticism?,"Personal disclosure, I'm not a bitcoin maximalist. I like it. But I think there's a demand for several types of currencies with different properties. Just like there's a demand for different types of governments.

I know a hot topic in alts is cross chain compatibility. Ultimately the idea is to send the currency you hold and the counter party receives the currency they want. So it doesn't matter if somebody is sending you a shitty currency. You're getting the value you want in your currency of choice.

I'm not going to name names, since I don't want to come across as an alt shill on this sub. But originally they all planned on being compatible with BTC. Unfortunately I don't hear much of a peep from bitcoin's end about those projects. So I take it they're being avoided.

But maybe I'm just out of the loop. Are there any currency agnostic platforms bitcoin's working on?",1526785555,20/05/2018 03:05:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kq45k/any_thoughts_on_currency_agnosticism/,1

"Considering cloud mining, advice appreciated","I am looking into cloud mining but I am not sure it will be worth my while, could anyone with a bit more knowledge on this please confirm if the following is correct or I am not taking certain factors into account: 

My understanding is that there is an initial investment, let’s say I put in 0,15 btc, approx 1200$, my understanding is that the returns are calculated in usd and converted and paid in btc at the time of payment. So on 1200$, the calculator estimates returns of somewhere between 2,500$ and 3,400$, minus maintenance charges, at the moment that’s a return of 0.31 to 0.4 btc, however if btc price doubles, surely the returns, as they are calculated in $, would be between 0,15 to 0,2 btc, on top of that as btc mining difficulty increases, there can be more maintenance charges, so as I believe btc price will double soon (do not want to discuss that in this thread) and being conservative and would expect the lower estimate for returns, would I be investing 0,15 btc to get back 0,15 btc minus maintenance costs? 
Do I have that right if I am correct in guessing btc price will double? Also if mining will get harder could there be a possibility of actually earning less btc than it costs me? I suppose if I wanted to convert all btc to fiat once received it would be profitable but I have a good fiat income already and I am only interested in earning more btc, when I look at this I feel I would be better off just buying btc and HODL

Please let me know your thoughts, are there any factors I am not taking into account? Thanks in advance for any comments",1526799543,20/05/2018 06:59:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kr48k/considering_cloud_mining_advice_appreciated/,1

Bitcoin Week,"It would be amazing to have an annual global Bitcoin week, as Bitcoin is far more deserving than 1 day of the year. While the Bitcoin community are doing excellent work spreading the word throughout the globe, increasing awareness and encouraging adoption, I propose the first week of July (1st - 7th) every year to be the week we really spearhead our efforts into a global collaborative. Whatever it is that you do to help adoption, for this week, you must dedicate yourself 100% to the cause. It's summertime, maybe host a Bitcoin BBQ, garden party, or any other sort of party. As July 4th falls in this week, for our American bitcoiners, maybe include Bitcoin in your independence day celebrations, as now you know what true independence is. Maybe shine a Bitcoin beacon light on your central bank, put up a Bitcoin billboard, or throw on your finest Bitcoin t shirt. Maybe set a goal to introduce 10 people to Bitcoin. Whatever it is you choose to do, make sure its fun, enjoyable, inclusive and not illegal. A few months ago I shared how I always offer my customers their change in Bitcoin in my taxi in Dublin, I'm still doing it and have introduced many more to Bitcoin since then. For the inaugural Bitcoin week this year, I'll have my car wrapped in Bitcoin decals, throw a party, and give Bitcoin to charity.

Just a reminder that Genesis Mining is a total scam. Nobody should 'invest' with them.,"There isn't a single 'investor' who has ever received a break-even ROI. This is a fact. Everybody who has ever given them money has ended up with less than they gave.

If the price shoots up, sure it feels like you're making gains. But the reality is that if you gave any crypto to Genesis, you will only ever get a fraction of your original crypto back. Not even 100% of the initial investment, let alone profit. 

It is a clear ponzi. This company's operational costs are obviously in fiat. They rent IT spaces in various countries, buy servers and graphics cards and netwoking equipment, pay salaries, advertising, travel, etc. 

So they're taking all your money in bitcoin and then what? Converting it to Fiat so that they can mine bitcoin again?

(2) When the program returns ''no route to host'' is this because the program can't find a route where the channel capacities allow for the 'shunting of coins' to take place?

Selfish mining simulator (with monetary and time variables),"I am a bit late to the Selfish Mining debate but like many I got interested after Craig Wright started challenging the “Ittay Eyal, Emin Gun Sirer -  Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable” paper.  So I also created a simulation to try and understand and simulate the conclusions reached in this paper.  I could not find that mininers can in any way be incentivised to follow or join a selfish strategy as it simply is not more profitable than honest mining.  

What baffles me most I suppose is that neither the paper nor most of the discussions take any consideration for cost of mining operations and including a time variable.  The paper concludes that selfish  miners “earn revenues in excess of their mining power”.  Do I understand correct that revenue refers to income before cost of producing that income?  If so how is revenue even relevant without considering expenses when discussing incentives?

Note I do not say the paper is wrong - at least not yet.  I am simply asking for clarification in pointing out my possible error.  As a hypothetical miner seeking to increase my profits by any means, how can I change the simulation to show that it can be more profitable to selfish mine so that I can apply it to a real mining operation?
  
&amp;nbsp;

Simulation: https://repl.it/repls/HealthyUnwillingBetatest  
Source: https://github.com/pvrooyen/sm
  
I cross referenced my results with u/theGreyWyvern ‘s simulation here:  
http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/selfishmining,  as well as getting some algorithmic ideas from the source.
  
&amp;nbsp;

Here is a sample output at first retarget and the end of day 100:
  
  
---

`day 1 - 18 excluded...  `  
`Day 19:  `  
Public chain is at 1969 blocks, SM caused 663 orphans  
SM rewarded for 890 blocks, (921 if honest)  
Earnings $898.9 ($930.21 if honest)  
Expenses $957.6  
Profit $-58.7 ($-27.19 if honest)  

Difficulty adjustment after 2016 blocks taking 19.45 days  
Time (in mins) expected:	20160  
Time (in mins) actual  :	28012  
Difficulty adjusting to:	0.72 
SM mining strategy now  : 	HONEST  

`day 20 - 99 excluded...`  

`Day 100:  `  
Public chain is at 13427 blocks, SM caused 2435 orphans  
SM rewarded for 5238 blocks, (5552 if honest)  
Earnings $5290.38 ($5607.52 if honest)  
Expenses $5040  
Profit $250.38 ($567.22 if honest)    

`SUMMARY:  `  
SM network share: 35%  
HM mining on SM blocks: 50%  
SM start of by mining selfishly  
SM switches strategy on each retarget: yes  
After 100 days of mining, SM profited $250.38 where it would have profited $567.22 if mining normally.  
SM changed its total network share from 35% to 39% by following this strategy  
SM forfeited 55.86% of its normal income stream by following this strategy  

---
  
&amp;nbsp;

For simplicity sake a few assumptions must be made.  In specific assuming that a Markov chain model is accurate enough for the simulation. 

&amp;nbsp;  


Thanks in advance for any constructive criticism and suggestions on how the simulation can be updated to either show the attack to be profitable or show that the paper might be in error

CoinGate is launching Bitcoin Lightning Network payment processing for merchants,"CoinGate is a payment gateway for cryptocurrencies, and we have always been staunch supporters of Bitcoin. Since 2014, when we started developing our platform, we were driven by the unique community spirit surrounding Bitcoin, and, equally importantly, by Bitcoin’s technological potential. As such, we decided to operate accordingly: aiming to contribute to the network to the best of our ability whilst reaping the benefits that Bitcoin presented to us. And so, since 2015, all of our transactions have been batched to minimize the strain we put on the network, and in December of last year we became one of the first payment processors to integrate SegWit.

Today, we have an exciting announcement to make, regarding a further improvement of our platform and adoption of a Bitcoin scaling solution.

Lightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network.

Implementing Lightning payments has been our aspiration for a long time and we are excited to finally launch it in our Sandbox environment. An intense testing phase is ongoing and we welcome everyone to give Lightning Network a try by \[purchasing a virtual cup of coffee on our test shop\]\(https://example.coingate.com\).

In the meantime, we are preparing to run pilot integrations in live environment with a select group of merchants that wish to join us in becoming early adopters of this exciting tech. If you are interested in accepting Bitcoin payments via Lightning Network with CoinGate, \[please fill out this form\]\(https://goo.gl/forms/PjTCvcUVHi0rnIJZ2\).

A word of warning though \- the Lightning Network is in its early stages:

* it is not yet user\-friendly, and really more suited to advanced \(technical\) users, though we are sure this will change soon with growing adoption;
* there will be bugs, both in the Lightning Network itself, and in our implementation of it; this is expected, and the reason we are publishing this post is precisely to get community feedback and squash those bugs before releasing the Lightning Network in the live environment.

Any feedback is very welcome and encouraged; please write to us at [lightning@coingate.com](mailto:lightning@coingate.com) regarding anything related to LN.

To those unfamiliar with CoinGate, we are based in Vilnius, Lithuania, and have been building and operating our platform since mid\-2014. We started off slowly, but grew very quickly in 2017 and, at the present time, we serve over 4,000 merchants using our gateway to accept 50\+ cryptocurrencies. We are quite popular among technical businesses \(VPN, hosting and similar\) and niche industries, but our focus and ultimate goal is to bring cryptocurrency payments mainstream and to make them one of the default payment methods in everyday shopping. We have always strived to be a community\-oriented payment processor, and we are proud to still charge zero transaction fees to shoppers, and to source our exchange rates without hidden markups.

What if 2nd layer solutions were tied to more than just BTC? Could BTC take over the fin world?,"I just had a thought,    I was thinking that bc BTC is the most secure dist ledger with incentives for miners...   what if a private key with only miners fee worth of BTC, was also tied to an asset, 

Example,  100 shares of x is tied (through second layer) to an address with only 50 sats (or enough for miners fee to transfer)

that private key would own the asset, and could be transferred.  
Meaning that BTC could be the settlement layer for trillions of other assets besides BTC.  And would be used bc it is the most secure blockchain.  that would (of course increase price) but not be subject to the volatility of price, (only fees)

Just a thought I had, which would add enourmous value to the one and only censorship resistant blockchain around,...  BTC.   ",1526849375,20/05/2018 20:49:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kvfx7/what_if_2nd_layer_solutions_were_tied_to_more/,1

Current Bitcoin Carbon Emissions. The numbers. Can we discuss please?,"I received a PM from a redditor about a [old comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6jlfes/cryptocurrency_mining_is_making_some_graphics/djff69k/). His PM reads -
&gt;So back 10 months ago I posted this comment and you responded with the most reasoned response about the entire Bitcoin network emitting less carbon than a single 747. It made me feel much better about Bitcoin. It also confused me this past few weeks with people posting stories stating that Bitcoin will soon use nearly 0.1% of the world's energy and already consumes more power than every single solar panel in the entire world produces. Those two don't really square, so I looked back and the article you reference was from 2014. I'm curious if you've reevaluated your stance on bitcoin or perhaps have some insight that the current hysteria is just overblown?

Since I've spent the time doing some napkin math (I could be horribly wrong on this, someone *please* correct me!), I thought I should make this post public for everone to evaulate my maths and my reasoning.

First, I would just redirect to AA's great clip on the subject -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fExR-IKozOY

As for re-evaluating my position, yes, constantly. Im going to do this really quickly, so unsure of accuracy, but should give a rough ball park.

http://www.yousustain.com/footprint/howmuchco2?co2=761+tons

Says its about 761 tons for a 747 to fly 24 hrs.

https://www.thebalance.com/how-much-power-does-the-bitcoin-network-use-391280

Claims 1 watt per 1 second gigahash. Comes out to 343 mW per second. Thats 1234800 mW per hour, which equals 29635200 mWh for 24 hrs. The formula used to calculate megawatt-hours is Megawatt hours (MWh) = Megawatts (MW) x Hours (h). In this case, I've used 24 hours since we are comparing to 24 hours of a 747 flying, so 24 MWh. So currently btc mining has a rate of 1,234,800 per MWh.

Putting 29635200000 (previous mWh * 1000 for kWh) into [this government calculator](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator) will give you caron comparisons. That calculator claims an equivilent of 2,481,717,074 gallons of gas consumed. Yes, thats nearly 2.5 billion.

To make this comparison more comprehensible....

https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&amp;t=10

&gt;In 2017, about 143.85 billion gallons (or about 3.40 billion barrels1) of finished motor gasoline were consumed2 in the United States, a daily average of about 391.40 million gallons (or about 9.32 million barrels per day). 

This would be equivilent of 6.33 days of gasoline usage in the USA for a single day of mining.


So go go back to our airplane analogy, the carbon calculator says that many mW = 22,055,020 metric tons of carbon emitted.

I do recall looking into the airplane thing back when we were discussing it, and I remember looking at the numbers. Frankly, its impossible to believe those were accurate and im sorry. I should have double checked everything.

According to - https://charts.bitcoin.com/chart/hash-rate

We had around ""5EHash"" in august of 2017, when that comment was made. We are now at 31EHash, over a 6x fold since that comment was made.

Now that we have the numbers out of the way, some things to consider...

These estimates are based upon the USA's carbon calculators which measures average carbon output based on the varying technologies in the US. [According to the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States) the US only is around 12% (in 2016) for renewable energy.

So in general, our energy is pretty damn dirty and we put out a **lot** more carbon than we sequester.

In that AA video, he talks about the geolocation arbitrage used by miners. This makes a lot of sense. If you are going to invest 50-500 million into a mining operation, are you going to do it in a area where it costs 12 cents per hour (US average), or where it costs 3-4 cents per kwH? See -

https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/01/13/renewable-energy-cost-effective-fossil-fuels-2020/#1c69d08e4ff2

Obviously you are going to massively reduce your operational cost as that is what will lead your investment to become profitable.

Fortunately for us, and the world, many of these arbitrage opportunities are in hydroelectric and geothermal energy areas. These plants are designed to be future proofed, so enterprising mining congolmerates will move to areas where they can secure very cheap energy prices. When these companies are currently using 5-15 GwH for their cities, with 50 GwH capacity, they will happily sell their extra capacity to the mining operation since that is a very favorable economic incentive to all parties.

Another factor to consider is that for every single new ASIC design, they are becoming more energy efficient. So even though the hashrate is jumping, I would say the overall energy used by the network will plateau, if it has not already done so. With GMO and other giants like Samsung entering the mining design fray, this will only speed up energy efficiency.

None of this is intended to be a sidestepping of the facts - Clearly the bitcoin network uses a **lot** of energy. And when you have less regulated countries (china, India), it presents opportunities for locals to setup mining operations inside their locality, which then uses dirty energy, increasing carbon outputs.

The amount of carbon emissions per day (22,055,020 metric tons) that is above is obviously not very accurate when you account for these arbitrage opportunties. We know for a fact many of the largest mining colo's are situated near hydroelectric and Geothermal energy plants, which means that they are practically *zero* carbon emissions. Since we do not know the location of every miner, due to the decentralized unregulated nature of bitcoin, it is impossible to calculate how much of a reduction of tons of carbon we will get for that calculation.

But even if we are generous, and say 50% of all mining is done on renewables, that still leaves 11 million tons of carbon per day, a pretty staggering amount.

There is also [much to hope for with scientists claiming we can be 100% renewable energy across the entire planet](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/05/18/study-100-global-energy-system-feasible/). Such as scientists setting to prove through empiracle data that it is feasible to convert the entire planet to 100% renewables. Though it is probably not realistic that this will happen quickly, or even at all. To give perspective, CFC's have been banned for decades and thought not in use for over a decade, [yet recent data has shown levels are increasing](https://interestingengineering.com/banned-ozone-destroying-gas-back-on-the-rise-warn-scientists). There will always be industry willing to destroy the world in the future for short term profit now.

We should also weigh the costs and benefits of this massive network. If bitcoin becomes adopted across the world as a currency, which if you look at places like Japan, it clearly is, then this will enable *literal billions* of people who are currently unbanked to join into the global financial ecosystem.

The personal financial soverignty that bitcoin brings is of *incalcuable value*. Whether the carbon emissions are worth these trade offs is a philosophical question that probably does not have an right or wrong answer.

Then we must also evaluate the carbon impact that the bitcoin network would have if cryptocurrencies were to *replace* traditional financial networks. There are some good analysis on the carbon footprint of banks, and bitcoin mining, coindesk has done several articles, see -

https://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/

&amp;

https://www.coindesk.com/microscope-true-costs-banking/

If we are properly to examine the impact that cryptocurrency carbon emissions have on society, then we should also examine the *reduction* of carbon that cryptocurrency networks will have upon the banking sector.

[This site](https://www.comfort-pro.com/2015/10/how-much-energy-does-an-air-conditioner-ac-use-infographic/) Claims AC &amp; Heating results in 47.7 % of the entire USA's electricity usage. This example is just to present a understanding of how much energy these systems use.

How many Banks are there around the world that have their AC on 24/7? I can imagine just that number alone would lead to a staggering level of CO2 emissions. The coindesk article claims 591k bank branches around the world. The above aritcle claims 3.5k watts for a single central air unit. I had a family member that used to run a A/C business and I've been on top of many businesses. A bank will likely have several of those units to keep the place cool, I would estimate between 2-10 depending upon size.

In more good news, [Bank branches are declining](https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-double-down-on-branch-cutbacks-1517826601), and cryptocurrencies will only accelerate this. Lets hope that bitcoin is the amazon of retail brick and mortor closures.

In conclusion, there is a valid and rational concern as to the amount of power that the bitcoin network brings. And instead of being dismissive, we should recognize the incredible rate at which the bitcoin network is growing on an annual basis. From 4.3EHash to 31EHash over the last year, that is about a 8x fold increase.

Since we can assume that the majority of hashpower is coming online in the last year is likely newer models, these units should be at the current efficiencies.  The estimates above should be *roughly* accurate based on this information.

This information will only be used by politicians and media congolmerates to spin a very bad negative impression of the bitcoin network. And you know what? *Maybe they are right*. Maybe bitcoin is growing into a massive CO2 producing beast that outweighs the benefits that it brings to society.

But how can we reach a consensus on this issue unless we, the hardcore bitcoiners and techophiles, bring the numbers into sunlight and discuss?

What if you forget your bitcoin wallet password？,"Recently many people who bought bitcoin years ago find themselves sitting on an untouchable bounty. Those lucky guys who purchased or mined just a few bitcoins at the start of the age of cryptocurrency nowadays can boast about their savings. However, some of them are now in a painful limbo，because they can't remember the complex security passwords needed to get to their bitcoin wallet. Unlike a bank, bitcoin has no central hotline to call for a reset. This is really a bad thing，it's like forgetting a bank account password, but there's no bank to call to reset it. That money is lost forever. That might be a lot of money at today’s exchange rate.

Actyally, this bad thing happened to me last year, and my friend recommend  this website：http://recovermybtc.com/ to me，she said she has retrieved her bitcoin wallet password through it，and I download this software，it really works after I used it，and you need to pay some service fee to them, but it's not high.Somebody who lost their bitcoin password can make a try, good luck.",1526868478,21/05/2018 02:07:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kxf5s/what_if_you_forget_your_bitcoin_wallet_password/,1

Their fee calculation needs to be improved.

Winklevosses (or Someone) Needs to Buyer CoinStar and Convert its 20k Machines into Bitcoin Sales Kiosks,"Although BTM machine adoption is growing at a fast pace (300 machines a month), it is going to take some time before that network gets built out.

Presently the hedge fund Apollo Global Management owns Outerwall which is the parent company of CoinStar.  What would make such a deal perfect is that Coinstar already runs a profitable business, so even in locations in which there wasn't much btc activity on the machines it would still be a very profitable overall deal.  

This idea has been proposed before in earlier threads but its a better time for the deal to take place.  The network effect of such a move on the utility of BTC would be gigantic.

Bitcoin Predicted to Surge,"According to CoinShares chairman Danny Masters, Bitcoin will surge this year, but a few things need to happen first: Better structures and a life cycle post initial coin offerings.

Indices and performance measures need to be developed so people can begin to understand how to measure performance. Investors need more clarity, better expectations, and more transparency.

Bitcoin's life cycle is still very early, and building a financial system takes time. 

Any thoughts on this accuracy?

Announcing the 2018 Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study (Cambridge University),"Hello,

The [Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance \(CCAF\)](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/),  an academic research centre at the University of Cambridge Judge  Business School, is conducting the second edition of its Global  Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study.  The  goal of this research study is to present a comprehensive empirical  picture of the global cryptoasset activities and provide novel insights  into the current state and evolution of the ecosystem. The **first edition** of the Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study, published in April 2017 and freely available for download on our [website](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/global-cryptocurrency/), featured non\-public data from over 140 cryptoasset companies and entities.  It has received worldwide media coverage and interest from industry,  policymakers and researchers. It has been mentioned in publications such  as the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/23/the-guardian-view-on-cryptocurrencies-bubble-and-chic), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/apaul/2017/11/27/its-1994-in-cryptocurrency/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/turning-coal-into-bitcoin-dirty-secret-of-2017-s-hottest-market) and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-environment-green-energy-power-global-warming-climate-change-a8094661.html), and was cited in reports of the [World Bank](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/8a338a98-75cd-4771-b94c-5b6db01e2797/IFC-EMCompass-BlockchainReport_WebReady.pdf?MOD=AJPERES) and the [Financial Stability Board](http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R270617.pdf), among others. Today, we are releasing **two surveys** that are directed towards miners and service providers \(e.g. exchanges, wallets, payment service providers\). If you are active in one of these areas, we would be delighted to have you contribute to this study. All survey links can be found on our [website](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/research/live-research-surveys/). The surveys are avalaible in **English, Spanish, and Chinese**. **To avoid phishing attempts, please make sure to you use the survey links from the live research surveys page to take the survey.**Please  note that most questions are optional and do not require a response.  Individual responses will be anonymised, and findings will only be  presented at the aggregate level \(e.g. by activity, region, etc.\). **All identifying information concerning you and/or your organisation’s responses will be removed from the published study**. All survey participants have the option to be prominently acknowledged in the benchmarking report with their logo displayed.The findings of this research study will be presented in Q3 2018 in a report that will be freely available on our [website](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/) like all our previous reports.We  would like to thank you in advance for contributing to this research  study.

Want to be a guest on our podcast?,"Hi everyone,

My name is Felix and just over six months ago I started the ‘Crypto Authority,’ a brand that exists to share cryptocurrency knowledge and incite people to get involved with the field.

We currently run a blog and a Twitter page but since completing my final university research project last week, I’ve been planning on how to grow the brand; which is why I've come to this sub.

We're looking to start a podcast and wanted to see if there was anyone in this sub who'd be interested in coming on and having a discussion about cryptos and blockchain.

I have plenty of ideas and plans so if you’re interested I’d love to explain it in more detail.

Here’s the link to our blog: https://cryptoauthority.co.uk Our Twitter: https://twitter.com/cryptoauthorit Our email: thecryptoauthority@gmail.com

Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 118: SIGHASH_NOINPUT (eltoo precursor soft-fork),"[**BIP 118**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/98b7238f68d17f0e01275dd32075078702225356) is what I would consider as uncontroversial as it gets in regards to softforks. It breaks nothing and adds a feature for Lightning.

eltoo is an improvement to the Lightning protocol that requires the change provided in BIP 118.

More information on eltoo can be found [**here**](https://blockstream.com/2018/04/30/eltoo-next-lightning.html) and [**here.**](https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf)

Previous Reddit conversations can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g17vs/eltoo_a_simplified_update_mechanism_for_lightning/) and [**here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g6os0/lightning_network_is_being_developed_at_the_speed/)

A short summary of eltoo, as ""layman"" as I can be:

&gt;Let's say a ""final"" state (state 4) of a channel is sent to the network by your nodes peer, but you have a *newer* ""final state"" (state 6) and want to contest, to validify your contestation you need to provide the entire history of channel state updates in the transaction.

&gt;This is extra data, which cost extra satoshi, and it requires you or any entity watching your channel to store the entire history of channel states.

&gt;eltoo allows the freedom to only store the latest state and prove that it's the later state without providing the entire state history.",1526907332,21/05/2018 12:55:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l0lhu/bitcoin_improvement_proposal_118_sighash_noinput/,1

Who is Satoshi Nakamoto ? An Investigation !,"Who is Satoshi Nakamoto ? 

All the reporters worldwide say, "" we do not know who is Satoshi Nakamoto?"" 

Bitcoin and Blockchain invention and Satoshi Nakamoto both topics are extraordinarily mysterious. Therefore, it was necessary for an investigative approach to identify and  pinpoint who is Satoshi Nakamoto ? I am Bond, James Bond ! Bitcoin James Bond. I have completed  6 months investigation to uncover the mystery of Bitcoin and Blockchain invention and its illusive inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. I have done my investigation by the order of the Lord Chancellor of the Superior  Financial Authority. I have discovered more fascinating story and reports that is far more mysterious than Bitcoin and Blockchain invention itself. Yes, it is all about Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese pseudonym. The man behind this pseudonym is not a  Japanese man but a British Economic Scientist, who is visible but unseen. Why he is visible but unseen is more mysterious and worthy to be a great story to produce a Hollywood Blockbuster movie. I am not in a hurry to publish his true identity on this Reddit Forum right now but I will do that eventually after some further investigation and research. Here what I have pointed out is, He is not Japanese but a British Economic Scientist. It is 100&amp;#37; percent confirmed.

Digital Gold or Digital Cash? Your Age May Affect Your Opinion.,"Ever since I read the Book of Satoshi \([https://www.bookofsatoshi.com/](https://www.bookofsatoshi.com/)\) I have been fascinated by the debate about whether Bitcoin is/should be primarily a 'store of wealth' or 'digital cash'. A few days ago I ended up in yet another debate about block size and scaling and I took a brief survey of the various folks who weighed in, specifically noting their ages.

The loudest advocates of Bitcoin as 'digital cash' don't seem to have any concern for money they aren't going to spend really, really soon. They plan to spend it in small amounts and they care a lot about fees. They generally seem to be relatively young and don't have investments in gold, bonds or equities. As a generalization, it seems like perhaps they don't have any wealth to store.

On the other hand, it seems to me that older people care a lot more about Bitcoin's use as a type of digital Gold. I suspect that this is because they are much more concerned about protecting their wealth from banks, governments and inflation than they are about spending it. This assumes that older people who know about Bitcoin generally have higher net worth than younger people who know about Bitcoin \(this is my baseline assumption\).

It would be interesting to see an actual survey where we can get people to reveal their age \(or better: net worth\) and their vote: SV \(Store of Value\) or DC \(Digital Cash\).",1526910368,21/05/2018 13:46:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l0x6v/digital_gold_or_digital_cash_your_age_may_affect/,1

Hardware wallet vs. Bitcoin Node coin storage questions,"So I recently bought a computer with the specific intent of running a node to help the network. A few weeks go I set it up, downloaded the blockchain and am currently running a full node! However I still am new to running a node and after messing with the core client for a bit, I have some specific questions I haven't been able to find from reading or youtube videos. 

Would it be more secure to hold my bitcoins on the node wallet or on a hardware wallet? Currently I have my coins on a hardware wallet, but its my understanding that you still have to trust the hardware device company to tap into the bitcoin network and tell you how much you have. When if you have a node, you don't have to trust a third party to tell you your funds are there because the proof is in the blockchain on your node. Am I correct in this? Would that mean it would be better to store my coins on my node computer?

Its also my understanding that if you lose your hardware device, as long as you have the passphrase when you setup the wallet, you can order a new device, reinsert your phrase and get access to your funds. Does a node work the same way? What would happen if someone stole my node computer, but they could not get access to my funds because of my encrypted passphase? How would I recover my funds? If I got a new mode computer after mine had theoretically been stolen, can I  get access to my funds similar in process to a hardware wallet? How would this work? 

I'm just looking for some clarification as to if a node is safer to store my funds that a hardware wallet and what would the process be to recover funds if my node computer was stolen. Any info on this process would be helpful, thanks!",1526913517,21/05/2018 14:38:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l1af3/hardware_wallet_vs_bitcoin_node_coin_storage/,1

What Is Bitcoin? A Remarkably Easy to Understand Introduction to Cryptocurrency,"[""What Is Bitcoin? A Remarkably Easy to Understand Introduction to Cryptocurrency""](https://rosecrypto.com/What-Is-Bitcoin)

Imagine if you had a resource that you could give to anyone - your uncle, your aunt, your mom, your coworker, whoever - that explains the basics of Bitcoin in a way that almost anyone can understand -- easily and near-instantly!

You don't need to imagine: it's here.

Hello everyone. I wrote this article with the express intention of creating an introduction to Bitcoin which is extremely straightforward. It's purposefully not *technical* at all - like it or not, an enormous part of the world is not interested in the technical aspects of Bitcoin. Many of these people are intelligent, as well - you can be a genius and still not have a lot of patience for technical details.

With that said, my belief is that being uninterested in technical details *should not* bar you from learning about Bitcoin and how it is going to change the world.

If you want to tell your friends about Bitcoin, this is how you do it -- even if they aren't technically minded. Take a look now and let me know what you think - hopefully this helps some people out!

“เราต้องทำการประกาศ List ออกมา ถ้าประกาศออกมาก่อนก็จะมีน้อยตัว ตอนนี้ก็คงมีแต่ Bitcoin และ Ether ใครคิดว่ามันควรมีอะไรอีก ก็บอกกับทางเรา ให้พิจารณา และประกาศใน Set แรกเลย ถ้าสมมุติว่าประกาศไปแล้วยังขาดตกอะไร ก็ประกาศเพิ่มได้ ใครอยากจะเพิ่มอะไร Ripple อะไรก็แล้วแต่”",1526923379,21/05/2018 17:22:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l2kbq/thai_translation_question_about_new_crypto/,1

LibertyX Reaches 2k Merchants Selling BTC Through Regular Stores,"I've been doing a lot of research recently on Bitcoin ATM growth and other networks that sell bitcoin to try to pin down how much much money is going into crypto.  In doing that research I stumbled upon an interesting company called LibertyX. website: https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations

How it works is that merchants sign up as a location where customers can buy Bitcoin.  When a customer goes to a store to buy coin they pay the merchant a fee above the spot price that is usually around 6-7%.  LibertyX fronts the merchant the btc and then the store sends the funds from the customers back to LibertyX to complete the loop.  LibertyX likely keeps a portion of the mark-up in exchange for providing customers to the stores from its website and for providing the merchants with liquidity.  

Fees are slightly lower than bitcoin atms.  The service is offered in the United States and Australia.  For merchants they fill out a form that doesn't seem too complex and then they are set-up.  

From their webpage:

How LibertyX Works
1. Find Store

Find a LibertyX partner store near you by using the store locator.

2. Pay Cash

Follow the instructions on the store's page and pay cashier.

3. Receive Bitcoin

Bitcoin is immediately sent to your wallet as soon as payment is made (and before you leave the store)!",1526927766,21/05/2018 18:36:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l3554/libertyx_reaches_2k_merchants_selling_btc_through/,1

The Simpsons mine bitcoins,"Today «bitcoin» and «blockchain» have. become household words, everybody’s familiar with. Crypto-terms are seem to be used almost in every sphere of life. Indeed, according to Forclog portal, the recent step of Bitcoin towards mass adoption is featuring the popular freemium game, The Simpsons: Tapped Out.



The game begins as per usual: Homer is not taking his nuclear power plant job seriously, playing mobile games instead of working. Martin is talking about blockchain all the time, mentioning it numerous times, without explaining exactly what it is. Admitting that he had never heard of blockchain “until last week”, he says: “I mined some bitcoin with my computer, and then the value went through the roof” and adds: “Now I act like I’m an expert on it!”



Once players completed this task, they are also be asked to encourage three youngsters to mine bitcoin on their computers.

A movement to merge BTC and BCH.,"In this [article](https://medium.com/@ercwl/chainmerger-unifying-blockchains-after-a-fork-4ccc930907c0), Eric Wall discusses some of the theoretical challenges that would have to be overcome if the BTC and BCH blockchains were to be merged. 

I'll start by saying that I'm a relative newcomer to the cryptosphere; I bought my first bitcoins less than 1 year ago, but since then I have become enamored with the technology and do believe that it is the future. The Bitcoin Cash hardfork was over my head when it occured and only in the last several months have I dug into the scaling debate. I have also spent innumerable hours reading the history of bitcoin and some of the pioneers who made it possible--here on Reddit, in books, Medium, and other darker corners of the Internet. 

I'm not ideologically attached to either BTC or BCH--I'm a believer in bitcoin. To BTC I could say, ""You began to prioritize transaction fees over block rewards and that's a problem."" To BCH I could say, ""You can't increase block sizes to infinity--even despite Moore's law."" I want to see bitcoin succeed as both the universal settlement layer for large financial transactions *and* as a currency that brings financial freedom for the unbanked. 

There are two potential futures for the two forks of bitcoin: 1) the market will decide that either BTC or BCH is no longer needed and its price will drop to zero, the miners will stop mining transactions, and node operators will move on. 2) both chains will survive pandering to two different (but still very important) use cases. In my opinion, both outcomes are undesirable. 

If it's scenario 1, then a good number of people who came to bitcoin looking to invest in the future and to keep their value safe from totalitarian regimes will be left with nothing. Also, in the time it takes for one of the chains do die, all of that chain's hashing power, electricity, development of hardware and software could have been supporting the eventually surviving chain. In short, if one of the chains dies there is no shortage of waste. Speaking pragmatically, this is not a good thing.

If it's scenario 2, then we have two robust ecosystems of miners, developers, node operators, etc. managing each chain. This would be all well in good if someone could demonstrate that our two different use cases (universal settlement layer for large financial transactions and instant, free money transfers for use in every-day transactions) actually mandate two different blockchain ecosystems. It seems to me that this would just be equally wasteful. Again, pragmatically speaking, the wasted talent, hashing power, etc. is regrettable.

I don't like either scenario. I would rather see the best blockchain thought leaders, developers, entrepreneurs, and web personalities admit two facts: 1) there were real and legitimate reasons for the BCH hardfork and 2) a hardfork was a really wasteful way of achieving what were in fact noble ends. We've created a rupture through a lack of dialogue and now what is needed, long before any development would ever begin, is a movement that seeks to reconcile the differences between the BTC and BCH communities. Then, and only then, could we begin the very difficult task of a chain merge--that will be a feat that will require as much cooperation and evangelization as brilliant development. I hope that one day it could be possible and I will, starting today, begin preaching the message of a chain merge to anyone who will listen.

Question: Is there a BIP that proposes this: A protocol built-in plausible deniable $5 wrench theft protection.,"Here is the idea (vision):

On my address 1AbCdEfGhjKLmNpQrStUvW (or probably another address, not starting with ""1"", but anyway...), I have 1 bitcoin (or whatever). It is time locked until 17 Apr 2022, as everybody can readily see from the blockchain.

Some thief tries to steal my Bitcoin ($5 wrench attack). I say ""I cannot send you the bitcoin, even if I wanted to! It is cryptographically time locked till 17 Apr 2022"". The thief looks at the blockchain and sees that I am right. So he says ""ok, then you give me the private key"". So I give him the private key.

Now, fortunately, one day later or so, after the thief has left, I can unlock the bitcoin sitting in ""1AbCdEfGhjKLmNpQrStUvW"" already TODAY (year 2018), because(!) the transaction that sent the 1 bitcoin to ""1AbCdEfGhjKLmNpQrStUvW"" was a script specifying TWO conditions, only ONE of which needs to be fulfilled to spend the coin! Condition 1 is the default condition which is:

* *I must have the secret key of ""1AbCdEfGhjKLmNpQrStUvW"" AND the date must be 17 Apr 2022 or later*

Condition 2 is:

* *I must own the secret key of ""qwertyuiopasdfghj""! Here, no time lock applies*.

The thing is, that acc. to this yet-to-be-defined BIP, this second condition is always present in this kind of ""BIP y.t.b.d."" transaction, also if it is not actively used! This is why it is plausible deniable! If the $5 wrench attacker asks me to give him the secret key of ""qwertyuiopasdfghj"", I can plausibly say ""this does not exist. There only exists a secret key for ""1AbCdEfGhjKLmNpQrStUvW"". The point is that the person who sent me (i.e. to ""1AbCdEfGhjKLmNpQrStUvW"") the 1 bitcoin specified the lock time, but that person not necessarily specified the ""early realease"" hash of the private key (here ""qwertyuiopasdfghj""), as this is just OPTIONAL by the protocol. If the sender does not specify that second ""early release"" hash, a random hash will be generated by the protocol as disguise, a hash for which no secret key exists at all.

So the attacker (or blockchain analyst) has no way to tell if that second condition (the ""qwertyuiopasdfghj"" hash) was set on purpose by the sender of that 1 bitcoin, or if it was set automatically as the standard default way.

So with this feature (BIP), we'd have a plausible deniable theft protection mechanism against the $5 wrench attack.

----------

Another way of putting it: We need a multisig ""1 of 2"" script, for which ONE of the 2 is time-locked, the other is not.

Or is this possible already with today's protocol? If yes, we have the feature already, and I'd like to request to develop wallets that make use of this as GUI feature ""send to yourself with time lock and plausible deniability of early spending"".",1526940165,21/05/2018 22:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l4p49/question_is_there_a_bip_that_proposes_this_a/,1

"Will Bitcoin or Blockchain be able to help resolve the school gun shooting phenomenon in the US, as the technology helps to link and cross check registered firearms when they change hands in the market?","Will Bitcoin or Blockchain be able to help resolve the school gun shooting phenomenon in the US, as the technology helps to link and cross check registered firearms when they change hands in the market?

Guns are likely to be around for a proponged period of time, because the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms (plus the firearm companies make billions each year and can spend whatever amount on lobbying, lawsuits and bribery, thats another story).

But imagine in the world of Bitcoin and Blockchain, where each transaction is visible, trackable and decentralised, perhaps the existing source code can be modified, or a new one can be developed, to track the ownership of firearms so they do not fall into the wrong hands, or at least in the event when they do, an alarm will be raised.

Obviously some of the underlying technical details have yet to come to fruition, but the concept itself is solid and is for the general good of all US citizens.

Hopefully the Trump administration can push forward some development along this line, to help minimise future casualties due to firearms, esepcially for the sake of the next generation.

My idea,"Hi guys! My name is Pavel. Recently I decided to develop an electronic racecourse. When developing, I immediately had
such a question:
 1. How to make the game as honest as possible that no one could predict or fake the result of the game?
 2. How to make it so that no one could block the game?
 Solving these issues, I realized that the solutions I found can be used not only in horse races, but also in other games. By
 This is the reason I decided to develop a casino. In this casino, people will play against each other, not against the casino. Casino
 will take a fixed percentage from the rates for providing infrastructure.
 How am I going to ensure the integrity of the game?
 
Firstly it will be an opensourse project. Second, I will use homomorphic encryption, time-lock encryption and blockchain.
The algorithm I developed allows players to take part in the formation of random numbers.
The answer to the second question is the creation of a decentralized network, the nodes of which will be croupiers (bookmakers)
I need people who want to take part in this project. Email me at mail cdc@cdcico.com

 ...rant on related KYC as I just read article on how bitcoin ATM  **make you shove your face** in the f'n cam to verify first.. FFS what have we become..

\-\-\-

If they \(Russia in linked piece\)  had **a private key instead of a custodial relationship** there would be  no need to 'pull' $100B from the fed. \(even states are not allowed freedom from BIS\)  similarly 'our finances' shouldn't be used as a tool of control.  It's beyond privacy its about 'freedom from control and coercion'. 

Allowing any central group of individuals \(elected or otherwise\) **coerce the financial systems \(bitcoin or fiat\) is not a 'western free world'. It's Feudal!** google feudalism and see how well it fits your country \(nation\).  

Don't buy the excuses the lies on how we the people are bad and Ill\-intentioned. \(money laundering lol\)..Just the fact they can not define the crime easily and resort to some MEME 'money laundering' oh my god i got caught washing a dollar in my pocket..  I mean really? Since when do we support a 'the law' that uses memes,  cliches and quite frankly a meaningless phrase. 

It all plays off of 'dirty money'  and according to the dic it means 'money obtained unlawfully or immorally'. Wait a second immorally? wow lets just jail people based on who's idea of morality again? Oh yeah the monopoly men i get it.   Ok stay with it .. its coming   OK 'unlawfully'   OK So now wait a second every time I spend dollars I can be stopped in the middle of the transaction and ask to prove myself and identify myself? Let's stop people at the grocery store then before they check out!  Remember bitcoin is a commodity.NO NO NO that is not Freedom it is not constitutional AT FN all  SO TAKE YOUR kyc AND send it back to totalitarian communist china or other despotic nation of sheep where that kind of Orwellian policy is welcomed.

You catch me 'INJURING someone' and your welcome to detain me but other than that you are acting UNLAWFULLY.   And your 'legal statutes' are Not de jure they are De facto and not consented.. Don't tread on us!

Don't buy the lie that people can not be free and we can not raise public funds voluntarily. \('force'd taxation\)

If 1&amp;#37; or more likely .001&amp;#37; of the population is doing something injurious there are other ways to catch them instead of coercing the 99.99&amp;#37;!  Those who give up their freedom for security deserve neither \- Ben F

Stop Spying on us! \(where are your papers please\)Stop Stealing from us \(give us a &amp;#37; of your labor or go to jail and if you resist we swat you\)

WTF over??

Young people Wake up .. these people you call 'leaders' and 'officials' are predators.  If you think you are part of the club, trust me you aint. Can our societies mind controllers \(mente govern\) stop  stealing, threatening , caging and killing people? Can we deal with that crap locally?

Bitcoin doesn't work and Bitcoin Cash is a fantasy,"Bitcoin doesn't work, it brought to the world a great tech but it obviously doesn't work. In 2017 Bitcoin transitioned from being a currency into being an asset, digital gold. It was intended for it to be used as a trustless peer-to-peer cash system but due to it's deflationary nature it failed to be one. Instead of spending Bitcoins on goods and services people would rather hold their speculative asset in the expectation of getting ROI. Bitcoin Cash and especially Roger Ver has been hammering away at Bitcoin's flaws ever since the hardfork. Accusing Bitcoin's failure as a cash system due to high fee's and technology that doesn't scale. Now Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are both involved in an endless technological debate lashing out at eachother and why one is superior to the other. Although the different paths both coins took are interesting developments and it's  yet to see what the future is for both, they are forgetting the essence of the problem. It isn't that BTC had temporary high fees that it failed as a trustless cash system and Bitcoin Cash promising bigger blocks can't solve that. The problem is that people have been treating Bitcoin as a speculative asset instead of a currency. People even look at you funny when you say you're using Bitcoin as a payment system and I can't see Bitcoin Cash doing anything different as it increases in value and attracts more ''investors''.  The problem with both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is also one of the reasons people we're excited about in the first place, it is deflationary, no more banking cartels ruling the supply and printing money as they please. But whatever you say it is, it doesn't mean people will use it for that purpose. Therefore Bitcoin has proven to not work, to have failed as a trustless cash system and has been dubbed digital gold instead, Bitcoin Cash pretends it has the solution whilst it clearly doesn't see the writing on the wall that eventually, it will suffer the exact same fate as Bitcoin. Why spend something that will keep rising in value?

Skycoin is trying to learn from the mistakes of Bitcoin and I believe it has found a proper solution to the problem. Skycoin which is a decentralized, trustless cash system that is deflationary also generates CoinHours, which is an inflationary coin, each Skycoin generates 1 Coinhour per hour, there's no cap, since coinhours technically won't increase in value forever due to it's lack of scarcity and inflationary nature it is the perfect spending tool used for goods and services. We take the best from both worlds and combine a deflationary coin with an inflationary coin that just like we are used to in cryptocurrency can't be manipulated or controlled, it's output is mathmatically determined ( 1 Coinhour per Skycoin, per hour). Although Skycoin has a lot more to offer it is just this that I want to focus on. Skycoin is the only cryptocurrency on the market right now that has an economic model that makes sense as opposed to all the other coins that will only be hoarded and can't function as a currency.

Bitcoin doesn't work and Bitcoin Cash saying it can solve all the issues of BTC is a fantasy untill they realize what the real problem is, why people aren't using BTC as a currency but as an asset. It wasn't untill I realized this that I figured out that the whole debate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash which everyone is so tired of is flawed to its core. 

With Skycoin and coinhours, inflation is set at a fixed rate, encouraging spending instead of hoarding, people can hoard Skycoin all they want but their coinhours are technically going to decrease in value over time which is why it won't matter to people if they spend it. With Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash there's no economic incentive to spend, only to hoard.

I think this is very important to realize, I think Bitcoin can function as digital gold, the idea that people have something to fall back on when all else fails (governments, banks) is powerfull and shouldn't be neglected but it obviously doesn't work for what it was intended to be. Not to forget this is all highly experimental, results are not guarranteed and we could see a breakdown in Bitcoin when no more people want to join it's network simply because they see no added value in buying a speculative asset and hoping for the price to rise. Cause that is all that is happening right now, nothing more. Still it is a powerfull threat to the establishment and can always serve as a protest when people feel they aren't being listened to.",1526967555,22/05/2018 05:39:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l7n3i/bitcoin_doesnt_work_and_bitcoin_cash_is_a_fantasy/,1

I'm about to open a store that only accepts Bitcoin!,"Hello Everyone at r/Bitcoin
I’ve created an online store that only accepts crypto-currency. I’ve worked really hard on it! I want to have small giveaways and to get a community started and I thought this would be the perfect place to start.
I’m a technology enthusiast and I spend a lot of time reading stock charts. Bitcoin has taken over my life and not in a bad way. I think this is will make my store different because I want to accept other coins too. You can send orders for products with various coins. My goal is to see how many I can collect through trade and barter. This is going to be exciting and I don’t know what to expect. 
I have ideas and I want to include fellow Bitcoin-enthusiasts. It would be great to have your feedback. In the future I would like to petition large businesses to sell things in Bitcoin, and overall make the idea of buying with Bitcoin more mainstream. Would this be good? I think so!
Anyway I don't know how many customers I will get or how much attention this will generate but I want to start slow, so, a Beta-test. 
I will send the link to the first 50 people to PM me. You’re welcome to take a look at the store and tell me what you think. If you would like to buy something that would be great! 
Again, I would really appreciate your feedback. After that I will officially release the store.
Thank you

***Read the information carefully. We are trying to change the world.***

   Skateboard is one of the most popular sport on earth, if not the most one. For sure, if you do not skate, you may know people who does. Skateboards is everywhere, from sport shops to supermarkets. In every town you can find people from different ages and walk of life who skates or had skate before.

   Skateboard games are made since 1999 for different consoles, beginning with PlayStation, and going to Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PC, Game Boy Color, Gameboy Advance, GameCube and Xbox. Every generation have been had an opportunity to be engaged with this great sport. The number of skateboarders in the United States exceeds the millions and much more can skaters easy be found all over the world.

   **The problem to solve**

   You may ask: Where do all these people goes to skate?

   Many cities around the globe, have no skatepark around, or at least an old skatepark with no repairs and care to do. This problem is letting no choice for does who get in love with the sport. So, they ride their skateboards from home to school, to work, around school campus, parking lots, and other areas. For sure it’s not the best places to ride, once it’s a risk for people on the street, for property, for vehicles, and most off all, for skateboarders’ which can get fined, hurt, or worse, once everyone who skates more than a year can share with you a story of bad treatment and life risks situations.

   It is no problem play football at the street, or even ride a bike anywhere, but when you’re are upon a skateboard, the story is different, people normally says: you are free to ride, but not here. So, you may ask: where then?

   Skateboards need to have a place to learn and do their great tricks. It's not a great problem to ride from a place to another, once the local law allows it, but for an enthusiastic of any kink, player or sportsman, if your city doesn’t have a spot to practice, your city could become one.

   The Skateboarders commonly are seen for society as outcasts, and nuisances, but guess what? we are the society, and we can make the difference.

   2. The Skateboarding solution

   2.1. The Skatepark

   People normally thinks that there is so few people looking for solving the skateboard problem, but to solve a generalized problem you don’t need more than a few people here and there to gather a crowd to help. There is why, YourOllie.com stands up to make this crowd get united in a purpose: Help skateboard community to grown and be respected.

   2.2. What a Skateboard park is for?

   The definition of a Park can be fund as: ""A park is an area of natural, semi\-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats."" A Skateboard Park is useful for all those things and much more. Let’s see the full Picture:

   2.2.1. As a Skateboarder perspective, a skatepark is a safe and nice environment for practice the sport.

   Numerous accidents have been occurred with Skateboarder outside of skatepark as been injuries at falls in to not appropriate surface, and collisions with pedestrians and car.

   2.2.2. As a parent’s perspective, a skatepark is a way to reduce illicit behavior, and a contained place for the good sake of their children.

   The discipline found in sports, and the sense of purpose and group participation that apply there, allows the individual to abstain from problems and to develop in a sustainable way as an active citizen. Keep the youth active is the best way to keep they out of trouble.

   2.2.3. As a neighborhood perspective, a skatepark avoid damage in to private property.

   It's should not be a problem, but it is, and plenty videos on social media can be seen where private property is damage by skateboarders. The question here is not the behavior of some skaters who disrespect other’s people property, but what can be done to avoid that situation.

   Be disrespectful is a problem to be solve at home, but no one can break in to 

somebody homes to teach their children a lesson, but we can provide the youth an attractive place where they can be attracted to, in order to avoid private property.

   It is well stablished that we will not be able to solve this property situation completely, but we can help good youth and parents to chill a bit that now that their children will not cause any trouble for themselves, and other people.

   2.2.4. As a healthcare professional perspective, a Skatepark promotes physical and mental health.

   No one can argue that sports need to make part of our lives. The implications of sedentary body can cost more than a scary health problem to most people. For a very long time, doctor and specialists have been begging the society to improve their life style, adding to it, a healthy sport practice.

   Diseases as:

\(A\)\- Diabetes; who includes a large portion of society: It can be stated that 1 in 11 adults has diabetes \(425 million\). 1 in 2 adults with diabetes is undiagnosed \(212 million\). 1 in 6 births is affected by hyperglycemia in pregnancy.

\(B\)\- Heart disease; who took a globally portion of 422.7 million prevalent cases of cardiovascular disease just in 2015.

\(C\)\- Obesity; who currently afflicts 21.8&amp;#37; of the total global population and 33.9&amp;#37; of the US.

\(D\)\- Sedentary lifestyle: It can be stated that 12 hours, is the amount of time the average person is sitting a day, therefor the sedentary lifestyle is guilty of 3.2 million deaths a year and it is the 4th leading risk factor for global mortality.

The amount collected, its purposes and the way it will be used is in total responsibility of Yourollie.com

The token distribution will be made to say thank you for the ones who believed and donate for the project.

The Token purpose will be expanding as the community grown.

The donation is going to continue a month later after the first phase donation until all Thank You Token is gone. The token will continue to be distributed with a new price rate after the first phase donation based on the trading value of the month, week or day.

Once the donation is the focus here, after the last Token from the 8.000.000.000 Ollie Tokens be given to say thank you for our donors, the announce of the last Thank You Token given will be proper made in all our social media channels, and the site will close donation for a week. After a week donation closed, the donation will be reopened, but without Thank You Token distribution.

Since beginning of distribution 800.000.000 Ollie Token will be locked for 5 years for long term sustainability purpose.

The tokens that are going to be given to skateboarders sponsored by yourollie.com will be bought at common price on the market, and then used to be distributed among sponsored skateboarders. This will be one way to continue to providing liquidity to the Ollie Token.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

The youollie.com continues support this project even though fund raising does not reach its minimum of 8 million dollars.

Invest in propaganda for the project.

To open yourollie.com online Skate Shop in order to pay the expenses and 

make the payment of the cost aid of the team behind the project, to sustain the site, and to give Ollie token its first utility in real world.

\-If donations reach from 80 million to 800 million the donation will be used to:

Everything planning for the project are ready to happen! Here everything will happen in the proportion to the amount of donation reached.

The number proposed of skate park to be built with maximum donation reached is 400, but the number can be changed for at least 250 parks to double the number of skateparks in the world. The maximum value to be voted by the community for the approval of the construction of a new skatepark will be equal to the remaining value of funds divided by the remaining number of parks to reach the minimum number of 250 parks.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

The Proposal is, at least 1 skatepark project will approved and build every month. \(An yourollie.com team member or partner will be responsible to follow the new construction, and the next one could begin sooner or later, depends on the time the construction time will be needed to finish with perfection the job planed\).

For a faster growth in the number of parks built we will seek to increase the number of team members and partners.

The community can also help in the constructions, if able to, to save money for 

upcoming park constructions.

The different reserves we have are:

Reserve made to Build Skateparks

Reserve made to Technical and team development.

Reserve made to Our sponsor program.

Reserve made to Advertisement.

Reserve made to Ollie Token liquidity.

Reserve made to Help local skate shops.

Reserve made to Global Events.

**7. Liquidity proposal:**

![img](6y0mkkfk4ez01)

7.1. Ollie Token; Liquidity proposal:   YourOllie.com will receive funds from donors. The funds will be manager in USD and the coins that was received at first phase donation in order to guarantee a smooth work all over the years. Once the YourOllie.com want to make a transfer to donate for constructions, sponsored skateboarders, events, help skate shops or pay for advertisement from reserve funds, after community election, Then The Ollie Token are going to be bought from an exchange in order to transfer the funds.

   The constructions expenses, sponsored skateboarders, event expenses, skate shops donations or advertisement expenses will be paid with Ollie Token, or in other ways if impossible for the service provider, which will be a rare exception. Once the goal here is to make the Ollie Token useful throughout the community.

   Once the constructions expenses, sponsored skateboarders, event expenses, skate shops donations or advertisement expenses, the new owner of the token will choose what to do with the token received, which can be: save the tokens and accumulate them, purchase products, transfer for other people, to vote in the Ollie system or change for other currencies, which will bring the token for an exchange and make it circulate even more.

   In the first phase of donations, only crypto will be accepted.

   In the first phase of donations the Ollie Token will be distributed as a way to say thank you for donors.

   In the second phase of donations, crypto and local currencies will be accepted.

   In the second phase of donations the RVs will be distributed as a way to say thank you for donors.

   RV means voting right and will be used in the election as an alternative way to participate in the Ollie elections.

   The voting system was made to replenish capital in all reserve funds for future donations and use.

   10&amp;#37; of the voting system will be used to replenish Development and Team reserves.

   7.2. Voting System Explained

   The YourOllie.com Voting System was developed with the Intent to replenish reserve funds for future projects and to keep the system working in a sustainable and decentralized manner.

   At first, the value of the vote will be tied to the full value of each Ollie Token, this value will be reviewed every 3 months for the good of the progress and long\-term sustainability of the diverse projects presented here.

   Members of the YourOllie.com community and other participants of the crypto\-coin world could participate without initial restrictions on the voting of the projects. Interventions and restrictions may be added in the future if the decentralization of votes is greatly affected.

   The vote will be concluded after a minimum quota of votes made by the community and it may be extended for some months until the conclusion of the minimum quota of votes for a given project.

   The minimum quota of votes will be stipulated considering the size of the investment to be made in the voting process. Every minimum quota will be presented by YourOllie.com team before the opening of each project for election.

   Any owner of Ollie Tokens can participate in elections to approve community projects using their tokens.

   The donors who made a contribution for the development of YourOllie.com and their projects, at the second phase donation, will not receive any Ollie Token, but they will have received in a way of gratitude The Right of Vote \(RV\) in the Community.

   RV is the abbreviation determined in the system to designate The Right to Vote.

   Even without Ollie Token to take part in the election, these donors, mentioned above, will have access to another easy and quick way to participate in the elections.

   The amount of Right to Vote received by the second phase donors will be tied to the amount donated. One Right to Vote for each dollar donated.

   A Right to Vote always will represent a contribution of one dollar in the vote system.

   The Right to vote do not represent a complete vote, once each vote are linked with the Ollie Token Price. So, a Right to Vote could be worth more than a vote or less than a vote according with the Ollie Token Price.

   The number of coins or voting rights used by a single portfolio to participate in the most diverse elections shall not exceed 20&amp;#37; of the minimum value proposed to finalize the voting.

   If a portfolio is responsible for donating 20.01&amp;#37; or more of the minimum value to complete the election, the portfolio in question must prove that the address is bestowed on a group of persons and not just on an individual.

   The calculation made to account the Right to vote in an election will be simple:

   Each Token that represent the Right to vote will be represented for one dollar.

   The value corresponding to the effectuation of a vote will be linked to the value of a Ollie Token.

   According to Ollie Token's quotation on vote counting day, the total number of Right to vote will be counted and divided by the effective value of Ollie Token. The results will be the number of votes to be added to the default voting system made through the Ollie Tokens.

**8. Reserve Explained**

The reserve fund was created to meet the most diverse needs of the community. Thus, the value they find there is entirely intended for the purposes by which they were stored.

Each reserve fund will be replenished through the project election system.

Each project will have the funds raised in its election to help keep the project fund in constant use and replenishment so that the global improvements proposed by this project can last in the long term

The expenses related to lodging, food and travel two supervisors of the construction of skate parks and supervisors used to accompany the reform and implementation of skate shops, will be part of each fund and its area of development and support.

The expenses of the reserve funds will be opened to the community so that the members of the community can analyze the data and vote with more awareness and conviction in the following proposals.

Incredibly one sided bashing article in Germany's biggest online news SPIEGEL ONLINE featuring a PwC interview,"http://m.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/bitcoin-energieverbrauch-fuer-produktion-und-verwaltung-a-1208635.html

One sided in terms of energy consumption of mining regarded as money generation instead of security factor. Also old references to ""general transaction cost"" of tens of dollars with example from December 2017.  
General view is economy and price related but not a tiny bit about technolgy. The interview partner of PricewarerhouseCoopers also refers bitcoin as a bad payment option while not even mentioning Lightning. He is also suggestioning an Uno resolution against bitcoin ming what is correlated to killing the protocol security.

Bitcoin for pizzas?,"I'll pay 10,000 pizzas for a couple of bitcoins.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next decades. I like having left over bitcoin to hodl on later. You can mine the bitcoin yourself and send it to my address or order it for me from an exchange, but what I'm aiming for is getting bitcoin delivered in exchange for pizzas where I don't have to mine or buy it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to hodl on and you're happy!

I can make things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.

If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.

Why are there no zero comission centralised exchanges?,Now please bear with me for a minute here. The centralised exchanges like coinbase take a cut of all profits so there is a perverse incentive for them to offline when there is a dip and the higher the transaction the more that is taken. This stops those who want to sell and those who want to buy low meeting during a dip. Now decentralised exchanges are attempt to solve this but they lack the liquidity in their order book and they don't have funds to spend in marketing to bring more traders in so why are there no exchanges that charge a flat monthly fee and no comission?,1526991007,22/05/2018 12:10:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8l9hju/why_are_there_no_zero_comission_centralised/,1

We are happy to announce The 2018 CoinsBank Mediterranean Blockchain cruise,"Are you ready for yet another amazing cruise? **CoinsBank** is proud to present the 3rd edition of the **CoinsBank Blockchain Cruise** that will be held from the 7th to 11th of September, 2018. The 4-day cruise out of **Barcelona (Spain)** and visiting **Monaco (Monte Carlo)** and **Ibiza**.

Just like the **2018 Asia Cruise**, the **Mediterranean cruise** will bring together hundreds of industry professionals, renowned thought leaders, and blockchain enthusiasts from all over the world. The cruise will be a perfect opportunity to relax and at the same time learn about the latest trends in blockchain investing. **The Blockchain Cruise** is aimed at accelerating the growth of the blockchain community by facilitating the formation of meaningful relationships between its members. What’s better than having a one on one with a Bitcoin expert over some expensive champagne while looking at the endless waters of the Mediterranean? You guessed it; Nothing!

As Bloomberg commented:
*""By the time their 1,020-foot-long ship pulled into Thailand on Wednesday, for an afternoon of bottomless drinks and crypto-focused talks on a sun-soaked private beach, Bitcoin had cratered to $10,000€!. But if anyone was fazed, they didn’t show it. The party rolled on as the sangria and Red Bull flowed, Bitcoin-themed rap music blared and drones filmed it all from above.""*
 
Sounds cool, but it’s not enough. So **Coinsbank** decided to be over heads and do this conference better.
 

**The Ship and Venues**

The cruise will be held in a state of the art 2500 capacity cruise ship that has everything you could ever want or need on a cruise ship. The entire cruise vessel reserved for the event only to ensure as many blockchain enthusiasts get the opportunity to enjoy this amazing adventure. The spacious rooms, gorgeous observation decks, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, magnificent food and entertainment options are designed to help you make the most of the cruise. 
 
 
**The Route**

This is definitely the best part! The Mediterranean blockchain cruise shall depart from Barcelona to its first destination, Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo is one of the highlights of the cruise as it lets you experience the best of French and Italian cultures in the midst of pure luxury. The ship shall then head over to Ibiza for the whole day conference and crazy party at the paradise beach on this magnificent island. And at least, making the final trip back to beautiful Barcelona. 
Each of these destinations is a world-class destination on its own and can be found in the Top 10 list of the best tourist destinations in the world. The cruise gives you the chance to experience the beauty of these places while listening to insightful cryptocurrencies discussions by industry leaders and experts. 
 
 
**The Speakers**
 
Over 100 speakers with extensive knowledge about the world of crypto have been invited. The speakers consist of government representatives, blockchain advisers, top lawyers in the field, trading experts, investing and venture funds, powerful political figures, media representatives and bloggers, among other crypto experts. You will learn more about matters like emerging cryptocurrencies and their effect on the leading cryptocurrencies, the latest trends in cryptocurrencies, expert predictions on the future of blockchain, tools and techniques of trading your digital assets, among other interesting blockchain topics. The speakers’ combination of experience and expertise will help the guests see the picture from many angles and maintain candid discussions. 
 
 
**Entertainment** 
 
Besides all talks, business and conferences, the ship and the program of the whole trip are fully packed with entertainment options for the guests. World-famous DJs, celebrities, great party at the Pool Deck, 24 hours open bar reception, show time, dinners and as the cherry on top - unforgettable party at the beautiful Ibiza beach.

Happy bitcoin-pizza day,"Today is a historic day for the bitcoin industry. Eight years ago the programmer Laszlo Heinitz made perhaps the craziest purchase in the entire existence of bitcoin-bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. However, in 2010-this purchase did not seem to be something out of the ordinary, except that it was paid in digital currency.



Traditionally, on the 22 of May many crypto-enthusiasts buy pizza “Papa Jones” (it was in this restaurant Heinitz bought his pizza) and remember this event, which marked the beginning of the actual use of bitcoin as a means of payment, and also talk about the future prospects of the crypto industry.



Today, the amount of 10 000 BTC is a very solid amount (a little more than $80 million at the current market rate), usually with such figures on the Bank account people are included in the Forbes lists.



What do you think Laszlo Heinitz would buy today if there was find such a sum in his wallet?

The first non-crypto exchange to list Bitcoin will dominate Bitcoin trading.,"Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange etc

These proper real world exchanges have liquid transactions in over trillions USD a day. If any one of these exchanges decided to step in and list Bitcoin, the institutional/hedge fund money is going to flow directly into that and whichever exhange (within a country) does that first will so have the first mover advantage and dominate the trading of Bitcoin within that country.

Onviously settlement is an issue as Bitcoin is not a traditional asset but at the end of the day it is not rocket scienece. They just need to build a Bitcoin settlement system, may cost 1-2 billion USD but the feed will definitely more than cover.

I believe the reason why this is still not done is because of the usual political power struggle between the governemnt and the financial sector. Once they come to a resolution we will no longer need Coinbase as everyone will have direct access to trading on the normal exchanges.",1527009303,22/05/2018 17:15:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lbp8t/the_first_noncrypto_exchange_to_list_bitcoin_will/,1

Where is the money??,"Ok, its time to start being rational. I have seen so many posts over the last few months, especially since the BTC futures launced in December, that institutional money is coming. Yet no new money has come into the market in 5 months... Anyone a bit concerned by this?
 Everyone who posts this stuff always says its coming soon, like they know something, but they know nothing or they wouldnt be so vague with their timeframe. Part of me suspects its just their way of trying to prop up the price in a faltering market. The crypto market seems to be driven by misinformation, rumours, and downright lies. 
Also, during the boom of late 2017, there were supposedly huge backlogs of new investors trying  to get onto exchanges, they all anounced  restrictions on new accounts in a seemingly coordinated way, and since then, there has been nothing, no public updates from exchanges regarding new sign ups etc... The CEO of Binance claimed they signed up over 100,000 new accounts in a 4 hour window at one stage. If all this was true, how is it that more money has left crypto than has entered?

Saifedean Ammous - Introduction to crypto-currencies,"Maybe people probably have heard of Saifedean, he's the author of ""The Bitcoin Standard"". But I also really like this video of him explaining some basic economic concepts of Bitcoin and what they mean: 

https://vimeo.com/239856912

I've just watched it again for, maybe the 5th or 6th time and this point really stuck:

The reason why gold became the money in free competition between all stuffs that can be used as money, is because it is the hardest to increase the supply of, if the price rises because of increase in demand. That's it. If the demand for copper rises, the price rises, more resources go into mining copper and the supply increases, so the price normalizes again. That is also true for gold, but not as much, because it's harder to increase the supply of gold, so *naturally* that's what people use to store their wealth.

With bitcoin it's not harder to increase the supply greater than what the protocol has set in stone. It is *impossible*. It is the hardest money every invented.

To everybody who's in red because you bought during the last bull run, or to anybody losing perspective, or to anybody who's on the fence: if you ask me, this is the time to loading up on bitcoin as hard as you can. It's only 2 years to the next halving.",1527023429,22/05/2018 21:10:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ldnfo/saifedean_ammous_introduction_to_cryptocurrencies/,1

To the TA folsk...,"When are you guys going to realize that the price of bitcoin is dependent on two things. Which side the coin lands on, and where the darts land on the board. Because this is how bitcoins price is determined.... 

Somewhere there exists a room, and in this room, there are men. Every day, these men have two important objectives. First, they gather round a table in a circle, and on this table is a box. From this box, a coin is produced. On one side, there is a green vertical bar. On the other side is a red one. Next, the spinner from the game twister is pulled from the box. It is placed on the table, and given a spin by the previous days coin flipper. The person who it is pointing towards when it comes to a rest, is the days Market Maker. This person is handed the coin, and flips it high into the air. The previous result of the coin flip is irrelevant. What has happened the day before belongs to yesterday. What happens today, belongs to the coin. Ah, it has landed on Red Bar. One of the men from the circle exclaims, "" So it has been decided, today the market will go down!"" ""huzzah!"" say the rest. 

Then, a a dart is pulled from the box. The one who flipped the coin is handed the dart. He then walks to a line that is drawn twenty meters from a board with hundreds of numbers on it ranging from 0 all the way to 2000. The majority of the numbers represented fall between 0-500. With a couple spots on the board reserved for values between 501-2000. There is one spot in the middle which says ""wild"". This leaves the decision up to the days tosser. 

He lets the dart fly. ""Thud"". Cheers erupt from the others, as one man announces ""It is settled. Today, bitcoin will drop by $350"". 

The group of men then goes to a computer, clicks a red button on the screen that says down, enters 350 into another box, and then pushes a button that says ""Delayed bot activation +1 Hr"". Then, they exit the room, walk down a long tunnel, and up a set of stairs, and out a set of storm doors, emerging into the bright morning sun. Beneath their feet, is sand. Nearby waves crash upon a pristine shoreline, completely untouched by footprints. Two of the men push one another as they race to the waters edge, laughing every step of the way. 

At the same time, thousands of men across the world sit in front of their computers, drawing lines, circles, triangles.... making calculations...applying formulas...intersecting arrows and blobs.. and any number of other methods to try to predict something. Something that was already decided an hour ago on a small, undisclosed island in the southeast pacific.",1527024272,22/05/2018 21:24:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ldrca/to_the_ta_folsk/,1

We have created a new kind of Bitcoin wallet which uses an extra phone for cold wallet functionality. Would love to get some feedback from the community.,"During the last couple of months, we have been working on a project which we think will lower the barrier to entry into the world of highly secure Bitcoin storage.

We call our solution COINiD, and it is a regular Bitcoin wallet, but it can also work in cold wallet mode by signing transactions using a completely offline phone. In short, we separate the private key from the actual wallet and store it in a separate app that we call the COINiD Vault that handles the signing.

A video might do it more justice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3iuELMSW1w

Anyhow, we would love to get some help testing it and are announcing public early access today. So if you are interested in trying it out, please sign up on https://coinid.org, and you’ll get an invite to our iOS TestFlight, you will then be able to install either the Testnet Wallet or the Bitcoin Wallet.

Oh yeah, currently we have the iOS version ready for testing. We will announce the Android version soon.

If you have any questions, I’ll be happy to answer them here.",1527029055,22/05/2018 22:44:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lecnn/we_have_created_a_new_kind_of_bitcoin_wallet/,1

My friend blamed me for losing a lot of money on Bitcon. I made a crypto card game about losing your money to rub salt in his wounds,"The thing that annoys me most in the world is uneducated Bitcoin investors. And I have a hell of a story about one in particular.

I invested in Bitcoin at the end of 2016, times were good. As the price began to go up my friends would ask a lot of questions about what Bitcoin was and how it worked. I answered honestly, not trying to sway either way. At the end of last year at the peak of its upwards curve one of my close friends decided he had to get in the game, and took at a $7,000 low interest government university loan to buy Bitcoin, thinking the price would soon be over six figures. Dreaming of getting rich quick, and DEFINITELY investing more than he could lose it was obviously a recipe for disaster.

Price drops, he loses two thirds of his investment, and no blames me solely for losing that money on Bitcoin. 

What did I do?

I was so fed up with his whinging on our group chat of friends, that I created a card game called Bitcon to simulate losing your money investing in crypto. I took it to uni saying now he could lose his money with out actually losing his money.

One of our friends (a graphic designer/videographer) loved the idea and offered to help me actually make it into a game. I jumped at the chance to keep the prank going longer. We designed the cards, created graphics and a cool video, and this morning launched the game on Kickstarter. The first person I messaged? The original idiot still crying about losing his cash. 

Not sure how to keep the prank going on any longer (all suggestions welcome!) but we created a version of the game exclusively for Kickstarter where we print the dumbest things people have said or done with bitcoin on each card. My friend is the first comment on there.

Would A Crypto Bear Market Be good This Year?,"Watch the video if you prefer audio, or read my article below!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvula9FiT\_U&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvula9FiT_U&amp;t)

  Hey, Average Investor here. Today I wanted to talk about if I think a bear market would be good in the crypto space. 

To start this off I think it is important to not think of this as FUD, but rather talking about a healthy market cycle. Also, you're within the 5&amp;#37; of the world using and investing into this technology, so you likely have a very bright future in this space.

  Every year in any sort of market you're involved in you should expect a a correction. As well as about every 5 years for there to be a crash. Bear markets can typically last about a year, but obviously  this space is relatively new and unpredictable. But the important thing to note is that if you do sell, then you will lose. Fear and uncertainty in any space can lead you you making irrational decisions.  Maybe getting out of the market too soon, or maybe even putting in more than you can afford. As well as being too impatient on returns for an investment. 

  Diversity is extremely important to consider no matter what market you're entering. Always expect any investment you have to drop  50\-70&amp;#37; at any given time. Hedging funds into traditional assets like property, stocks, gold, silver etc can be very beneficial to minimize losses. As well as have a large diversity within your crypto assets. 

  While the market is down there are many things that can be very beneficial to investors. For starters you will have much more time to understand crypto itself. There are so many developing projects in this space it can be hard to wrap your head around all of them. Also, you can make sure that your projects your holding or planning to hold are showing real progress and real use. I have seen many new uses and updates on projects I am very interested in like civic, steem, and basic attention token. This time will allow many things such as EOS mainnet to come out, further development in things like golem, ada, and many others. As well as give time for more adoption to the lighting network and many more projects. 

  Another big thing a bear market will do is allow you a lot of time to accumulate. I personally always try and invest in bitcoin around $6k and lower. While this market has provided quite a few opportunities for that, I feel if it continues there will be more chances to accumulate around there. As well as allowing people with new interest or lower income to get involved without high premiums. I have a lot of friends getting into the space and I simply suggest to them to pull aside $10 every check and toss it into crypto to help get a  feel for the market. Which is not very risky as they may only have to give up two coffees to do it each paycheck. I also help them get started in investing with robinhood, which gives them a free stock starting out.

Two Aussies create 'Bitcon' a card game that replicates losing all your money with Bitcoin,"The thing that annoys me most in the world is uneducated Bitcoin investors. And I have a hell of a story about one in particular. Contains quite a bit of dry Australian humour.

I invested in Bitcoin at the end of 2016, times were good. As the price began to go up my friends would ask a lot of questions about what Bitcoin was and how it worked. I answered honestly, not trying to sway either way. At the end of last year at the peak of its upwards curve one of my close friend decided he had to get in the game, and took at a $7,000 low interest government university loan to buy Bitcoin, thinking the price would soon be over six figures. Well that was a great fucking idea wasn't it.

Dreaming of getting rich quick, and DEFINITELY investing more than he could lose it was obviously a recipe for disaster. I must say it is mildly amusing that the government now has him by the balls because of a completely unregulated cryptocurrency..


Price drops, he loses two thirds of his investment, and now  blames me solely for losing that money on Bitcoin.

What did I do?

I was so fed up with his whinging on our group chat of friends, that I created a card game one night called 'Bitcon' to simulate losing your money investing in crypto. I took it to uni saying now he could lose his money with out actually losing his money.

A Promising Blockchain technology :Ink Protocol,"nk Protocol an innovative and Promising Blockchain project can be integrated into new or existing marketplaces and can also be used in marketplaces that don’t directly handle payments.
Ink Protocol doesn’t require a marketplace. It can be used for any peer-to-peer transaction, regardless of where it happens.
Ink Protocol helps users safely send and receive payments in P2P marketplaces while earning public reputation for every completed transaction.
Sellers can take their earned reputation with them from marketplace to marketplace.
To ensure sellers’ reputations are credible, feedback may only be given on completed transactions.
Ink Protocol’s built-in dispute resolution allows a mediator to be assigned to a transaction. Mediators exist as independent Smart Contracts and are jointly agreed upon by the buyer and seller.
With mediation, payment is held in escrow until the buyer confirms the transaction. In the event of a dispute, the mediator works with both parties to decide on an outcome.

"Stop-limit order question , help please!","i have a newbi question so please bear with me,
what if coin X is being traded at 1200 usd,i want to place a stop-limit sell order in case the coin's price goes down while i am sleeping so i place my stop at 1000 and limit order sell at 998 , now what if someone decided to crash the coin's price by selling some coins at a ridiculously low price (800 usd) for example , my understanding is that he will sell at 800 and then the price will go back instantly to the next buy/sell pair which should be around the ""normal"" 1200 usd that the coin was being traded at, but by doing this ridiculous sell doesn't that trigger all the stops placed between 800-1200 usd? my understanding is that the stop gets triggered when the ""last market price"" reaches the or below the stop the person had placed.
so for example if coin X is being traded at 1200 usd , jack had a stop at 950 with limit sell order at 948 , bad guy comes and sells a coin at 800, making the ""last market price"" 800 , doesn't that mean jack's stop has been triggered and his coins will be placed as a limit order to be sold at 948 usd? when in fact the coin is being traded at around 1200 , doesn't that mean it will be sold instantly along with the other stop-limit sell orders placed between 800-1200 , initiating a lot of under market price sell limit orders (which should be filled really fast ) forcing people to sell for a cheap price and possibly crashing the coins price?

The juvenile paradox,"Yesterday, there were more than 35 topics on this subreddit to do with this so called ""pizza day"", where many people posted images of themselves eating pizza to celevrate bitcoin. Doesnt this sort of stuff just reinforce the perception of some that the bitcoin community is just  a bunch of immature, juvenile  computer geeks trading imaginary coins amongst themselves?
We keep hearing that insitutional money is coming, yet how can bitcoin be treated as a legitimate asset and attain respect when we are obsessed with how somebody bought pizza with bitcoin a few years ago? Im not trying to be a killjoy here, but when people say that bitcoin is an immature market, I can see that they mean it in the literal sense too.

Bitcoin for Ransom - South Africa's first case,"A 13 year old South African boy(Katlego Marite) was kidnapped whiled playing with his friends outside of his home on the 23rd May 2018. What makes this case quite interesting is that the kidnappers they want ransom paid in Bitcoin. Yup, you heard it right, they want at staggering total of 15 bitcoins for the safe release of the boy. That is around 1.5 million rands they asking for.

Their terms as laid out in their ransom letter are that 1 bitcoin must be paid by midnight of 23rd May 2018 and the want the remaining balance or the bitcoins by the 27th May 2018.

I have been following the bitcoin address where they asked the ransom to be paid into so far and what I have established is that the 1 bitcoin payment they have requested has been paid already. Please see the link below for the kidnappers bitcoin wallet:

The story is on the official South African Police Service(SAPS) twitter account, link is below:

The ransom letter with the bitcoin wallet address of the kidnappers can be seen in the link below:

Am kindly appealing to the Reddit community at large to help trace the funds as they move [this address](https://blockchain.info/address/3GEBeMBU9oMu9dunS8ArmvHDpyn327DipH). The kidnappers are at some point would want to exchange the bitcoins for cash via an exchange. If you guys can assist in tracing the transactions hopefully the information can lead us somewhere. 

Lets keep the young Katlego in our prayers. God bless.

Paypal is non-volatile, truly secure unlike 4 million forever lost btc, globally used with fair exchange rates, is instant, has zero transaction fee option, has debit and 2% cash back credit cards. How can crypto ever offer a better solution to a problem that doesn't really exist?

Question Regarding Recovery of Breadwallet,"I am really hoping you guys can help me out. Here is the situation:

I had a BTC wallet via Breadwallet that I used successfully before without issue. Earlier this week I requested a BTC payment from a source using my Breadwallet address. Went to Verizon to upgrade my phone the next day (iPhone 7 -&gt; iPhone X) and wrote down the 12 word recovery key beforehand. 

I redownloaded the Breadwallet app and used the recovery phrase successfully. The next day I got notification that the transaction had been completed. I tried to sync with the Blockchain but it did not seem to be making progress (I now realize that it takes much longer to sync then I originally though), so I removed the wallet so that I could re-recover it and try to re-sync it.

However now when I try to recover the wallet it states that the 12 word key is invalid. I used the [BTC Recovery Phrase Tool](https://jmacwhyte.github.io/recovery-phrase-recovery/) using what I had written down and it said that the key was associated with a wallet. I have tried multiple times to recover it but it keeps returning the key invalid message.

Can anyone provide additional insight into how I can recover my funds?",1527083356,23/05/2018 13:49:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ljhwo/question_regarding_recovery_of_breadwallet/,1

Refutation of bitcoin,"All arguments in favor of bitcoin are false.

1) ""It's just like the dollar, i.e. it's valuable because masses decided so.""

Wrong. The dollar can pay federal taxes. Bitcoin can't.

2) ""It's just like gold, i.e. it's valuable because masses agreed so.""

Actually, gold has intrinsic value. Bitcoin has none.

3) ""It's limited in quantity.""

Scarcity actually isn't enough to prove value. If someone offered you a 1/1 limited edition used toilet paper, you would bid $0 even though it's a 1/1 limited edition.

4) ""It's convenient.""

Convenience isn't enough to prove value. If person A tries to smuggle a ton of gold and fails, and person B tries to smuggle a piece of used toilet paper and succeeds, that convenience doesn't prove value.


As you can see, all pro-bitcon argumengs are false, and it will be headed to Zero.",1527085108,23/05/2018 14:18:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ljpwa/refutation_of_bitcoin/,1

What's your favorite explaination of Bitcoin?,"I'm surprised that I couldn't find any explaination of Bitcoin for dummies that really goes into depth on how it works. All I could find was explainations of how there's a ledger and everyone has access to it so it can't be changed. If you never heard of Bitcoin that really doesn't help. 

Where is this ledger exactly?

How do I reach the ledger when I send a transaction?

I know how Bitcoin works but I want to have an explaination to show somebody that doesn't know anything about it and also doesn't have any knowledge of Bitcoin. What's your go\-to explaination text or video?",1527090780,23/05/2018 15:53:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lkg0r/whats_your_favorite_explaination_of_bitcoin/,1

Bitcoin Core &amp; Lightning Network (very easy installation!) No root access!,"Hi!

  
I finished the fine tools as i think

I created Makefile utilities for bitcoind &amp; lnd compilation under $HOME directory \(**no root access**!\)  
**This makefile does everything for full bitcoin node and lightning network node**. It kit was create for CentOS 6.\* but it works in Ubuntu / Linux Mint OSes too and may be will work in 90&amp;#37; Unix systems.

*Details:*

It compiles from sources under $HOME directory: compilers \(gcc 7.1\) and tools \(autoconf &amp; autotools and etc\), all libraries, bitcoind daemon \(and boost library\), lnd daemon \(and golang compiler and python2 &amp; python3\), lncli\-web client \(and node.js for this\) and does all configuaration! It works fine with UPnP \(from sources too!\)

So if you have bitcoind &amp; lnd node you need only to do:

**make i\-want\-lightning**

**make set\-up\-lightning\-mainnet**

And after you can run ***mainnet\-lightning\-start*** 

You can setup in one host mainnet &amp; testnet daemons fithout conflicts.  


Enjoy!

MTGox dumping coins,"This is not an attack on MTGox. I appreciate the fact that they are giving compensation back to their erstwhile users, but I honestly believe that the price drop has been due largely to this dumping of the coins they had.

To put it in perspective, the volume on GDAX currently sits at 10650 bitcoins (https://www.gdax.com/trade). This is far lower than the peaks of around 35000 in December of last year. Low volume and lots of sells leads to a lower market price (at least in the short term).

MTGox has been selling about 2000 coins from their wallets on a routine basis since they got the clear to give compensation to users. They have a total of right around 200,000 coins. This is 20 times the volume on GDAX, enough to significantly affect the market.

Additionally, the price of bitcoin was on a steady rise before MTGox was given the go-ahead, rising from 4-12-18 to 5-5-18 (https://fnordprefekt.de/).

In short, the liquidity of the market is exceptionally low right now. Thus, even a small sale of bitcoins relatively speaking (2000 bitcoins by MTGox) can drastically reduce the price.

Take away: this price decrease, as usual, is temporary, and perhaps has a discernible cause. Once more, this is not an attack on MTGox, merely an attempt to reduce misery (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-misery-index.asp) by giving the community a clear reason for the suffering.

You can disagree with me, but please present evidence. Downvoting simply because you're angry or depressed only spreads misery and makes things worse. The toughest thing to do for most is, when you are miserable, do the OPPOSITE thing that caused you to be miserable, when interacting with others. Usually we just project what we're feeling inside, because misery loves company.",1527091177,23/05/2018 15:59:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lkhxl/mtgox_dumping_coins/,1

The power of the state and the role of Bitcoin,"Many conversations are about cryptocurrency's lack of dependence on the authority of the state. 

As a form of ""guerilla currency"", cryptocurrency's decentralized nature means that it doesn't require a central authority to function. It doesn't require trust in anything more than the technology, and access to it, to operate. 

But the power of the State should not be ignored. The State has tremendous power to influence what currency is used in daily transactions, and currency is an extremely powerful tool. Currency is also a tool that minimizes the amount of trust you have to have in the people you transact with: you may not trust somebody buying a good or service from you, but you can trust the value of the currency they offer for your good/service! 

When managed well, currency is highly effective at stimulating the production of wealth and status! Take a look at the tremendous wealth generated by the Megastates - the United States, Europe, and now China. Perhaps the most valuable export of the United States is its currency which has become a defacto global reserve currency. United States debt is highly valuable. 

Cryptocurrency like bitcoin **may** become a sort of global reserve currency, some would argue that's already starting to happen, BUT that will be a subtle, iterative dance that will involve heavy intervention by the State. 

The most obvious power that a State has to stimulate adoption of its currency is to issue it. Most (but not all) governments have done this around the world. To encourage its use, a State can require that their currency be used to pay debts to the state. EG taxes. And so long as the State maintains this requirement, their currency will always have value. 

I own land, I earn wealth as a knowledge worker, I therefore pay taxes, and as a US citizen, that must be paid in US Dollars. And, everybody I'm likely to transact with has the same ultimate interest - to pay their state dues in US Dollars, and so even if we find another medium to transact in (EG: Bitcoin) that value will ultimately, have to be converted to US Dollars to pay the tax dues. 

So there's a HUGE incentive to just use the fiat currency issued by the State! And the State has HUGE incentive to maintain its own currency: having the power to issue currency allows the state to use inflation, deflation, state sponsored lending, and other tools to increase economic activity, deal with debt, fund wars, and numerous other activities. 

Much vaunted, Bitcoin doesn't offer these advantages. The number of Bitcoins available isn't determined by the needs and whims of the State, it's determined by an algorithm that is effectively immutable, as evidenced by the vast number of Bitcoin forks that have failed to gather any confidence whatsoever. 

For cryptocurrency to truly replace the currencies of the State, it needs to address the needs of the State as well as the needs of the consumers and sellers. And, technically speaking, this is not terribly hard to do. 

The algorithm that doles out coin to miners could, for example, be modified to include distribution of coin by the state to miners. The ability to ""create money out of thin air"" by privileged institutions (Banks) in the United States could be coded into the logic of a state-sanctioned cryptocurrency. And so on. 

But any State-sanctioned cryptocurrency wouldn't be Bitcoin or Ethereum, it would be an amalgamation of technologies that provide the unique advantages of neither system. 

Bitcoin transactions cannot, in any useful sense, be forged. This is highly useful in a distributed, zero trust system, but thanks to the Selective Service, isn't really a big problem with the US Dollar anyway. The US economy is enormous, and scaling Bitcoin or some other distributed trust system to handle that volume is tremendously difficult. But that problem was long ago solved by currency solutions. My Visa card works everywhere, world wide, in seconds, effortlessly. 

So, what then, is really the role that cryptocurrency can take in the global economy? At the moment, Bitcoin isn't really a currency so much as a commodity. The vast majority of trades that occur are done by trading bots - an activity I am researching myself. 

With Bitcoin, I'd argue that what is really happening is that we are seeing the emergence of a new type of commodity: the abstract reserve commodity. It's a way of storing vast amounts of wealth, keeping many of the advantages of currency without requiring you to buy [empty condos in New York or London](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150421/REAL_ESTATE/150429973/manhattan-apartments-top-gold-as-instrument-for-storing-wealth-says-blackrock-chairman).

Stop celebrating Pizza Day,"I'm not going to say that it's reasonable to blame Pizza Day for the small dip today, but it did get me thinking about Pizza Day comes off to the broader world, and I don't think that it projects the right image for Bitcoin.

To people in the Bitcoin community, Pizza Day seems like a fun reminder of how far we've come, a celebration of real-world bitcoin use, a proud moment in history.

To people outside the Bitcoin community, however, I think it evokes something negative. It reminds everyone of how volatile it is. The numbers ('millions of dollars for a pizza??') are too absurd for someone without comfort in the crypto space to parse. It makes Bitcoin seem scary/risky to spend, and vaguely scam-like to buy.

I'm a believer in Bitcoin (just bought a bit on the dip today!), and I get why Pizza Day feels like it should be ""a thing"" for us/the world. But to the public, the core of the pizza story is risk, folly, and absurdity.

If Coinbase (or ANY exchange) is allowed to become a bank, ***and*** Bitcoin is finally treated like money, then Coinbase can LITERALLY print Bitcoin.

They simply have to make a note in their computer ""From Jim, to Sally, 1BTC 11:23:36amEST""

hashrate of SOME people ...,"was curios about something. need a little help with calculations. take a look at this address :
1C1mCxRukix1KfegAY5zQQJV7samAciZpv

a miner, apparently, mining around 40 blocks a day. assuming a block being submitted every 10 minutes, there would be around 144 blocks a day. thats about 1/3rd of total blocks !! that need a huge hashrate ! what kind of hashrate should one produce to be able to mine this much ?

i dont even think enough antminer S9s have been manufactured for this hashrate ! 

this is one of such addresses, not belonging to any pool or something. this leads to extremely uneven distribution of the currency and wealth, leading to the very same thing bitcoin was made to fight ; Capitalism, and centralization

this seems to be a very serious issue, that nobody seems to heed. either this, or i'm missing something.

"Your Hardware Wallet (Ledger, Trezor, Whatever) is not important.","I don't think this gets posted enough, so I will post again:

Your Ledger Hardware Wallet is not important.

The paper with your seed is. Your money is there, not on your Ledger, or Trezor, or any other wallet. The chance that someone finds/steals your Ledger and guesses your PIN on the first two tries is almost null.

But if someone finds your recovery seed, they have it all, so PROTECT it accordingly.

What I do is: I use a bip-39 passphrase on top of my 24 words, and I NEVER write down this passphrase. What this does is it creates two wallets - one on the 24 word seed, and another on the 24+1 word seed. You keep a small amount on the 24word seed, and the main amount hidden by the passphrase.

Then you laminate your keys, store it somewhere safely, make a copy and store it with your parents and in-laws.

If you want to write on titanium or whatever, do it. But use the passphrase as well, and NEVER write it down.

As you will never write it down, don't make it dificult or you risk forgetting characters.

With this setup, you end up having a hidden wallet, a plain-sight available wallet that acts as an alarm (if money moves there, it means your seed has been compromised). People will never know that you have a hidden wallet unless you tell them.

More info on how to do it on a Ledger, I guess someone can post how to do it on other hardware wallets too: https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000783134-How-to-set-up-and-or-recover-a-hidden-passphrase-and-alternate-PIN-on-your-Ledger-Nano-S-

P.S.: Of course they are important to do transactions. Way more secure than almost all other setups. Just not as important as your seed.

"120 Million Dollars Per Day Flowing Into Bitcoin , 250 Million for all Crypto","Local Bitcoins volume has quadrupled since this time last year.  It is presently at about 400 million per month worldwide or about 12-13 million per day.  LocalBitcoins purchases should be looked at as especially bullish for the price of Bitcoin because of the premium that buyers are willing to pay to be able to get ahold of BTC.  It means that they are almost exclusively hodler's or users of Bitcoin and that type of capital has the lowest turnover. Low turnover matters because every single day about 90 percent of the money coming from local bitcoins is new money that is adding to the demand for coin and is unlikely to sell for a long time.  That eventually eats away at supply slowly but surely.

Coinbase is the retail level of bitcoin purchasing.  During December of last year Coinbase had 400 million dollars in trading revenue.  So if you put their average fee at about 2 percent of a trade, means about 20 billion dollars in btc. was traded in that one month alone.  Since December Coinbase has increased the number of support people by 500 people.  The number of new users to the site is approaching 30 million.  Which is about 66 percent higher than in December.  The ratio of buyers to sellers on Coinbase is 80/20 and the average purchase of a buyer is $428 dollars.  What matters to the bull case of bitcoin are people that are buying Bitcoin as an investment and who are instantly trading it when the price moves up.  If GDAX does 300 million in volume per day and that includes Coinbase volume in that number, than it's fair to say that about 50 million per day is being added to long term positions per day.

The exchanges have a lot of new customers around the world.  Combined they are doing about 5 billion per day in volume on btc. in total.  What percentage of that are new buyers that aren't trading?  If that number is 1 percent which I think it's reasonable that's another 50 million per day of investment level longs that are happening.

Bitcoin ATMS are confirmed at 3 million dollars per day new money with 90 percent one way invested.  Over 3k ATMS now.

The Square cash app just added Bitcoin trading last quarter and that number adds up to about 300k per day and it's only available so far in 5-6 states.  

Robinhood had a waiting list with over 1 million people on it to be able to trade crypto.   They have 4 million registered users.

There was recently an article that said that OTC demand was coming in at about 100 million dollars per day for large traders.  If all OTC demand is taken into consideration it's probably closer to 200 million.  I'm including trades between friends, family, and other trusted people.  I think that at least 5 percent of that trading would be net long.  So that's at least another 10 million per day.  

Bitcoin.org wallets are growing at about 15k new wallets per day and about 26 million overall.  

Circle says that it's doing about 2 billion a month in crypto volume.

In a growing market the law of large numbers starts to work in bulls favor.  Because if it's true for instance that 5 percent buy with intention to hold for x number of years regardless of price the total number of those types of trades increases as the size of the addressable market grows.  So traders have to trade above a floor that keeps moving up.

Bears lose when the price decreases because even though new user interest is lower during price lulls the total growth doesn't go away and the amount of coin that buyers can get for every dollar of fiat increases.  In a increasing market FOMO kicks in and user registrations sky rocket because of all of the media attention that the price increase generates.  

Bears, sellers, and short-sellers are making the new money the ""smart money"" by giving them a deal that is almost certain.

Think about it differently.  Let's say all of a sudden by magic there were 1 billion owners of a bitcoin.  It doesn't matter if they are all about to sell it.  What matters is that 16-17 million bitcoins has to be divided among a group of 1 billion people.  How much can each of them really own at this exact same price.  About 160 dollars worth.  But that number doesn't jibe if you have people like the Winklevosses that own 1 percent of all bitcoin.  It also doesn't work if the average first purchase of a bitcoin buyer is over 400 dollars.  

Before the market cap can reflect the instrinic value of Bitcoin the market growth has to stop.  New money has to stop being added to the market.  It may be true that based on transaction volume alone that bitcoin ""should"" be worth 10k or whatever number.  But there is way more to the use case for Bitcoin than just that one purpose.  

Gold has pretty limited uses as well but it's worth 7 trillion dollars because of the size of the market and not necessarily its usefulness.

Bitcoin will reach that same ""irrational"" result as long as new people can pouring money into the system.  Bitcoin at 5-10 trillion is not just likely it's mathematically inevitable at this rate of growth.

"Don't cry about bitcoins price, develop something! here is my project: Blockhash.WIN","I'm in the last year of a software engineering study. I followed the open innovation minor the study provides, where I can basically choose any subject that I want to learn about, and make something :). For me that subject was blockchain, being in bitcoin for almost 5 years triggered my interest to really learn about the tech behind it.

When I started with the minor I was a little clueless about what exactly blockchain was good for, hearing mixed things about it online for so long. On one side blockhain promises huge potential for all sorts of usecases but when I started looking in to it I realized that there really aren't that many legit usecases and that money and bitcoin is what the discussion should really be about. BITCOIN IS THE KILLER APP.

Teachers weren't very exited about my findings in the first place and kept pushing that there must be a lot of other things blockchain is good for, it took me a while to gather the right arguments to convince them that they shouldn't be looking a blockchain but instead focus a bit more(if not completely) on bitcoin. Anyway, one idea that stood out and that fitted limited time that I had in the minor was a gambling site, using the block hash as a random source. Not a new concept but I figured it would be a good one to learn about the tech. So I created https://www.blockhash.win/ where players can earn 2x their bet amount by guessing the right last digit of the blockhash that includes their transaction. I've spend many hours developing and I've learned a lot. I would recommend any software engineer or student like me to learn about the tech and build somthing. I learned a lot from the book that I picked up for this minor: Mastering bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (I would really recommend the book if your a software guy or just technical!)

Bitcoin Cash, scaling to the future!

https://www.yours.org/content/bitcoin-cash--scaling-to-the-future--19ff35ba5c94 https://t.co/2HYwkhK9iy

",1527108279,23/05/2018 20:44:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lmrx8/bitcoin_btc_upcoming_events_and_last_14_days/,1
Can't sweep BTC to electrum or any other wallet,"The problem I'm facing is as follows;

I had a lot of money in paysafecard, which I turned into bitcoins on [virwox.com](https://virwox.com). From that website I sent 0.0032 btc to a newly generated address on Bitcoin core \- [3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk](https://blockchain.info/address/3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk). \([https://blockchain.info/address/3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk](https://blockchain.info/address/3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk)\). 

Now, what I didn't notice before sending to Bitcoin Core was the long syncing time, and I didn't have any space on my harddrive to download all the shit. Therefore, I went into the Bitcoin Core console:

\- dumpprivkey [3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk](https://blockchain.info/address/3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk) \(didn't encrypt the wallet so I could type that command straight\)

\- got the private key

\- tried to sweep it into electrum

\- got error ""No inputs found. Note that inputs need to be confirmed"".

The private key was "" Private Key WIF Compressed 52 characters base58, starts with a 'K' or 'L'"", so I tried to convert it to an uncompressed WIF key, starting with 5K via [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org). 

When I tried to sweep the btc to electrum with the new, uncompressed address, I got the same input error. Now, what's wierd is that when I check the address it does indeed have 0.0027 bitcoins on it. I double checked the privatekey many times through the Bitcoin Core console, and it's correct. 

NOW, the issue I'm facing is that I uninstalled the Bitcoin Core client by mistake, and lost the address containing the bitcoins on the client. I do, however, still have the privatekey. Therefore, finishing Bitcoin Core syncing isn't an option.

Also, when I enter the privatekey into a wallet and get the address which it belongs to, I don't get the the same address that shows in bitcoin core \- [3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk](https://blockchain.info/address/3J2tCijTKQLd6jtf3nk8QTtLa73xkVhgfk). 

VIDEO showing the issue here: [https://i.gyazo.com/040dc198efe8ff43d53b41d8a9a3cb9e.mp4](https://i.gyazo.com/040dc198efe8ff43d53b41d8a9a3cb9e.mp4)

When in Bitcoin Core, I generated a new address \- 3CtkTu3Um53F2xriKGZn6wLcAHUuCoZQKD, got the privkey from the console, entered it into a wallet, and when the address corresponding to the privkey came up, it was a different one from the starting  3CtkTu3Um53F2xriKGZn6wLcAHUuCoZQKD. The new address was                1PNVUnBPv4E23Eh8MKTnoNbBV7qCkka9x4.

I suspect this is the same issue that I had with the original address. 

Any suggestions as to what I can do in order to retrieve my bitcoins to electrum or any other wallet for that matter?",1527108335,23/05/2018 20:45:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lms7g/cant_sweep_btc_to_electrum_or_any_other_wallet/,1

"Again, Bitcoin described as a Bubble."," Still a lot of discussions about the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies surrounding in scientific community. Aren't experts yet convainced that bitcoin is a reality?   
In an interview for CNBC, [Robert Shiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Shiller) the professor at Yale University expressed his rather negative sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, saying:  


**Quote**

''To me it’s another example of faddish human behavior.''

Shiller consolidated his opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a long post from where i prefered to take this note:  


**Quote**

''Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, \[…\] None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.''

Connecting Lightweight Wallet to bitcoin node and other Node ???,"I have been involved in bitcoin since about late 2016. I am not a tech or software guy but I have read a lot and researched a lot in that time and feel like I have a solid understanding of what bitcoin is and why I think its important. I learned that it is important for the health of the network for you to run your own node and I have wanted to for a while. 

So I downloaded, installed and am currently running the bitcoin core zip file I got from here: [https://bitcoin.org/en/download](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)  and am excited to finally start running my own node and support the network. 

However I did not know that, from what I have been told, the most secure way you can verify transactions with a lightweight wallet on your phone is if you route it through your own node. In doing so, way you don't have to trust another node in the network to verify the transactions on your phone are correct. Unfortunately I am not familiar with how to do this.

Can anyone please help me with links or instructions on how to link my phone wallet to my node? I am under the impression that the wallet has to be compatible with the node software, if so does anyone have a list of wallets that will work with the bitcoin core node that I am running?

How do you financially secure your family in the event of your own sudden death while owning crypto?,"This thing has been bugging me. I'm not trying to be morbid, but...  How can a person make sure that crypto will go to his immediate family? Sudden death (or stroke that can cause you to loose ability to speak/remember)  happens to some % of population, it is the reality. This sub recommends not sharing your access to crypto with anyone (sometimes not even your spouse).  I think sharing the access with at least one person is a must. But what if you don't completely trust your partner/family with money? That's the situation where banks offer much more reliable and safe solutions - your money will be redistributed after your death just as you decide in a will, with no need to share your wealth with family that you don't fully trust. Again, not trying to be morbid, but those situations happen and they need to be adressed. Statistically everyday (just a hypothetical guess, I have no idea what real numbers are) a bitcoin user dies suddenly, many % of them did not share their bitcoin access with anyone so their money is lost forever. That can really make it 1000x much harder for their families to recover, especially if the person was family's primary moneymaker. What is your take on that?

Is BTC trading price connected to mining cost?,"Hi everyone,

I am curious about the connection between BTC trading price and the cost of mining. A couple of starting questions would be...

1. I've read that mining 1 BTC currently costs around 6000 USD. How does the distance of the trading price from the mining cost effect the network? If the price gets closer to the cost then I assume that there is less incentive to mine? Does this then reduce mining difficulty, reducing the cost so that the ""distance"" remains at a relatively constant factor?

2. I've read arguments that as mining costs increase this causes the trading price to increase, but I can't see how increasing mining costs would have a positive effect in this direction?

So I guess Question 1 is about how BTC price affects mining costs, and Question 2 is about how mining costs affect BTC price. 

Thanks in advance :) ",1527123102,24/05/2018 00:51:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8loiw6/is_btc_trading_price_connected_to_mining_cost/,1

Settle a debate: Is Bitcoin the most traceable currency to exist in the known history of man?,"I was having a discussion with a friend about the many benefits bitcoin has because of it's public blockchain that results in high traceability. For instance, It can easily show the income and spending habits of a person, which will be used to help them get loans or determine how well they are doing as a member of society. 
Plus another benefit is to help to stop money laundering, and other crimes. Its traceable nature can help to improve tax collection, and over all reveal more about the general economy, and human behavior: both on a grand and on a personal level -  allowing economists, law enforcement, and other keepers of our society to design and enforce laws more effectively.

Anyway, my friend disagrees that bitcoin isn't the most traceable currency. He thinks USD is, despite the fact that cash doesn't have the records of transactions (or even history of moving to a different wallet) like bitcoin does. 

What am I missing here? What might be more traceable then bitcoin? That also seems like a good asset to hold if the goal is to help society progress and become more loyal to our central planners.

If all the clever traders really expect the crypto market to crash...,...can you pls explain the following. (I must say that I can only talk with certainty about the bx.in.th exchange market as this is the one I monitor on a daily basis). Every single time the market turns red huge selling orders appear in the order books. Non of these orders is placed to really sell any coins. Not a single coin of these orders is sold. As soon as the buy orders come close the sell orders are cancelled. I would think that if you are a successful trader with a lot of coins and you expect the crypto market to go to zero the only good choice is to sell all your coins as quick as possible? There is only one scenario that I can think of which would explain such behavior. These big traders accumulate and know that the price in the future will be much higher than it is today. Or do I get all wrong????,1527142752,24/05/2018 06:19:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lqhiy/if_all_the_clever_traders_really_expect_the/,1

I am a soon to be graduate student and I am looking for people who are involved in/with blockchain professionally and/or are blockchain experts.

The reason I am asking is because for my internship, I am doing my thesis on how blockchain could improve the documentation process for a shipping agency I am working for. They work with a lot of manual and paper\-based processes. Since the topic is very new and not much to be found in literature. Therefore I would like to conduct interviews. This could be any preferable way you want, phone/skype/e\-mail etc, whichever method is most suitable for you.

I would be very grateful and appreciate it very much if you could spare the time for me to give your input, it would mean the world to me.

Would it do something meaningful for security and be preventive for counterfeit passports?

How about birth certificates? Would it be beneficial to report every new world citizen on a blockchain?
Maybe even the birth certificate and passport blockchains should be connected real early on, preferably to ease peoples life when requesting passports for traveling.

Just thoughts. I'm not a technical. Maybe someone are working on it already, or something similar?

Bitcoin is falling. What to do?,"Bitcoin still broke through the resistance level and jostled below 8,000. How to behave? As always in such situations: shove emotions in the ass \(deep\) and judge soberly.

We answer the questions:

\- Is there a fundamental reason for a strong fall?

No. Not a single tangible strike on bitcoin was not enough, just look into the news. The rate falls, but not because of objective external causes, the fall is speculative \- the market is replaced by weak hands. In addition, in late spring and many traders are recording profit, which affects the market.

 \- Are there any prospects?

Yes, I said about them more than once: institutional investors and the solution of regulatory issues are already closed.

In the end: if your goals are long\-term, then such moments as now, you need to catch. Buy better in stages \- part of the purchase now, and part of the strong resistance level 7000\-7200.

It's not the one who saddles the wave on the trend \(then everyone would be millionaires\), but the one who does not panic and buys at the bottoms. Therefore, there are so few people who are really rich \- they are patient, weighed, and take unpopular decisions without looking at the mood of the crowd. The mood of the crowd now is to come out. The mood turned \- to buy. Decide on whose side you are.",1527153069,24/05/2018 09:11:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lr8ia/bitcoin_is_falling_what_to_do/,1

[Profitability](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#log&amp;1y)

[Global hash rate](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=1year)

At a first glance, this makes no sense, especialy at about 6000 $ brake even BTC price,  but i have a feeling, that the miners are investing a huge amount of money into the future, where new ATH's are expected, in this year and beyond.

What do you think?",1527153903,24/05/2018 09:25:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lranb/btc_gliobal_hash_rate_up_profitability_down_a/,1

Histoy Of Bitcoins,"On 18 August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. In November that year, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer\-to\-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open source code and released it in January 2009 on Source Forge. The identity of Nakamoto remains unknown.

In January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first ever block on the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in the coin base of this block was the following text:

The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.

This note has been interpreted as both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractional\-reserve banking.

The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypher punk Hal Finney, who created the first reusable proof\-of\-work system \(RPOW\) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released, and received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto. Other early cypher punk supporters were Wei Dai, creator of bitcoin predecessor b\-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bitcoin predecessor bit gold.

In the early days, Nakamoto is estimated to have mined 1 million bitcoins.In 2010, Nakamoto handed the network alert key and control of the Bitcoin Core code repository over to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Nakamoto subsequently disappeared from any involvement in bitcoin. Andresen stated he then sought to decentralize control, saying: ""As soon as Satoshi stepped back and threw the project onto my shoulders, one of the first things I did was try to decentralize that. So, if I get hit by a bus, it would be clear that the project would go on. "" This left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin.",1527158884,24/05/2018 10:48:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lroei/histoy_of_bitcoins/,1

Since the beginning of 2017 I've been giving people bitcoin.,"Especially family that I want to get involved in crypto.  I will show them how to setup a wallet. And send them around $50 to $100 dollars worth of bitcoin. I'll backup their keys and explain the importance and make them promise me to not spend it for 5 years. I encourage them to add more over time. 

Now every member of my extended family owns a bit of bitcoin. It has cost a lot. Some of them ignored it, but I didn't. A few of them own mining caves now. 

I would like to encourage you to do the same for those you love or would like to get involved.  At today's price I would encourage you to put at least  1% of a bitcoin away for them.  

Hav3 a great day and please know today is a great day to buy. Also, show them how to mine  .

The price doesn't change the product.,"Just wanted to drop a reminder. If Bitcoin is $19,000 or $19, the product doesn't change one bit.

If you're worried about the price, you probably intend to sell it back into fiat. You absolutely should be nervous, as you care about the value in terms of the money BTC was meant to compete against.

If you bought it because it was a useful technology, interesting, and you like the scarcity principle, congrats! Your percentage of ownership of network tokens has not changed.

That is all.",1527174091,24/05/2018 15:01:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ltb6c/the_price_doesnt_change_the_product/,1

"Latest on Freewallet scam. FAKE hashes, exchange SHUT DOWN","So now, [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) decides to give me a **FAKE hash** on my withdrawal so it appears stuck and cannot be removed. A developer checked into the hash, and told me it **does not exist** and will never transact. He said all Freewallet has to do is rescan their wallets and the balance would reappear so I could make a new transaction. He said this sounds like an intentional tact by them, and obviously it is. They are apparently willing to further damage their name and endure serious problems.

Now that Ive been able to get a developer on my side, AND get Shapeshift on my side, Freewallet has stopped responding to my messages.

I then see, just like any EXIT SCAM will always tend to do, **their services have been shut down as of today.** No exchanging of coins is possible, with no date of resumption given. Classic first step of an exit scam.

[**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) thinks theyre going to steal my holdings, but they'll have a very different result coming entirely.

The Hong Kong Dept of Justice told me they do NOT have any people at the address they list. **It is a FAKE address**

Isn't this US investigation into manipulation very positive for Bitcoin?,"If you think about it, most who are currently manipulating will cease doing so for the time being while this investigation is ongoing. While they obviously can't detect everything, you'd think this would scare off at least a solid amount of the bad apples. While many don't want it, this needs to happen and is a step in the right direction. If Bitcoin is going to be taken seriously and reach the levels you're all HODL'ing for, then let's be real and embrace the changes that will actually get us there.

Question regarding Mining Reward,"Can someone explain why the mining reward often times exceeds the theoretical limit of 12.5 bitcoin at the time of writing?

Why can miners write themselfs bigger rewards as seen in the example below (13 bitcoin) and why does this not make the network reject the block?
If a miner would overdo it and try to issue himself 100 btc the operating full nodes would obviously reject the block. So what is the real limit?

The time to donate all the profits from my crypto apparel site is nigh. Whither shall they go?,"One thing right off the bat, it's a paltry, laughable donation when you compare it to what /u/PineappleFund generously did with that money. 

But, since building crypto apparel site [CryptoCrow.co](https://cryptocrow.co/) as an experiment over two weeks, I got some sales! (a large percentage came from people in /r/bitcoin). As of one month in, I have around $1,000 to donate in fiat and bitcoin to charitable causes. 

Since it's on the smaller side of a donation I'd ideally like it to go somewhere where it can have a meaningful impact. Maybe it's a teacher who needs help with supplies. Maybe it's a local community group, maybe it's something else. 

The site will still be slangin' crypto apparel for a few more weeks so hopefully we'll have more than $1,000 to give away, but even if not, please hit me up if you have a good idea! Doesn't necessarily have to be bitcoin related. Thanks!

BITMAIN ANTMINER S9 13.5TH,"Profit per month:

Disclosure: Mining metrics are calculated based on a network hash rate of 13,823,824,128 GH/s and using a BTC - USD exchange rate of 1 BTC = $ 16838.21. These figures vary based on the total network hash rate and on the BTC to USD conversion rate. Block reward is fixed at 12.5 BTC and future block reward reductions are not taken into account. The average block time used in the calculation is 600 seconds. The electricity price used in generating these metrics is $ 0.132 per kWh.

Antminer S9 Specs:

https://shop.bitmain.com/antminer_s9_asic_bitcoin_miner.htm?flag=specifications

CryptoCompare shows a $790.46 USD profit per month with the following input:

1 BTC = $ 16838.21

Hasting power: 14

Power consumption (w): 1372

Cost per KW/h ($): 0.132

$790 USD/month is the total mined - total cost.

$790 is very profitable. Mining 0.05 BTC/month is very good when the current BTC price is $16k.

Want to buy PC or mining rig with crypto?,"**Hello all crypto currency enthusiasts and computer users!**

We have begun a new business project, for which we have been prepraing ourselves for many years and gained some great experience by that in the IT field and marketing. Our experience has been with an e\-shop which sells IT services as well as computer systems for more than three years.

What can we offer?

Only the best quality products and their set\-ups. But \- mainly we are being focused on the crypto currency. We will accept not only the top 3 crypto currencies – we will accept other currencies, a little less known ones, too.

Willing to pay more then double for the earliest bitcoins minted/used with little to no transaction history.,"I want to get the earliest possible bitcoins with the smallest amount of transaction history as possible. I know most will be owned by Satoshi and Hal, but I am sure there's a few others that haven't moved that are available.
Ideally I want coins that are before 1 million btc were generated.
I would prefer them sent from the address where they originated (block reward) sent to my address.

If they've been moved once or twice, and extremely early on, I may also be interested in it, but I'll have to examine the transaction history.

"I'm confused, isn't it good that bitcoin is public?","I made a post recently that seems to be getting a lot of down votes:https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lp7ch/settle_a_debate_is_bitcoin_the_most_traceable/ 

People are claiming that I am being a shill towards a privacy coin (I didn't even mention anything about it) and that I am just saying all of the negative things about bitcoin in a positive light, like this comment accused me of doing: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lp7ch/settle_a_debate_is_bitcoin_the_most_traceable/dzhrh7k/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Bitcoin

But clearly, other people like tim draper, who is a pretty early adopter and huge supporter of bitcoin (and a true hodler) agrees with me: https://bitrazzi.com/tim-draper-believes-blockchain-to-be-the-catalyst-to-good-governance/

That article basically says everything I was saying, but it got upvoted a ton. 


Privacy is only needed if your goverment is corrupt, but if they are using a public blockchain where we can see all of their actions, they can't afford to be corrupt. Public transactions, for both government and citizens, where everyone can see everyone (not just the elites!) make for a better society. We get to know how the government is really spending our money, and it improves their ability to enforce laws, collect the proper amount of taxes, and it just makes our whole society to get along much better.
Anything that facilitates lying, cheating and stealing is bad, but traceable, public ledgers that no one controls and is apolitical, and just shows the truth doesn't support that, it's like nearly the most virtuous thing to ever exist.

Some technical questions about SegWit,"So segwit has the benefit of very old transaction's signatures  being able to be pruned. Since they are buried under enough proof of work, one can believe that the signature existed and was valid at the time.     
    
&amp;nbsp;

Let's imagine 10 years in the future I spin up a brand new full node. My client downloads &amp; validates all blocks until it finds this 1 segwit tx that it can't find a signature for. Would my node mark it as invalid? What if that TXO was spent a year later, would all child tx's be invalid as well?    
    
&amp;nbsp;
    
What if it was unspent and my node sees someone try to spend the TXO that it hasn't seen the witness to yet in a new block?
  
&amp;nbsp;    

I understand its very unlikely that NOBODY would still have an old segwit tx witness. The idea is that segwit tx's are validated at runtime/when a block is found/propagated and validated, and somewhere down the road I assume very old witnesses may be pruned by full nodes since they were already validated and are buried under a huge amount of Proof of Work or are spent or whatever",1527198072,24/05/2018 21:41:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lwfry/some_technical_questions_about_segwit/,1

Hut 8 Mining Corp. Announces First Quarter 2018 Financial Results,"Hut 8 Mining Corp. Announces First Quarter 2018 Financial Results

All Figures in Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Noted

Company raised $70.0 million to fund investment in mining hardware Entered into definitive agreement with the City of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy First quarter 2018 revenue of $10,988,949 Strong gross profit margin of 80%, or $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) Adjusted EBITDA of $7,690,365 828 Bitcoin mined in Q1

TORONTO, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hut 8 Mining Corp. (TSX-V:HUT) (“Hut 8”, or the “Company”), a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the world’s leading full-service blockchain technology company, the Bitfury Group, is pleased to announce its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (“Q1 2018”). Hut 8 owns Bitcoin mining datacenters called BlockBoxes that are purchased from the Bitfury Group.

Corporate Update

Andrew Kiguel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8, said: “We are pleased with the progress Hut 8 has made in a very short period of time. Hut 8 began mining on December 22, 2017 with 7 BlockBoxes in Drumheller, Alberta, with power capacity of 7.7 MW, representing 52.5 PH/s. On February 7, 2018, an additional 10 BlockBoxes were added in Drumheller for an aggregate power capacity of 18.7 MW, representing 128 PH/s. Despite the ramp-up period, in Q1 2018 Hut 8 was able to mine a total of 828 Bitcoin. As of May 24, 2018, Hut 8 has mined in excess of 1,300 Bitcoin which we continue to hold.”

“We are excited that our data center build-out in the City of Medicine Hat is well underway. We estimate that full-scale production will commence by September 2018. The City of Medicine Hat site will consist of an additional 40 BlockBoxes. Once operational, Hut 8 will own 57 BlockBoxes, representing a 335% increase from current mining capacity, securing our position as one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners in the world, with a total of 66.7 MW of power capacity and 448 PH/s. With this increase in BlockBoxes from 17 to 57, we expect that our daily mining production will increase significantly. We believe our City of Medicine Hat Facility will represent operational excellence and set a new global benchmark for industrial scale cryptocurrency mining operations,” added Kiguel.

Manufactured by the Bitfury Group, the BlockBoxes are regarded as one of the most powerful and cost-effective Bitcoin mining solutions available on the market. The BlockBoxes are based on cutting-edge hardware and software and are fully configurable and upgradeable to the next generation of silicon technology. The efficient design and low operating cost of the BlockBoxes makes Bitcoin mining more productive and affordable. As previously disclosed, Hut 8 has obtained an exclusive right to all Bitfury Group hardware and software solutions, including the BlockBoxes, for cryptocurrency mining within North America.

Q1 2018 Financial Results

Q1 2018 represented Hut 8’s first full quarter in operations. With a gross profit margin of 80% (excluding depreciation), the Company’s mining cost-per-bitcoin was $2,615 (US$2,028), which compares favorably to the selling price of Bitcoin at the end of Q1 2018, being $8,991.67 (US$6,973.53).

The Company believes that Hut 8 is amongst the lowest cost miners of Bitcoin in the world. Hut 8 anticipates its cost per Bitcoin to remain competitive, based on the increasing difficulty rate, offset by the City of Medicine Hat site that will operate more efficiently, next generation BlockBoxes, and a benefit from an improved energy contract for the price of electricity over the Drumheller site.

Selected Financial Highlights from Q1 2018

Revenues of $10,988,949 Gross profit of $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) EBITDA1 of $1,824,685 and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $7,690,365 Completion of the Company’s “Qualifying Transaction” Raised $70.0 million of equity capital to fund investments and growth Cash balance of $23.7 million and working capital of $19.3 million Mined 828 Bitcoin in Q1 2018, bringing total mined since commencing operations on December 21, 2017 to over 1,300 On February 7, 2018, added 10 new operating BlockBox Data Centers for a total of 17 in operation, representing 18.7 MW / 128 PH/s Purchased 40 additional BlockBoxes to be operational by Q3 2018 representing additional 48 MW / 320 PH/s Entered into definitive agreements with the city of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy and the lease of land

Net Loss $ (3,815,784 ) EBITDA $ 1,824,685
Adjusted EBITDA* $ 7,690,365
Loss per share $ (0.05 ) * EBITDA adjusted for fair value re-measurement of digital assets, listing expense and one time transactional costs.

As a result of the decrease in the price of Bitcoin in Q1 2018, Hut 8 incurred a $4.1 million non-cash decrease on the re-measurement of the value of Bitcoin in inventory, and consequently, finished the quarter with a net loss of approximately $3.8 million. In future quarters, when revenue is recorded, the Company would expect to see unrealized gains or losses based on the price of Bitcoin on the corresponding reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined.

In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances contain forward-looking information. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts but instead represent management’s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events.

Forward-looking information is necessarily based on a number of opinions, assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to the factors described in greater detail in the “Risk Factors” section of the Filing Statement relating to the Qualifying Transaction of Oriana Resources Corporation and Hut 8, which is available at www.sedar.com. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Hut 8; however, these factors should be considered carefully.

1 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and consequently, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and loss presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measurement. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding back to net income (loss): interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and impairment charges as further adjusted to add back stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing the Company’s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and impairment charges, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate the Company's operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to establish internal budgets and goals, and evaluate performance of its business units and management, and evaluate potential acquisitions. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the Company's historical and prospective operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and non-recurring items such as goodwill impairments, each of which impact the Company's profitability and operating cash flows, as well as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities.",1527200591,24/05/2018 22:23:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lwqg7/hut_8_mining_corp_announces_first_quarter_2018/,1

Scam customer support number for Bittrex 1-888-225-2549.. I'm like 99.99% sure it is.,"I was having some difficulties with their verification system this morning when I was trying submitting my photos so I called this number after googling a support number for Bittrex. ! +1.888_225_2549 (Bittrex customer service ) "" Since I didnt see a number on the site.. I was hoping to find a business number with support on a google search""

The guy on the other side of phone claims to be from the states "" with an Indian/British accent"" and he was very persistent on trying to allow him to remote access my computer.. I questioned him for about 5 minutes why the f@$ do you need to access my computer if there is a problem with my photo verification process! My photos are already on your server why cant you access them your self?! He never gave a straight answer and at the end it seems the guy was getting kinda inpatient with me and he said my account was going to get removed and banned.. I told him to go f@$ him self and etc..

Later on today.. I had a little flash back about YouTube video I was watching about people falling for a fake virus warning and were prompted to call a number. The YouTube poster called the number was also talking a operator with an Indian accent and wanted remote access to the callers computer..

"" I would never allowed anyone to remote access my computer ever.. but anyone who is not aware of this scam..this needs to be posted ASAP""

""Try it out for your self.. make up some lie about having problems about some photos uploads or something""

Upvote to warn everyone please..

How to set Buy order for XBTUSD contract at higher price,"Scenario:
The current price is 7500 USD, I want to buy 5000 contracts only if the price is 8000 USD. If I place stop limit - I have possibility that all contracts will not get 8000 USD during market swing and some contracts will just remain to fill for 8000 USD. If I place stop market - I have the possibility that some contracts will be bought a way high than 8000 USD. Basically stop orders are not registered in the exchange but waiting to execute. Is there any way I can place buy order for 8000 USD when the market price is 7500 USD and my order is registered in order book. Requesting some light with your experience please.

Bitcoin Adoption/Price Stability Ideas Thread,"I wanted a place where people could post ideas or things that they think would improve adoption of btc.  I also wanted to post some of my ideas as well.  Please feel free to post anything, no matter how crazy, that might contribute to a more robust Bitcoin market.

My Ideas:

1.  I think someone should develop a wallet or feature of a wallet called a bitcoin vault.  The purpose of this would be to lock up coins stored in that wallet for a predetermined period of time.   A vault might have a 10 year timespan.  During that time period people could make contributions to their vault but would be able to avoid the temptation of selling.  At the end of the time the wallet would unlock and work as a normal wallet again.  It would go a long way to providing a high level of security as well because locks could be any length of time in which no one had access to the coins no matter what.  If someone were going on vacation they might put a 2 week lock on their wallet to prevent a home invader from successfully stealing from them or a hacker etc.

2.  An idea I posted in another thread was that there needs to be a larger physical real world network to provide liquidity and for purchasing bitcoin.  One of the ideas that I had was that someone should purchase Coinstar, which is an American company that has machines in 20k locations that convert coins into money and giftcards for a fee.

3.  I would like to see bitcoin boxes created that used a network different from the one that visa uses for its credit card machines.  The idea I had was that instead of paying merchants via ach that a group of payment boxes could be set up around an anchor bitcoin atm.  At the end of a sales day a merchant could take cash from the machine using the receipts that have generated from btc purchases at their registers.

4.  I had an idea that bitcoin giftcards could be created by providing all wallet information under a secure coating.  The final level of activation would require the person to call a phone number and enter a number that was listed on their receipt to get full access to a prepaid bitcoin wallet that existed online.  This could easily be done through a retailer POS system that is able to generate predetermined codes that activate cards when they are scanned.  The activation instead would be done through a phone number.

5.  If we can get a country to abandon its home currency and adopt bitcoin we would be able to legitimately get Bitcoin listed on Forex exchanges.  Even now Forex is possible but since its not an official currency of a country it is more difficult.  A small country would be wise to purchase a large quantity of btc and then make the transition.  They would then have authority to print bitcoin paper currency that was convertible on demand into Bitcoin just as it was in past times with the gold standard.

Mining pool structure,"Appreciate educating me: I understand that a pull is equipped with many ASICs which calculate hashes. When a suitable nonce has been found \(the block solved\), that block is submitted to the distributed ledger through a full node \(FN\) by means of rpc call, right? My question: How many FNs  can be used for this happy event in a single pull? It seems that single FN might be enough. But nothing prevents from having several. In the latter case should they all have different IPs? Of course, I have in mind real, most successful pulls like [BTC.com](https://BTC.com) or BTC.top.

Curious about criminals using bitcoin to hide their tracks and get away.,"There was a local kidnapping case recently where the ransom as being asked in bitcoin. Fortunately the kid was found, but only after some of the ransom was paid.

[Link to article.](https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Life/13-year-old-bitcoin-kidnapping-victim-has-been-found-20180524)

My question is this: Given that the wallet that the bitcoin had to be transferred into is know, thanks to the media getting the [ransom note](https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7432/f4af9b0addcf4171b6377fec1a8093f5.jpeg), can you ""follow the money"" and track down the culprits?",1527246322,25/05/2018 11:05:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m0vxt/curious_about_criminals_using_bitcoin_to_hide/,1
Advantages of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is the only payment method that is 100% irreversible and cannot be charged back. For this reason you should be careful when sending Bitcoins; be sure that you are sending them to a trusted vendor.

Anyone, from any country, of any age can accept Bitcoins within minutes. There is no ID card, passport or proof of address that all conventional banks required to open an account. All you need to do to start sending and receiving Bitcoins is to download a Bitcoin Wallet program and generate a Bitcoin Address.

When making a Bitcoin transfer the fees are extremely low compared to conventional methods of moving money.

Crypto entrepreneur - Seeking advice,"
Hey All,

I need people's advice here.

Long story short I made good money last year in cryptos however this year has been horrible.

I actually lost 1.2k USD on a short position.

I am not in any finanacial troubles and I could actually go on for atleast 2 years without making any profits ! But it sucks knowing that this year I made nada !

This was ofcourse due to my trading mistakes but I have learned alot in very expensive lessons!

I am a passionate crypto enthusiast ! Day in day out this is what I am geeking out about !

Does anyone have any advice on how to make more money in the crypto space?

Things that I have been trying.

@ I have been applying for online crypto remote jobs at the moment.

@ I thought of forming my own Crypto consultancy / service firm where I could get people / business / investors into cryptos by the masses but I do not have the mentality for this or time.

@ I come from a technical systems engineer / admin background where I looked after the networks of corperations and I want to build something great in the crypto space that is related to this but I have no idea what it is !?!?

Any thoughts yall?",1527263473,25/05/2018 15:51:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m2sqf/crypto_entrepreneur_seeking_advice/,1

"what are the best methods to ""cash out"" bit coins.","i only know of two ways. coinbase which can send $ to your bank account. but it takes 3 days which is a really long time.

ive used localbitcoins in conjunction with paypal and zelle(wells fargo). however ive been reading about lbc and it seems like a fairly risky place to trade. even people with great feedback sometimes turn on their clients.

so what gives? i have a number of customers who use bitcoin as their payment method. i need something at least somewhat reliable.

thank you ahead of time.",1527264338,25/05/2018 16:05:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m2wql/what_are_the_best_methods_to_cash_out_bit_coins/,1
"In my spare time, I have created an app that makes accepting payments in Bitcoin much easier: MoonPos","I believe that all of us here want Bitcoin to be a success. To make it happen, I believe that we need to shift the mindset from ""HODLing"" to actually using it, paying with it. And at the same time, more and more business should accept payments in Bitcoin. Bitcoin should be used as a currency. And currencies are means of exchange for goods or services. If I want to use Bitcoin for speculation, I can always buy new BTC from an exchange after spending it, it's easy like that.

I have been thinking about the second part – making it easier for businesses to accept payments in crypto – for some time. At the same time, I found out that some coffee places have problem – it is hard to get into crypto and there is no service that would fit their needs. So next to my job, in the evenings, I have created MoonPos, an Android app which makes accepting payments in Bitcoin quite easy.

www.moonposapp.com

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDHgMwLAk54


The app is completely free and there are no fees or in-app purchases.

For now the app is focused on people, who already have some knowledge about Bitcoin and have their own wallets and addresses. But I'd like to change this in the future. It could also Lightning network as well. MoonPos has a simple and intuitive UI, which makes working with it in a restaurant/coffee shop very easy. The app works on a separate module (library), which can be easily added into an already existing Android Point-of-Sale apps. MoonPos is adjusted both for smartphones and tablets.

You can download it on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moonpos) for free.

For news, follow our [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/MoonPosApp/)

I will be grateful for any feedback, ideas, or sharing this with someone who would like to accept Bitcoin and others in their establishment.",1527264546,25/05/2018 16:09:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m2xp4/in_my_spare_time_i_have_created_an_app_that_makes/,1

"A UK company has trademarked the word ""BITCOIN""","I'll keep this sort. I run a very small t\-shirt business and a few of my shirts contain the word bitcoin. Today I received a cease and desist [letter](https://imgur.com/a/JTBZKui) claiming I'm breaking their trademark for the use of the word ""BITCOIN"", I didn't believe it at first since I knew that bitcoin and the bitcoin logo are public domain, and even a similar trademark application in the US failed. Well turns out a they did manage to get a trademark filled, it can be viewed [here](https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003279106). So basically anyone in the UK that puts the word bitcoin on any type of clothing or even a drink can be sued.

I'm posting this in the hopes someone knows the trademark laws better than me. I believe a trademark invalidation can be filed to get this removed since bitcoin is somewhat a generic term and therefore should be free for everyone to use. If anyone has the know how to file a invalidation please do so \- [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade\-marks\-invalidation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade-marks-invalidation) ",1527266259,25/05/2018 16:37:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m35ox/a_uk_company_has_trademarked_the_word_bitcoin/,1

At 9.30am i placed the buy order with a wrong Swift code. My failure.. (Swift instant instead of swift, i didn't know the difference). After work at 6.30 pm i noticed it. 

Direct after i created a new buy order with the correct settings, 15 min later i had a new seller. 
5 min after accepting the trade, Bisq opened a transaction on blockchain. Both of us had to send security deposit, which was confirmed in minutes. 
Then i had to send the Fiat to the private account of my trade partner.
Nearly 20h later i recieved my bitcoins! 

I payed 1% under the mean value of BTC of yesterday

"Showerthought: realistically, no would care about ""hodling"" if the Bitcoin price suddenly skyrocketed upwards. They want their Lambo/mansion/flamethrower asap. People just tell themselves to hodl because they don't want to sell at a loss.","It's not really about the technology maaaaan. It's actually about waiting until more suckers throw their money into the pile so you can make a buck.

Some people say that they simply ""believe in Bitcoin"", which kinda sounds like when people say they ""believe in Jesus"" or some other religious figure. I think this is simply to mask that they are upset about their losses and want to find some sort of redemption in that they are ""contributing"" to some higher project, ie blockchain or Bitcoin.

People are hodling in order to wait for the price can get back to a point where they are in the green so they can decide their next move (whether that means buying a cool toy, house, car, etc.)

Any recommended or user experiences with a bitcoin/crypto debit card?,"I know of the Shift card, but I don't do much with Coinbase. I have very little in crypto, but it would still be neat to have such a card, if for nothing more than the novelty of having it.

I searched around and see a bunch of cards...confusion. I wondered if anyone might share his or her experiences or thoughts, good or bad. 

I suppose what I'm looking for is a card that can be loaded with crypto, then used where credit card places are accepted. I realize this is not the end game use case...to use a crypto card as a debit card...but it is definitely a current use case. Naked fact: crypto is not accepted is most places. 

As a side note, my experience with Coinbase has been great and I respect what they do, especially for getting new folks in the game.

We run a Cryptocurrency Exchange and we outright refuse to put Bcash on our exchange (although we have had requests to do so). Bitcoin was designed to be an open democratic protocol to serve everyone and the oligarchy Roger Ver and his followers adhere to goes against everything Bitcoin is about.,"It amazes us how many exchanges are listing an outright scam like RogerVerCoin \(Bcash\) and are still receiving business from the community.

It seems most exchanges don't have any moral backbone, no stance for what's right or wrong.  All they want is to get paid and sucker in as many customers as possible, regardless of the outcomes.

The list of exchanges accepting Bcash is astonishing:

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin\-cash/#markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets)

We would paste the list here but it is too long \(you can check yourself\).  Over 200 exchanges accepting Bcash!

Bitcoin is about the community, about a global consensus, people sharing fairly and taking control of the money supply away from the money oligarchs. 

We run the exchange [https://digitalfinex.com](https://digitalfinex.com) and we've had requests to put Bcash on our exchange but we will never do so!

People could vote with their wallets and stop using those exchanges, but because some of those exchanges are so massive the people have no choice.

At DigitalFinex we have a stance, we're giving RogerVerCoin \(Bcash\) the middle finger and cutting the bullshit.",1527292579,25/05/2018 23:56:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m6960/we_run_a_cryptocurrency_exchange_and_we_outright/,1

Moved bitcoin to trezor question.,"My non computer savvy friend bought bitcoin years ago on my advice. I helped him put it on a paper wallet. As price went up and on my suggestion he got a trezor. We transferred his Bitcoin on November 16th. Told him to keep the paper wallet until we figured out how to get the Bcash off. (Fake Electrum stuff was going on at the time and I wasn’t familiar enough with it to help with that) Fast forward to last week and I see him and he reminds me we still need to get it the Bcash off the paper wallet and now his trezor supports it. I see the Bcash(bitcoin).com wallet has an import option. I show him how to use it. He texts me this weekend very worried because it’s telling him the Bcash paper wallet has a 0 balance. I was working and by the time I got back to him the crisis was over. He said he has no idea how, but he had been looking everywhere and he looked in his trezor and it was there. I check and the balance was moved on December 29th. He would not have even thought about attempting that on his own. I didn’t do it. Any idea how the Bcash moved to his trezor?

"Question from a Bystander - What does ""Store of Value"" Mean in the Context of Bitcoin?","Disclaimer: I am not the most technologically proficient person and own no bitcoin, but have followed the bitcoin market, and this board, for years.

There seems to be a repeated dialogue of bitcoin as a currency vs. bitcoin as a ""store of value"", that is ""similar to gold"". 

From my understanding, both currency and commodities (including gold) are ""stores of value"", i.e. assets that can be ""saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time"".

Has the community created a false dichotomy? Or is there something that I am missing?

Bitcoin Educators: Why is it important and beneficial to teach about Bitcoin?,"**I'm here to get input, quotes, resources, and feedback from anyone involved in Bitcoin education.**   


I'm an educator in Seoul, Korea, and I also help organize the Seoul Bitcoin meetup with a few others. For a graduate school course I'm taking in Visual Media Technology, I'll be creating a presentation on The Benefits of Teaching Bitcoin. This project will satisfy my course requirements but will also be presented by me at an upcoming Seoul Bitcoin meetup in early July.   


**My presentation will mainly be centered on the following components but will will also include how Bitcoin works by the  nature of these components:**  


**1\)** Teaching about Bitcoin can help learners understand and take interest in:  economics, game theory, information theory, privacy and censorship, ethics, politics, cryptography, coding \(explanation of how it's true and why it's important\)  


**2\)** How to teach about Bitcoin \(what to start with and steps through the process &amp; useful methods/activities/analogies\)  


My goal is to explain how teaching about Bitcoin can be a valuable educational tool. I'd appreciate any of your thoughts, experiences, resources \(links, video, images, Ppts\).  


**Title:** Bitcoin: A Cross\-Curriculum Education Tool

**Format:** PowerPoint Presentation

**Exigency:** Bitcoin is something I have grown to love studying and teaching about. It encompasses aspects of my childhood education that I have always disliked, yet which I now enjoy. I believe Bitcoin can serve as a strong educational tool to motivate and educate young learners, garnering interest in important fields that are often taught with little real world application. Bitcoin can solve those teaching woes because it is shockingly brilliant.

**Audience:** My audience will be learners \(high school and up\) who know little to nothing beyond having heard the word “Bitcoin”, but who are willing to learn about it and open to the possibility that it might be a good for it to be used as an educational tool to possibly incorporate into a classroom curriculum.

**Constraints:** There are perhaps too many aspects of Bitcoin to explain, yet they are all important to the system. Some parts are very technical, and it will be challenging to find a balance between explaining certain things at a surface level and diving deep into the technical details.

Scam customer support number for Bittrex 18336614666. I'm like 99.99% sure it is.,"Scam customer support number for Bittrex 18336614666. I'm like 99.99&amp;#37; sure it is.

I was having some difficulties with their verification system this morning when I was trying submitting my photos so I called this number after googling a support number for Bittrex. ! \+1.888\_293\_6630 \(Bittrex customer service \) "" Since I didnt see a number on the site.. I was hoping to find a business number with support on a google search""

The guy on the other side of phone claims to be from the states "" with an Indian/British accent"" and he was very persistent on trying to allow him to remote access my computer.. I questioned him for about 5 minutes why the f@$ do you need to access my computer if there is a problem with my photo verification process! My photos are already on your server why cant you access them your self?! He never gave a straight answer and at the end it seems the guy was getting kinda inpatient with me and he said my account was going to get removed and banned.. I told him to go f@$ him self and etc..

Later on today.. I had a little flash back about YouTube video I was watching about people falling for a fake virus warning and were prompted to call a number. The YouTube poster called the number was also talking a operator with an Indian accent and wanted remote access to the callers computer..

"" I would never allowed anyone to remote access my computer ever.. but anyone who is not aware of this scam..this needs to be posted ASAP""

""Try it out for your self.. make up some lie about having problems about some photos uploads or something""

Upvote to warn everyone please..

Questions about choosing Wallet,"In the past few months i've been gathering info and am now considering to put some money on BTC and a few other altcoins. My plan is to have some money in crypto for the long run, and perhaps perform just a couple of transactions per year, but NOT to use it as a currency (at least for now).

I have a few questions that are making it hard for me to choose the type of wallet:

1. Mobile VS Desktop: which is safer? I see contradicting arguments: E.g. at [this 99bitcoins page](https://99bitcoins.com/best-bitcoin-wallet-comparison-review/), at 6:52 of the video it says mobile wallets present ""the worse possible scenario for security"", but at [this bitcoin.org page](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet), any choice of Mobile wallet is marked as ""Secure environment"" while any choice of Desktop wallet is marked as ""Vulnerable environment"".
2. Mycelium VS Electrum: which is safer? At [this bitcoin.org page](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/mobile/android/mycelium/) it says Mycelium has centralized validation and if i choose Electrum it shows SPV (better), but the comparison table [at this 99bitcoins page](https://99bitcoins.com/best-bitcoin-wallet-comparison-review/) says Mycelium has higher security than Electrum.
3. Would you find desktop/mobile Electrum to be ""safe enough"" for a larger sum? If not, what wallet would you recommend for my specific purpose?
4. Can i create a hot wallet and later ""move it"" to a cold wallet when it starts having a larger sum? How?
5. Trezor VS Ledger Nano S: which is safer? At [this bitcoin.org page](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/hardware/ledgernanos/), it says the Ledger has only basic transparency while the Trezor has complete transparency, but i've not found that difference in the 99bitcoins site or anywhere else ftm.
6. Do you see any problem in having a larger sum in a paper wallet (other than the concern of taking care of the paper itself)? Do you agree with [this page](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/paper-wallet-guide/) where it claims that paper wallets are even safer than hardware wallets?
7. From the article i linked above, it seems that paper wallets are only meant to receive funds once and also to send out funds once... does it have to be so?
8. In a paper wallet, when i use my private key to send funds is the key and wallet compromised? What should i do to prevent? What app/wallet do you recomend to use in conjunction with a paper wallet?

Any help on these questions would be is much appreciated.

Best BTC/crypto debit card,"Of course everyone is interested in crypto as a speculative asset to make MOON gains and get lambos. I really am invested in crypto because I love the idea of fixed supply currency as well as me being the only one to control my own money. Due to where we are at adoption wise, it is still very difficult to avoid banks completely. However, I have been closing my accounts and transitioning to be completely bank free eventually. I would love if merchants would accept crypto directly and would not need this but for now I am searching for a debit card where I can spend my crypto asset holdings. I would really appreciate some recommendations of the lowest fee debit cards and ideally anonymous as well.

Bread wallet Seed Phrase Error - could possible be effecting a lot of people - Breadwallet support not helping,"I have been using breadwallet since November 2016, when I first got the wallet I wrote down my ELEVEN word seed and I typed it in again to prove I wrote it down before I started using the app.

Recently I opened the breadwallet app and it asked me ""create a new wallet or recover one"". I was shocked since my wallet apparently disappeared but I was not concerned because I had my 11 phrase seed written down.

I go to type it in and it actually my seed is supposed to be 12 words.....

This is an error, I contacted them on twitter via messages and they responded and they sent me a link to this [GitHub ](https://jmacwhyte.github.io/recovery-phrase-recovery/) which appears to be designed to combat this issue. I tried and it didn't  work and I told them this and I still haven't gotten a response and I am out XXX$(I say ""XXX"" because my point isn't the Bitcoin but rather what appears to be a flaw)

Is there an analysis of the amount of Bitcoin transaction amounts under 100 USD per block?,"I have been thinking about the scaling debate lately. I want to have a better understanding of how Lightening Network will improve congestion. In order for me to be better informed I started looking for an analysis described in the title. I could not find one. Perhaps one of you could point me in the right direction or give me a better search criteria? Ideally if the information was able to be split to before blocks became full and after as well. If not perhaps a tool I could use to generate this information or an API I can use to create a tool that would accomplish this task? Perhaps also grouping by transactions from known exchanges as well?

Some of the questions I want to answer are:

How many transactions per block were under 100 USD before blocks were full and after blocks were full?

How many of these transactions per block were under 100 USD sent from exchange wallets?

Although these questions seem relatively intuitive, I think that it is important to quantify this information to get a better understanding of scale. I do understand that conditions now are different than in the past, however, I cannot see into the future, only the past.

Seeing John McAfee Get Put in His Place By This Founder Gave Us Hope For the Future of Cryptocurrency,"As everybody in this group surely knows, John McAfee regularly uses his 840,000+ follower Twitter account to shill for ICOs and just generally throw his weight around. So after hearing that he was earning US$500,000 per tweet promoting ICOs on Twitter, you can imagine how frustrating it would be to see him promote YOUR project even though someone else was taking credit for it. That’s what Tomas Stasiulevicius experienced, and what happened next renewed our faith in cryptocurrency (and humanity in general)…

Altcoins waste a lot of time and resources.,"No currency is useful unless it is liquid. Currencies must have demand in order to be spent and used as a means to transfer value. Thus, every new currency must be a viable investment if it is to be viable as a currency. However, because the value of currencies is explained by the network effect, it is always to be expected that the currency with the biggest network will win.

It is therefore irrational to create altcoins and unethical to promote them. I don't like altcoin because because I do not like watching people get scammed by them. ",1527392409,27/05/2018 03:40:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mfciz/altcoins_waste_a_lot_of_time_and_resources/,1

Under 18 and in the UK,"Hey I'm looking to purchase some bitcoin but it seems impossible to get it if you're 17 and in the UK without verification. I've tried Blockchain.info but my debit card was declined for some reason they won't disclose I'm assuming because the age on the account isn't 18??? Just wondering does anyone have any sure ways I could get ahold of some BTC without a 500% mark up... Or is anyone here interested in selling me some BTC for a 3 - 5% mark up??

Bitstamp seemingly running bitcoin transaction profiling activities without user knowledge,"Hi all, obvious throwaway account, as I don't want Bitstamp figuring out who I am, in case I am one of few people this is happening to.

I've been dealing with their support ever since (foolishly) filling in their KYC questionnaire. I have been a verified user on their site for many years.

A year ago or so, they introduced the KYC procedure to me (I don't know when it was introduced for other users). Recently I filled it in, thinking that would be the end of it.

It was far from the end of it. In the KYC questionnaire I stated that all my Bitcoins come from mining (which they do). I tried to answer all questions truthfully. Now, all of a sudden, Bitstamp is making all sorts of speculative allegations around some Bitcoin coming from mining, some from gambling and various other unknown transactions. Some even to Helix, the former tor-based Bitcoin mixer service, allegedly. I find that very intriguing, as I am reasonably sure I didn't. Particularly not from my passport-verified Bitstamp account. But even if someone did, I wonder why Helix is being singled out? It feels a bit as though they are going after oddly specific addresses or transactions.

As for the 'gambling' it is of course possible that at some point in the past I've moved some Bitcoin from my local wallet to a gambling site and then from there into Bitstamp. But that doesn't change these BTC originally came from mining, making my response truthful regardless. The KYC questionnaire does not include ""please provide the exact route all your Bitcoin took in getting here"".

It is particularly worrying to think that they feel they will just provide me with a few transaction IDs, and that they expect I would somehow know what these random strings of letters and numbers mean, when in the background they have already built a speculative view of what they are.

This makes me think that they cannot rely on their methods and are hoping to fish for confirmations from the users about their transactions.

At no point was I informed that I need to keep my entire transaction history (which I happily would have done, had I known), that they are building a profile of your transactions behind the scenes, without your knowledge (after all, my transaction history is all just IDs, no other information visible. They should really make this stuff transparent to users.) and that they would use this to ask very personal questions about my transaction history.

What if I bought a bunch of sex-toys through Helix, hoping to stay anonymous, and now Bitstamp show up analysing my history going ""oh, look, they sent £5 to this sex shop via Helix, naughty"". Where are they getting this data from? 

Their support simply said it was a ""Blockchain Analysis"".

Lastly, the amounts we are talking about, that I have ever owned or traded are pitiful. That makes this particularly worrying. Why would someone care about such a tiny amount of Bitcoin? Surely if this is all about avoiding money laundering and illegal activities, you would look for places where actually large amount of Bitcoin are being shifted.

I would warn you all to proceed with caution. I have requested all my information be released under GDPR, but I have a feeling they will find a way to worm their way out of that.

""As with any change, we understand you may have concerns about how this requirement impacts you and the consequences of not meeting this verification deadline. Here are further details on what to expect.

On the date of the deadline, legacy accounts will be placed in a state where:

Trading and lending will be disabled;
Open orders will be closed;
Loans will have auto-renew switched off;
Margin positions will be given an 8 week wind-down period where they can only be diminished or closed. After the 8 week wind-down period, they will be closed;
Deposit addresses will be revoked. Any deposits sent to a revoked address will not be recoverable until the account is fully verified;
Withdrawals will remain enabled at the daily withdrawal limits prior to the deadline.
**If at any point you verify your legacy account, full functionality will be restored and your daily withdrawal limit will be increased to $25K USD equivalent.**""

Risk/Reward - Chances of doubling Your Money - Investing 500k with a 5 years time horizon - Real Estate - Gold - BTC or Stocks,"Say someone has $500k to invest and they have a 5 year time horizon. Their goal is to double their money within that time period. They are risk takers and can afford to lose it all.

Real Estate:

They could buy a home or building and maybe it will go up to a million dollars. Considering the fact that real estate right now is already high in the US, the chances are for their investment not to go up much or even decline.

Gold:

Gold would have to go to about $2600 an oz for them to double their money. That is $700 above what Gold ever traded at. 

Stocks: 

Stocks have had a very strong run in the past 7+ years. Seven years ago if you invested 500k in the S&amp;P you would have doubled your money by now. What are the chances of it going from 2700 to 5400, that is $2700 above what it is has ever been in the next 5 years? You can argue you would hand pick the best stocks or ETF's, however, when you have mega hedge funds delivering poor results with their picks, what do you think you will deliver? 

BTC: 

Bitcoin would have to go to about $15,000 for them to double their money. That is about $5000 less than its high. Will there be more business accepting BTC in 5 years from now? Will there be more people trading BTC 5 years from now? Will there be more BTC ATM machines and more solutions to make it easier for people to take part in it?

Future in Focus: ADAMANT Messenger,"With the rapidly developing technologies in the modern world the risk of jeopardizing one’s privacy is growing. When it comes to messaging applications, the users are mostly required to verify their identity, providing huge amounts of personal data, including phone numbers, addresses, photos, which makes them vulnerable to the attacks which are aimed at stealing private information.
This data is stored on servers that can be hacked despite all security measures. And users do not know how their personal data will be used by criminals after being stolen.

Even if your data is not stolen, a lot of messengers can be used for creating a clone of your account, copying photos, naming other things with your name and sending out fraudulent messages that would damage your or your friends' image.

The problem of anonymity can be solved with the help of blockchain technology. There is no doubt in the availability of cryptocurrency for transferring information about transactions. Moreover, blockchain can be used for sending messages as well.

One of the blockchain projects which stand out of the crowd is ADAMANT. The ADAMANT project is made to respond to the question of trust in private data transfer security, since it is based on a proven to be robust Blockchain conception, and its program code is open and public.

As the developers of the project state, ADAMANT has such distinctive security and anonymity features as:

•	All messages are directly stored in the blockchain
•	The is no access to the user’s address book
•	The is no access to the user’s location information
•	No user identifications - a complete anonymity of use
•	All messages are fully encrypted on the sender’s device and then decrypted on the recipient side
•	The client app does never transfer a user’s Private Key or mnemonic phrase over the network
•	No user Private Data is being transferred
•	The message history is never stored on a device and is directly loaded from the blockchain
•	It is impossible to obtain the user’s IP-address
•	The program code for ADAMANT Messenger and blockchain are openly sourced
•	ADAMANT accounts can not be closed, blocked or limited by anyone, including the developers",1527429491,27/05/2018 13:58:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mhwc6/future_in_focus_adamant_messenger/,1

Business Ideas with Smart contracts in mind. (3rd party deposits),"Hello r/Bitcoin

I'd like to post an open\-source idea, one that perhaps you could improve with your own knowledge and experience .

Or if you're an entrepreneur perhaps this idea has value to you. Here goes:

I would like to see a website that offers a 3rd party service to people who want to make safe and automated deposits via smart contracts.

Let's say for example, I'm a landlord and I visit [wehaveacontract.com](https://wehaveacontract.com) \(yes, this url is available\). 

the website, that's user friendly to non law or tech users, will simply state:

""I wish to \[request/deposit\] the amount of \[amount\] with \[person/2nd party\]. Funds will be \[returned to them/ given to me\] by \[mutual approval/ by single party approval / by automatic approval\] on this date  \[date\].

In the above example, upon filling the form the contract is sent to my tenant who will get the message automatically, I am then notified upon payment \(via fiat or crypto\), and once settled they will get their money back via smart contract upon my the condition of my approval.

Problem:

What happens if there is no approval? Let's say my tenant broke our terms of agreement? Well it's a legal matter outside the scope of the service, but it allows for many ways for things to be settled. Overall neither party will get paid until the matter is resolved, which could be done legally.

The real problem:

The market. Customers will want &amp;#37;100 return on their deposit. Can a coin be made for this kind of service? It might be worth while looking into it if you have the resources.

While typing this I have a feeling this idea already exists, if not, then why not? No really, if not then PM me I'd like to invest.

Note: Can you think of more examples? I have one more, I'd invest in a coin and get it to return to me when the market reaches x amount. It's not what the website will offer but it's just the idea of how smart contracts can change things for future businesses.

"Bitcoin, the only coin with a reputation for resiliency. Big deal IMO","Within this entire ecosystem bitcoin is the only crypto to have survived five brutal bear markets (80% declines in value), and bounced back proving its resiliency in the harshest and toughest of times. From reputation attacks, major exchange hacks like Mt Gox, the blockchain bandwagon, silk road, scaling debate, media attacks, I could go on.. 

No other crypto comes close. They have little to no air time in the news, not enough transaction volume to have scaling issues and except for ""charlie lee coin"" ALL of them have only lived through ONE bubble, 2017.. 

If you were required to invest into crypto for no other reason than to hedge, where gains are not the goal but its a play based on hedging against bank industry disruption, which coin in this ecosystem is the only one that has a proven track record of resiliency. BITCOIN!

Bitcoin is the only crypto that has a reputation of staying power. It is the only coin that makes sense from a fiduciary responsibility perspective.

when institutional money comes knocking a large percentage of the money they are required to allocate into crypto will go into bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the safe play in this space. The rest of this ecosystem is equivelant to a speculative venture capital investment into a tech start-up.

Betting On The Blockchain: Secrets of BetMoose.com,"Hello everyone. My name is Malcolm Rose and I write about obscure cryptocurrencies, topical cryptocurrency issues, etc. I recently wrote an article about a gambling website that I'm partial to: BetMoose. This is the first in a series of reviews I'm planning on writing about cryptocurrency gambling/betting sites.

Rather than hosting something like poker or blackjack, this site is more about predicting outcomes. Here you can even ""be the house"" and create your own betting propositions. This site runs entirely through Bitcoin - no other cryptos.

One of the biggest issues with these kinds of gambling sites is ""trust"" - can you trust them with your money? Can you trust that the outcomes of bets will be ""fair""? Well, in the case of BetMoose, my opinion is that they pass with flying colors - read about it now here:

Leaked information from a Coinbase employee,"Throwaway account for privacy.

I had been contemplating for a while whether this was worth it or not, but with current changes at the office, I feel that it's necessary.

I'm a software engineer at Coinbase in San Francisco, California. This puts me in a position to verify a few things that have been floating around out there. The first response I can see coming is, ""Fake. Why would you want to hurt where you work?"". I'm going to be leaving soon anyways. Ask anyone at Coinbase, and they'll tell you people come and go all the time. There are less than a handful of employees there that are not hoppers going from tech company to tech company in SF anyways. It doesn't damage my privacy revealing that I'll be leaving soon.

**INSIDER TRADING**

Yes. Just yes, lol. I know everyone knew this, but I just figured it would be best to come from an actual employee from Coinbase. I'll start by saying that I didn't actually do this myself. I do want to confirm that I knew that Coinbase was going to support Bitcoin Cash 10 days in advance before it went into production. The reason I didn't buy Bitcoin Cash is because I was already starting to get bored with cryptocurrency anyways, and actually I had thought about it, but I didn't think that the price reaction would be as intense as it actually was. This game is tricky and things can go down as sharply as you think they would go up. I just figured it was best I didn't touch it.

I know multiple Coinbase employees personally that engaged in insider trading. For the most part, it seems like they weren't trying to be malicious or anything, they just figured it was free money. I hope this doesn't hurt them \(they're actually a good person\), but for example, I know of somebody who does QA, who was doing testing on the Bitcoin Cash workflow before Bitcoin Cash support went into production at Coinbase, and the first time they had actually heard we were going to support BCH was when they saw strings relating to BCH in the backend. There's a very efficient workflow at Coinbase where testers just get code, and rinse and repeat so they don't really know what's coming to them until they get it. Code is written, code is reviewed, code gets pushed, it triggers testing and builds with CircleCI \(a continuous integration platform\), once it passes tests it gets pushed to next stage. It's all very smooth and an assembly\-line\-like environment.

This QA tester saw that we were going to support BCH and I know personally that they bought some BCH. Not sure of the amount, but we make good money here. They probably made a lot of money from insider trading BCH. This is just one of many. Anybody who thinks employees didn't know about BCH being supported beforehand, are just naive. There is no way we can do our jobs without knowing beforehand. 

**COMPANY CULTURE**

A disaster. To anyone who works at Coinbase, this will be the biggest proof that I do indeed work at Coinbase. They would 100&amp;#37; be able to vouch for this. 

Coinbase is all about image. All of this is going to be generic to any SF\-based tech company, however, it's gotten very extreme at Coinbase. In the past, Coinbase generally had a 'white\-bro programming' culture, and people in the Bay Area were starting to catch on around last year. Because of this, Coinbase has been doing a massive diversity push lately. I know cases of Coinbase having stronger candidates, but choosing the lesser\-qualified candidate because of diversity. I won't get into politics, but I can assure you that Coinbase doesn't care about their customers nor their employees, just company image. Videos on the website, pictures posted by executives/upper\-management on LinkedIn, all try to paint a false picture of ""diversity"" at Coinbase. This is the current change Coinbase is going through and it's become such an obsession with upper\-level management that it's actually causing quite an internal turmoil at Coinbase. 

**CEO**

Brian, our CEO, is your typical white\-bro crypto\-maniac. He's gotten so attracted to the money side of things that come along with cryptocurrency, that he forgets the real mission and the real importance of the success of it. Many people don't know this, but Brian is actually a billionaire from cryptocurrency alone. This is excluding the &amp;#37; stake he holds in the company, and his net worth from the company valuation. He would be a billionaire without Coinbase. He has a LOT of cryptocurrency. Similar to any crypto\-whale, he wants crypto to succeed just because it protects his wealth. Just like Warren Buffet wanting to protect convential dollars to protect personal wealth, Brian wants to protect crypto to protect personal wealth. He doesn't actually care about you guys, in case you didn't know. 

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

I'm not sure if this is helpful at all, but I hope it sheds some light on how Coinbase is a toxic company. There are plenty of alternatives that have everything you've found positive in Coinbase. Whether that be UI, ease\-of\-use, support, there's an alternative that matches Coinbase's. I suggest you move to those. Once Coinbase gets through their current legal trouble with the past insider\-trading scandal, they are going to add support for another currency. They'll try to be ""more careful"". Everyone will get screwed again. Employees get richer. Don't be a pawn for corporate cryptocurrency.",1527457620,27/05/2018 21:47:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ml0jt/leaked_information_from_a_coinbase_employee/,1

SEED storage in bank vault 🏦,"Hi,

I am considering this setup, please let me know your thoughts.

Buying two sets of ColdTi or something similar.
Punching my 24 word seed into them. First 12 on one plate and last 12 on the other plate. So my seed is split into 2 pieces. 

Then I will store the plates in 2 different bank vaults. 

It is a temporary solution. Later I'm thinking of splitting it up in 3 pieces only needing 2 parts to get to funds.

I do have the whole seed stored in another locations as backup.

What's you're way for analysing a new crypto for investment?,"I've been in the crypto game since last June and the community is one of the coolest and funniest thing I have experienced. But all the trolling, especially on the subreddits make it hard to make a conclusion regarding investment. 


I have bougth a book about technical analysis and Andreas atonopolous bitcoin book. I like crypto currency a lot and I own some different coins and I like to expand my portfolio, but I don't have enough knowledge do to big investment. I'm interested in learning how you guys make you're investment decisions. Personally I just read the white paper and roadmap and some research on the internet. And if I like what I'm reading and believe in it, I make a invest. But this is where it gets really difficult for me. I have no knowledge in coding or programming. And most of the white paper looks like Russian or Greek for me.  Everybody and especially the shit kids on YouTube are all ""pro traders with the best tips"". And yeah I forgot to mention that all the new coins are ethereum killers xD. This is why it's hard for me to invest larger amount of money I'm willing to loose. 


EOS is a good example, But how can I find out if it is bs or not? If you have a Twitter account, subreddits, steemit, blog etc plz share them with me. The only way I can get ""good"" view of the coin I'm interested in investing in is true tradingview. I would also love to get some website with good articles and news regarding the crypto world and market. Most of the apps on my phone regarding crypto are only some sentence long with very few facts. 


Have a lovely Sunday and trade safely pepe :)!

BUY BITCOIN," There is no better way to invest your money than to buy and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For those of you that understand our financial enslavement controlled by the federal reserve \(which is not federal and has no reserves\) but is instead owned and controlled by the Jesuit Rothschild banking dynasty then you know that buying bitcoin is much more than just a monetary investment. In order to escape this modern form of enslavement we as society must get together and overpower them, and that all starts with a collective consciousness. Their system only works for one simple reason, 99&amp;#37; of people just don't know whats going on. They also control all major media outlets and only include what they want you to see while hiding what they don't want you to see. The problem isn't presidents, or governments. They want you confused. The problem is bankers and multinational corporations. The unbacked fiat dollar propped up by the perceived value instilled in society will be decimated and every payment system will be digital and that I'm sure of. As always, its the early investors that get the worm. Imagine investing into Facebook, Google, Amazon, in their earliest stages. Bitcoin is going to be WAYYY bigger than all of that. Bigger than the internet. This is the best opportunity of your lifetime . Don't be that person to work a 9\-5 for 40 plus years and retire with nothing. Thats what they want. Quit school and work on YOU because school is a scam, they control that as well. Research the Prussian ""education"" system that is adopted around the world and you'll soon realize that its not education, but indoctrination. They are very smooth operators and know that it is vital to take control of the minds of our innocent youth in order for their system to work the way it does. Do yourself a favor. Research, Research, Research.

An Inside Look into Venezeula and Cryptocurrency,"I recently conducted a very meaningful interview with Pedro Perez from Venezuela. Well...Pedro isn’t actually his real name, it is the Venezuelan equivalent to John Doe.  He has chosen to remain anonymous because he is scared that the Venezuelan gov’t will be to identify his voice, find him, and then put him in jail.  

If you weren't aware, Venezuela is the edge\-case scenario that Bitcoin was created for.  The gov't hasn't protected the value of its fiat, the Bolivares.  This has resulted in the entire country living in hyperinflation.  It also is being ruled by a dictator that has surveillance throughout the country looking for detractors.  

It is in this context that crypto has become a hedge for many who live there against the rapidly decreasing value of the Bolivares.  However hyperbitcoinization, or reverting to Bitcoin as the standard currency for a nation, hasn't been realized yet.  One of the reasons for this is because the gov't has actually restricted shops to only accept Bolivares.  Other topics we covered were: how much it costs to buy a loaf of bread, what are the on and off ramps to crypto, and even got his insight behind the controversial website Dolar Today.  Oh and of course petrocoin.

"Latest on Freewallet scam. FAKE hashes, FAKE address, exchange SHUT DOWN","A week later, [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) decides to give me a **FAKE hash** on my withdrawal so it appears stuck and cannot be removed. A developer checked into the hash, and told me it **does not exist** and will never transact. He said all Freewallet has to do is rescan their wallets and the balance would reappear so I could make a new transaction. He said this sounds like an intentional tact by them, and obviously it is. They are apparently willing to further damage their name and endure serious problems.

Now that Ive been able to get a developer on my side, AND get Shapeshift on my side, Freewallet has stopped responding to my messages.

I then see, just like any EXIT SCAM will always tend to do, **their services have been shut down as of today.** No exchanging of coins is possible, with no date of resumption given. Classic first step of an exit scam.

My Master Plan,"My current project is building a website for providing dental advice to patients, and monetising in Bitcoin: https://dentaltips.org

If that becomes successful, I will stop working as a clinical dentist. I will use what I raised in Bitcoin to direct/produce/distribute a series of animations about a household cat who learns about monetary history and the banking system. Sesame \(the cat\) experiences conventional money through the perspective of an innocent, naïve, glass\-eyed ragdoll cat. She will learn fast lessons about money, and the importance of privacy in overly dramatic and comedic ways. Sesame will only be able to express herself through meows, and her adventures will be narrated by a deep, calming, Morgan\-Freeman style voice. The style of animation will have a dynamic and bold feel, similar to that of Aggretsuko \(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgPgktxjlaU\). There will be plot intermissions where Sesame can speak and does stand\-up comedy directed at monetary history, banking, and relevant issues in crypto. Her demeanour: quickened vocal cadence, always astonished, hysterically over\-dramatic, and she refers to herself only in third\-person, ie, ""Sesame\-Meow!"" She is horrified by what she learns, and has a constantly startled look \(Exhibit A: https://i.imgflip.com/1qvqpo.jpg\). It will be glorious and I hope to distribute it freely on as many platforms in as many languages as it could reach. 

I would also like \(with permission\) to incorporate Andreas Antonopolous in Aggretsuko\-form as the Yoda persona. Perhaps his motif is that he appears incognito, drops a golden nugget of wisdom, then disappears once a while. I would like to have \(also with permission\) the Magical Crypto Friends’ throughout the series as cameos. 

***I am hiring in Bitcoin*** \- animators who are interested in producing the following trilogy project with me. I will pay a minimum of 1 BTC per scene \+ agreed\-upon &amp;#37; of BTC that the project earns. Please send me samples of the style/artwork you intend to use for the following:

Opening scene: Track: [L’indecis – Soulful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZguAEoNpZw). Sesame is a disenfranchised 9\-5 worker in the human world. Gloomy subway to work, armed police on corners of street, cameras and surveillance, monotonous office work. Things are seemingly great, but always catches a glimpse of other side the coin \(ignored evils of world, poverty, racial profiling\), existential dreads on way home, low\-key bar/lounge, passes out @1:50. Then as music changes @ 1:55, Sesame dreams scenes of economic collapse \(2007\-2008\), protest, civil unrest, war, hunger, fade to black. 

Interim scene: Track: [Cyne – The Raven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEzGdthxeLU). Sesame is Satoshi Nakamoto, discreet cloak\-and\-daggers look. Avoids noise of outside world, hunkers down in secrecy and begins coding. While she’s coding, scenes of unjust/wrongful things play in foreground \(environmental waste, economic enslavement by banks, war, breaches of privacy\), after each scene, Sesame is more determined, works faster, more furiously, a little angsty. Music stops. Scene ends with Sesame at exhaustion as she launches the Genesis block. \(RIP Hal Finney\).

Last Scene: Track: [Kenichiro Nishihara – Believe \(Cise Star\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJKo87XKyk4). Sesame watches mankind, hidden away from plain sight as cats do. Watches small communities form to discuss and contribute to Bitcoin. Sesame wakes up looking forward for more progress, feeling hopeful and refreshed. Gloom fading from scenes. Watches communities grow larger, attends public events with larger crowds. Strength in numbers, watches Venezuela use and adopt Bitcoin. Scenes of unification of people, revolution without guns or violence. Sesame, satisfied with her life\-work, nod of approval then transcends to spirit form.

I don’t care if you steal this idea \- I wish you success and hope you do it with heart.

"The 7 blockchain ""scams"" that you must know","Where there are people there are jianghu, not to mention “one day in the coin circle, one year in the world.” The blockchain has been very popular, and many people have taken advantage of the overnight rich mentality to enter the market, but gain nothing. Not only investors but also people with ulterior motives are eyeing this market. This article lists the common seven “scams” in the market, and hopes that the investors will bypass the pit.

01 **Decentralization can do anything**

Trick: The core of the blockchain is decentralization. Now that we are under the leadership of the management, withdrawals are made through bank transfers.This is all centralized. It is wrong. Decentralization in the future will completely change the status quo. So join us now. There will be no centralization to restrain us. We use decentralization to change the world.

Truth: although decentralization is one of the important value characteristics of blockchain, it should be noted that this application is not applicable to all fields. Blind copying not only fails to improve efficiency, increase trust, but also cause damage.

02 **White paper is landing application**

Trick: For some people who have not entered the coin circle or know nothing about coin circle, some people with ulterior motives often talk about the white paper. Some token projects have already published their own white papers, and they have written in English. The team's curriculum vitae have been astounding and winning numerous awards. , has long been a winner in life. Therefore, their project is almost invincible.

Truth:The generalization of the word “Tricks” is that packaging, fulfillment and production of white papers do not follow decentralization and can be apocryphal, and the most critical technical descriptions are also very subtle and obscure, let alone landing applications. So, with the white paper there is only a book, everyone needs to polish your eyes

03 **Celebrity advertise for project, Authoritative proof**

Trick:This situation does not need to say more, it is ubiquitous. To be honest, many celebrities are innocent. For example, Li Xiaolai said in an interview with CCTV Financial on May 22 that in most cases, he was reported that advertised for some projects, in fact, he didn’t.

*Processing img pd5csbvm2k011...*

Truth:Celebrities advertise for projects and have authority. This is a common trick for many products, blockchain scam is no exception, of course, celebrity support does have some benefits, but excessive publicity efforts on celebrities, but will make people skeptical the project itself is unreliable.

"Demystifying the Definition ""peer-to-peer""","As r/Bitcoin and the rest of the computer science community interprets the term:

&gt;**Peer\-to\-peer** \(**P2P**\) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers  are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They  are said to form a peer\-to\-peer network of nodes. \- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)

As r/btc interprets the term:

HELP! - Bitcoin ID/Age Authentication Problem,"Hi guys,

A few months ago, I opened up a bitcoin account with CEX.IO, however, i was only 17.

Amazingly, using my $350 laptop and MS Paint, i was able to change the DOB on my ID to make it look like I was 18.

Since i have a new phone i cant access the 2 factor authentication that CEX.IO uses to log into your account meaning i'm locked out of my account.

Customer support has now asked me to provide a photo of me and my ID to confirm I own the account.

IMPORTANT BIT:
Since I am now 18, can i just use my real ID and will it be ok? Or will they detect that I have a different DOB and lock my account??

Any help is appreciated guys &lt;3",1527506856,28/05/2018 11:27:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mpdjy/help_bitcoin_idage_authentication_problem/,1

Shillerz- The crypto-place to be! (get rewarded for your calls),"Hey guys!

I want to share my first project in the crypto world!

Story / Idea:

As a member of the crypto community, I have always wanted a simple place bringing together the world best crypto traders. And when I say trader, I'm not talking about the “gurus” who erase all the traces of their failed calls. What I want to build in an healthy competition between the best crypto analysts, help them to build their community and reward the best.

From this idea, we decided to create Shillerz, a free social network for all crypto-enthusiasts.

The concept:

Shillerz is a free social network where you can create a call and share it with your community. As a user, you can make a public call (accessible to all) or a paid call (See the picture below) and get paid in Shillcoin ! Shillerz is directly connected to Binance apis in order to calculate the calls’ reliability. Shillerz brings you security thanks to its advanced Rating System; no one can cheat. Once the call is launched it is not possible to delete it. Our cut of the edge algorithm will rank the top Shillerz according to their last predictions. Being in the top 10, will show your dominance and will help you to monetize your future calls..

https://www.shillerz.com/shillerz_explain.png
Shillcoins :

Shillcoin is our e-currency platform. 1 Shillcoin will always equals 1 EUR, you can turn your Shillcoin into EUR and cash it out via Paypal. So, if you are a great analyst you should be able to make some $$$!

Recommended strategy (if you don’t have any followers yet): Shillerz gives you the opportunity to make yourself known. Start by making public call to grow your community and finally become a crypto-influencer, (it will work only if you are good Smiley )

“I just want to follow calls” Shillerz allows you to follow free calls from the world best crypto-trader. You will not miss any train anymore, next : M00N !

Shillerz is now live : https://www.shillerz.com


Example of a call (without registration : https://www.shillerz.com/call/sa2w3BXTQdQTt9BPM)",1527508859,28/05/2018 12:00:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mpjpm/shillerz_the_cryptoplace_to_be_get_rewarded_for/,1

A little guy's story," I've been visiting this subreddit for a while on my personal account, but I got into Bitcoin because of a friend who hyped up it so much I had to invest. Early on, when the price was around $3000, I put in around $20 since I was a bit skeptical and still a high school student who barely has any money. As Bitcoin hit $19,000, I decided it was time to pull out and profit. I've been running very low on money lately, but it's been because of Bitcoin that I was able to continue to pay my Apple Developer $99 fee, and I felt it was important to share my story for all the little people investing in crypto. Today is the day all my work comes to life, where I launch my second app to the AppStore \(called **Singularities**\), and I am glad to say that this app could not have happened without Bitcoin.

Banks are teaming up to shut down crypto businesses that are dealing with FIAT - how would you react?,"Struggling to find a bank for my crypto business as every bank in my country outright refuses to deal with crypto businesses. They simply won't let you open a corporate account. The moment you mention crypto or bitcoin they reply with a canned response: ""We are currently not accepting clients in this area of business."" 

My business is a FIAT-to-crypto exchange, which certainly doesn't help. I have had so many rejections now that it's getting ridicoulous. It's like they had some meeting where they all agreed to reply with the same line whenever a company that deals with crypto asked them to open an account.    

What are my options here? I am sure I could find a bank in some foreign country but that takes away a huge part of my business model as I can no longer offer national bank transfers as a payment method. 

I see no obvious solution for getting around their embargo but I can think of a few possibilities:

1) Outright avoid mentioning crypto. Deal with the consequences and frozen accounts later (probably not a good idea). 

2) Rebrand the business to be a blockchain company instead of an exchange. Have some blockchain-related activity be the main activity of the company. Make the exchange a secondary activity that is still necessary to support the primary activity. Banks tend to be more willing to deal with blockchain companies.

3) Write a really good sales pitch and hope it will convince them (probably naive). 

What do you guys think? How to bypass the embargo?

A Guide To Trading Futures,"In the stock trading industry, many people have garnered a lot of money from futures markets. It is only in this arena where people who have limited capitals can actually make substantial profits even in a short period of time. But because like any other market, this involves a lot of risks and may cost you significant losses, people may often fear to get involved. 

Despite its bad reputation however, many experts would claim that futures trading could only be as risky as you want to make it. And if you take on good strategies and give yourself the proper exposure, then this can make you very rich. 

What Are Futures?

Futures are standardized and transferable contracts that require a buyer to purchase a stock at a specific sum and within a certain time period in the future. This contract gives the buyer the obligation of purchase, and the seller the obligation to deliver the specific asset traded.

Unlike options, futures contracts obligate the traders to buy and sell instead of just merely giving them the right. 

People basically profit from futures by performing speculations in order to provide liquidity and to assume risks for price fluctuations in the market. These valuable functions provide them with substantial returns and potentially large gains. But take note that along with these, substantial risks are involved as well. 

How And Why Are Futures Traded?

Trading futures has become quite popular in many markets, especially in day trading. These kinds of trades offer a wide variety of markets and it can be traded at a low cost. 

Futures can be traded in both up and down markets. If a particular trader expects the market to go up, a long trade is usually done wherein the trader buys a contract and then sells it. On the contrary, if a trader believes that the market will go down, and then he will most probably make a short trade by entering a trade through selling a contract and then exiting by buying another contract. 

With this system, traders are able to profit regardless of what direction the market trends are going. This is the main reason why most traders are only concerned if the market is moving at all, instead of which direction it is actually going. 

In futures trading, instead of taking or making deliveries, a trader merely speculates his position in the market’s volatility by predicting directions of trends. If prices move in the right direction, then the trader would be able to profit. If this does not happen, then a trader would experience some losses.

-------------------
This particular arena in trading can be very promising, but it involves so many risks as well. But if you are well experienced in trading stocks and have adopted quite an understanding in the different trends, behaviors and strategies that the industry has to offer, then chances are, you may probably do well in this particular playing field. 

All of this may sound pretty easy at the moment, but if you are planning to engage in futures trading, make sure that you do your research and prepare yourself with the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully execute transactions.

Along with huge profits possible, there are a lot of risks involved and trading futures without the right background can be very detrimental.

I've been mining bitcoin for 30 months. Here are some VERY interesting facts:,"Tl; Dr --- Just skip to the last paragraph.

I have met with numerous large mining operations in the last two years (in the US, a few countries in Europe and China). I have seen a lot of different ways to set up mining centers.

The miners who pay the least in electricity pay about $0.03 per kwh. These are miners based in Washington State and some small operations in the European Alps. Both of these operations use hydro power.

Chinese miners pays about $0.04 per kwh. Some pay a little less and some pay a little more.

Some miners are inefficient at cooling and some are very efficient. Using HVAC is the most expensive. The small operations in the Alps are using the natural cool air to cool their miners. This seems to be the most cost-effective. The next most cost-effective is liquid submersion cooling.

Natural air-cooled mining centers are the cheapest to build. They basically just need fans to pull in the cool outside air and exhaust fans to exhaust it. These systems add about 5% in energy consumption for each miner.

HVAC is pretty costly to purchase and adds about 25% in energy consumption to each miner.

Liquid submersion cooling is very expensive to build but it is the most efficient. You can disconnect the cooling fans when the miner is submerged in liquid. This saves about 8% on energy usage per miner. So, liquid submersion cooling actually SAVES energy costs BUT it is crazy expensive to build.

S9 miner = 0.00082 btc per day = $6 per day
Cost of electricity for each S9 miner = $1.25 per day
Cost of electricity for each air cooling for each S9 = $0.07 per day
Cost of electricity for HVAC per S9 = $0.25 per day
Cost of electricity for liquid cooling per S9 = $0 per day

So, the miners who pay $0.03 - $0.04 per kwh AND spent the millions on liquid submersion cooling are the miners who can remain running the longest when the price drops substantially.

People feel that Bitmain has a distinct advantage in mining because they build the miners AND they run them as well. I have determined that this is NOT an issue at all for large miners who purchased their systems prior to February, 2018. If you purchased your miners before the recent drop really kicked in (around February) then you could have sold them after purchasing for a profit of $1,000 (then you would, obviously, immediately re-purchase). This will put your cost of each miner in line with Bitmain. Thus...you are on even ground with them as a competitor.

Most large miners bought their equipment and built their mining infrastructure when the price was rising. This means that most large miners are in VERY good positions because their infrastructure is likely paid off.

So, the best miners are currently making about $5 per day in profits for each miner. And the best of the best are making about $6 per day.

Bitmain has had the same miner for a long time. There has been no risk in owning this ""old tech"" for much longer than you'd own a server in a data center without any upgrades.

So, what does it all mean? Well, if the largest miners have already paid for their miners and infrastructure (which they have), then these miners can still be profitable at a bitcoin price of $7300.

The price is pulling towards $7300 right now. Some large miners will start to shut down, temporarily, at about $7000.

I pay $0.00 per kwh for electricity because I built an off-grid, solar operation in the middle of the desert. And my exisiting miners have an average cost of $0 since I bought the miners over a year ago and I sold them after about 3 months of use (then I bought new ones from Bitmain). I'm NEVER gonna stop mining, regardless of price. But I only have about 1,000 miners. I think there are about 2 million miners currently working. I am not even noise on the network.

Bottom line: The majority of miners on the network are large miners. They aren't going to start turning off until about $6800-7000. I'm curious to see what happens if it drops to this level for a while. SUPER curious.",1527526137,28/05/2018 16:48:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mrher/ive_been_mining_bitcoin_for_30_months_here_are/,1

I went from not knowing the f*ck is Bitcoin to dropping $$$ in less than half an hour - a mini biography.,"So, this was from around March or so - but I figured I share it now since I finally found you all (I know - im late to everything, even to have a Reddit).....


Anyway, back in around when BTC first dropped from the glorious $16k to around $8k or so - I went to sleep the night before without any knowledge of how BTC works, or what it is really.

Yet.

On that fateful day at 9:21am, I suddenly woke up with an overwhelming desire that -

I. Must. Buy.

So I FB message this pal in Netherlands of mine who’s huge BTC freaks like y’all. He told me the basics, get CoinBase, offline wallet, blah blah blah.

I was still half-asleep, yet here I am chatting away with a dude who I “friended” after a hilarious banter about the merit of wearing gloves while washing dishes on FB! He’s a lovely dude, tried to drop me his Dutch-mixtape but I’ already forgive him for that.

And so, I was having this strange trancelike state of mind when I downloaded CoinBase, linked my safety CreditCard and bank. And BAM! 

0.1 BTC is now mine.

The whole process was completed by 9:58am on the same day.

I then promptly went back to my depression sleep for another 22~ hours until my alarm (ahem...mother dearest) blared at me to go to work. 

And even when I stared real hard at the CoinBase wallet and at my bank statement the next few days after - it still didn’t hit me that I just might very well threw a month saving away.

(I was also diagnosed with ADD and some other fuckeries a few months later...bruv)

But anyway.

It was like I was overcame by a Bitcoinholic ghost who took over my whole psyche and just yeehawed my ass down this road. I still remember the clothe I was wearing, the noises outside my window, the smell of how much I need to take a fucking shower. 

It was like a crystal clear snapshot moment. The kind you see in Hollywood movies when the MC’s life gets a fuckover, but in a nicer sense.


Now, BTC has some up and down since then, and I duly fucked up when I missed out on the chance to acquire more during the deathcross at $6k. 

But man.

Ever since that fateful day, while my investment hasn’t fully “paid off” or whatever. It’s like a whole new road all around me.

And it didn’t fully hit when I bought some...ahem... illicit(ish) drugs using BTC.
 
Even when done the above multiple time.

No. It fully hit when I listed some items I needed gone on FB market and wrote:

“Cash/VENMO/PayPal/ or Bitcoin”

/That’s/ when it fully hit. The moment I realize I officially see BTC as something tangible. 

A real currency. 

Now, it’s harder to explain to my mum that I legit dropped $1k+ on BTC...

She froze my bank account for awhile - which set off a dark, depressive mood  (I’ve experienced that before - however, this time it’s more...tangible? Because I realize I still have more than enough BTC for a handgun to pop-off ). 


But you gotta forgive her, I did after a few weeks.  

We’re Asian to the core, and as her only daughter - I might as well be telling her to her face that her, “19yrs old, graduated from college 2yrs early and now have a decent job working from home” daughter is shooting up heroin or gamble like a moth to flame... 

But now that I finally split my finances from her, BTC has got my heart all tight. 

So Ode to BTC my good men.

(If any of you chaps actually have some literature talent, feel free to compose an actual Ode)

For Our Lord Satoshi-Dono has blessed us with such an incredible gift.



P.S
((Now, even though I did graduated two years early - im still dead broke. So uh.... feel free to drop this poor lassie a few coin.. ;)

Upcoming Bitcoin Protocol Upgrades?,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone had any rough estimates on any base-layer upgrades Bitcoin could seen in the next 1-2 years

* Schnorr Sigs

* MASTs

* MimbleWimble

* DriveChains

Could we see privacy features such as RingCT and/or stealth addresses. If bulletproofs undergo enough testing, are devs looking at that as a possible upgrade?

Also, is Bitcoin going to see a small/medium blocksize increase in the near/mid future?

I know a big piece of the argument on why Segwit2x was disliked was it didn't have enough testing or review, people felt like it was too rushed even at 6 months of lead up time. If we need 8+ months to properly deploy a blocksize increase, is there a timeline for how that'd work?

This isn't your typical crypto app. First, I believe we have the most functional news aggregator \(and it gets better and better every day\). The twist here is we have a lot of social integrations that will allow people engage in ways that are most useful. The entire premise is that you can't do all research yourself and this app will help you and your team extract and share what's most relevant to you. Second, we won't just be news. While I don't want to give away the whole enchilada just yet, we want to make sure that what we do release is the best that it can be.

"Surprisingly accurate prediction: ""I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes""","""Re: Scalability
Bitcointalk

2010-07-14 21:10:52 UTC

The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain.  In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks.  It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself. 

The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node. 

I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less.  It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in.  The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.

At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.""

Historical number of nodes in the network (floats near 10k mark):

Why Buying Bitcoin is so Important Right Now,"What is happening is that bears that likely have multiple accounts are trying to bring down the price of Bitcoin by intentionally being as negative as they possibly can be in every single post that has any positive sentiment.

You have to ask what is their motivation?  Why would a poster that had no financial interest bring up every possible negative thing they can think of in posts all over these forums?  Because they do have a financial interest.  They want to buy Bitcoin more cheaply.

And it's working in the short term.  You can stick a dagger in their scheme by buying even a small amount of bitcoin and holding on to it.  

Now you're going to see them flood this thread and imply that I'm just someone who is doing the same thing because I am losing money and need everyone else to buy so that I can sell.

It's not true the way they are making it seem.  I believe that the demand for Bitcoin is increasing everyday.  What we can do is change the momentum by buying a little extra.  Fear Doubt and Uncertainty are needed by them.

They know that sentiment is one of the factors that people use to determine if it's a good time to buy Bitcoin.  Knowing that to be true they flood the forums with negativity and then they can say ""oh look how negative the sentiment is, it's a bad time to buy"".  Then when they have knocked 2k off of the price and the risk is too high for them they become bullish all of a sudden.

It's bullshit.  The best way to win is to buy some bitcoin.",1527543865,28/05/2018 21:44:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mtnpf/why_buying_bitcoin_is_so_important_right_now/,5

The biggest hurdle for using BTC as a currency,"I've been experimenting a bit recently with using Bitcoin as an actual currency (yes, BUYING stuff with it, not just speculating on it to make USD money). For me the biggest issue with using it this way currently is the inconveniently long confirmation times. I love being able to scan a QR code on my computer screen and using my phone to send the money. No credit card numbers, no passwords, no bank account info; it feels so much safer and smoother than paying with fiat currency. But I hate buying a digital product and having to wait an hour+ for the payment to confirm. The whole point of buying a digital product is so you can have instant access to it. Waiting for payments to confirm defeats the whole purpose. As a dabbling end user, I feel this is the most important area that BTC needs to be improved before it can have any hope of being adopted as a medium of exchange on a wide scale.",1527552343,29/05/2018 00:05:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mum1g/the_biggest_hurdle_for_using_btc_as_a_currency/,3
"New to Bitcoin, very basic questions...","Hi, I've seen a ton of texts and videos trying to explain bitcoins and codes and miners and whatnot... But I'm new to this, and just looking for answers to practical questions. So I opened an account on blockchain.info with $5 for testing... 

1.I'm wondering, are there other wallet sites beside this one and if so, what are the differences? Which one is the ""best"" one? 

2.Is it possible for these wallet sites to be fraudulent and just empty your wallet and bail? can they even do this? or rather what's stopping them from doing this one day? and if they do, is there any way to get your money back in either dollars or bitcoins? 
(remember Carlos from Bitconneeeeeect... lol)

3.And lastly, can these wallet sites just flat ban you? if they do, what happens to your bitcoins and how can you get your money back again in dollars or bitcoins?",1527552991,29/05/2018 00:16:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8muom4/new_to_bitcoin_very_basic_questions/,4

If you haven't used the Bisq exchange (decentralized) you should give it a try,"I recently downloaded the software and I have been very impressed so far. 
It is quite easy to install and setup. 

Now that localbitcoins.com requires ID, this is the easiest way to buy bitcoin anonymously. It's also  much less scammy.

Decentralized exchanges are the only way to prevent governments shutdowns and interference. Think BitTorrent for buying and selling Bitcoin. 

I highly recommend trying out a small order so that you are familiar with how things work. The volume is quite low at the moment so this would help the network grow.

"Your brain is the new Cold Storage, Check out my new iOS app KeySnap!","[KeySnap Article](https://medium.com/@andrew.searson/keysnap-7d384ba33177)

TLDR, you can generate crypto keys and seeds with familiar text using KeySnap. This way you will always be able to recover funds using just your memory.

**There are a few good benefits of generating Seeds using KeySnap:**

1. It gives an easy avenue for you to recover lost Seeds. No need to worry about losing your phone, crypto wallet password, hard drive or forgetting where your Cold Storage wallet is. You can just recover your Seed with the text you chose to generate it.
2. You can verbally explain where your money is to anyone else if you are in a pinch.
3. You can KeySnap existing Seeds and increment your pin to create a single account dependency. One Key to rule them all.

**Things to consider:**

The variety in what humans use for text in generating Keys might not be as unique as a random generated key so make sure your text is extensive and clever but memorable enough to recall if you had to. Those using KeySnap sacrifice true randomness for the security of being able to recover funds from memory. As Crypto starts to take hold you are your own bank and KeySnap is one more tool in your belt for managing that security.

**Things to Note when Keysnapping:**

KeySnap does not consider blank characters \(spaces,carriage returns,etc..\) as input. It will scrub these so no need to worry about multiple spaces in the text you use

KeySnap is case sensitive so 'a' and 'A' will return different results

KeySnap is meant to be used offline and does not store any data including key, picture or text data. What good would it be if someone could physically get your keys from your phone or if you could only generate these using a web API where others could listen in.

I am looking for feedback!! Feel free to be brutally honest. This app costs .99 on the apple store. It would undermine the app if I monetized it with ads since it is intended to be used offline with no memory storage on the device. As such it might not be super flashy but if the cost of .99 helps you recover 1,000's in cryptocurrency then it is worth it.",1527574461,29/05/2018 06:14:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mwumf/your_brain_is_the_new_cold_storage_check_out_my/,1

We Have to Go to War With Bears,"They are playing dirty.  If you hold Bitcoin and say and do nothing while you lose money you let them cost you money.  Bulls have to fight back.  Even if it's 20 dollars on Coinbase pick up a little bit extra.  It only requires stopping the momentum a little bit here.

They are going to be all over this thread.  They want so badly to knock this price down.  We can stop it.  I've moved 10 percent of my alts into Bitcoin.

That goes a long way to messing up the bots trading because they are targeting different ratios at different prices on the alts.  That causes them to buy into the alts to keep the ratios at historic levels because they see the price ""out of balance.  The new demand for btc causes the price of btc to increase (if done on a large enough scale).  The increase in the btc price causes the ratio to become out of balance and the bots to buy the alts to keep it in balance.

The key is to move 10 percent out of alts to get most of the gains from the increase in alts when the price of btc goes up.  

Almost all negative posts on here are planned FUD.  The manipulation is that extreme.",1527577522,29/05/2018 07:05:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mx3qk/we_have_to_go_to_war_with_bears/,2

Bitcoin doesnt need stability...,"It just needs low volatility.

Bitcoin (due to its reducing issuance) will never be stable against the dollar. Instead it will beome an asset that acts more like property in a healthy debt free economy. An asset that generally keeps up with inflation if not slightly ahead of inflation. It will have very low volatility and simply track upwards by a couple of percent per year when measured against the dollar.

This is the end goal and most likely outcome. A form of money with more ease of use than fiat and store of value properties similar to owning property.",1527595817,29/05/2018 12:10:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8myl75/bitcoin_doesnt_need_stability/,1

⚡ New Lightning-enabled store to buy games for Steam/Origin/Uplay/Battle.net: Joltfun,"Hello everyone!

Today I'm happy to introduce you to a project I've been working on since the past few months: [Joltfun.com](https://joltfun.com)

This is a store that offers you to buy games with the Lightning Network for popular venues such as Steam/Origin/Uplay/Battle.net.

Not only can you use bitcoin as a currency, but over Lightning it comes with the advantage of instant delivery: no need to wait for lengthy confirmations, you get game codes in seconds, ready to be activated.

Feel free to open a channel to our node at: 02977901c53b5299c7641acf11d49a46f0957e9e3f8191e6171d1222486d872317@54.37.22.216:9889

If you don't feel #reckless enough to use Lightning yet or if it's not working for you \(remember, the network's still pretty much in beta\), don't worry on\-chain payments are supported as well. We process transactions directly to our own Segwit\-enabled wallet and without going through nasty intermediary payment processors charging high fees \(if you know what I mean\).

Entropic Coin Loss,"Only 21 million coins exist. Of those 21 million, 18&amp;#37; have not been moved in 5 years or more. As more people lose their bitcoins, this creates a supply crunch. 

On the other side of the equation, fewer and fewer bitcoins will be mined each year until finally no more bitcoins will be mined. At this point, the only transaction rewards to miners will be from fees. This will result in the network having less hashrate.

I see two problems that could be solved by tossing them at each other in the long run. If we want bitcoin to survive beyond 100 years, then we need to implement a system that prevents loss of btc from the economy OR we will need to increase the divisibility of BTC. One or the other, maybe even both. If bitcoin replaces major world currencies such as the USD, then we are going to be forced to do this. 

So, how could this be done? Well, for starters, if a bitcoin has gone untouched for 75 years, we know that the original buyer is likely dead. They don't need their bitcoin, and their descendents have not moved it. The bitcoin has been lost to humanity. 

So, here is my proposal:  
For all wallets that have not had a transaction for 74 years, a message should be sent to the wallet warning them to move their bitcoin and perform a transaction ANY transaction will do, they just need to demonstrate a pulse. If after 75 years the wallet has not had its bitcoin moved, the wallet balance is zeroed out on the blockchain, and the amount for the wallet zero\-out is given to the base monetary supply in order to reward miners. This means that miners will have continuous supply of bitcoin to reward them, no bitcoin will be lost to death, and bitcoin shall be eternal forever and ever in satoshi's name, Amen.",1527607149,29/05/2018 15:19:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mzwix/entropic_coin_loss/,1

Dan from San Diego is a liar and here is the proof,"My post was delted this morning but I am posting again because I have read all of Dan from San Diego posts and he is nothing but a liar.

This is his fake website that he just made to pretend about owning his giant farm in the desert.

https://www.verycleanfoods.com/the-team.html

The people on the website are not found using searches. The picture of Dan is fake and looks like it was from a magazine. There is no place to order his vegetables from his fake farm.

He claims to be a doctor and also a phd mathematician and also is a quantum organic chemistry which doesn't even exist at any school in the world.

And he owns a clinic. And thousands of bitcoin. He challenges everyone to bet him millions when you challenge him. And he bought a yacht from bets he made on reddit. Do you believe any of this?

For those that don't already know, the Chilean banks closed their accounts - led by Santander &amp; Banco Estado &amp; quickly followed by all the others.

Buda took them to court and won an injunction forcing the banks to reinstate their accounts under the previous conditions. Looks like its finally happening.

i also checked the details on blockchain info. here i can see the word (unspent/not used) next to the wallet address of the receiver.

what is the problem? why it is somehow stuck? what can i do now? i checked in the help section of multibit and tried different things.. but the result is still the same. receiver says he did not get.

i hope someone of you guys can help me and tell me what i need to do.

Question about the Halvening,"I'm having trouble understanding an aspect of the halvening, and was hoping someone here could help. Basically, my concern is that if the difficulty doubles (which is essentially what the reward halving would mean, I think?) but we don't see a fast enough (or far-enough-in-advance) market response, could it cause the profitability of mining to dip drastically enough quickly enough to close/hurt a significant number of mining operations? In which case, could it actually case a dip in price, or even some sort of crash?

If this is a stupid question, apologies. I think part of it is that I still don't quite understand the correlation between mining profitability and general price...",1527614040,29/05/2018 17:14:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n0tjt/question_about_the_halvening/,1

Empirical analysis of the cryptoasset ecosystem: University of Cambridge research study is looking for participants!,"Hello again\*,

The [Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance \(CCAF\)](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/), an academic research centre at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, is conducting the second edition of its Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study.

The goal of this research study is to present a comprehensive empirical picture of the global cryptoasset activities and provide novel insights into the current state and evolution of the ecosystem.

The **first edition** of the Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study, published in April 2017 and freely available for download on our [website](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/global-cryptocurrency/), featured non\-public data from over 140 cryptoasset companies and entities. It has received worldwide media coverage and interest from industry, policymakers and researchers. It has been mentioned in publications such as the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/23/the-guardian-view-on-cryptocurrencies-bubble-and-chic), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/apaul/2017/11/27/its-1994-in-cryptocurrency/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/turning-coal-into-bitcoin-dirty-secret-of-2017-s-hottest-market) and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-environment-green-energy-power-global-warming-climate-change-a8094661.html), and was cited in reports of the [World Bank](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/8a338a98-75cd-4771-b94c-5b6db01e2797/IFC-EMCompass-BlockchainReport_WebReady.pdf?MOD=AJPERES)and the [Financial Stability Board](http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R270617.pdf), among others.

Today, we are releasing **two surveys** that are directed towards miners and service providers \(e.g. exchanges, wallets, payment service providers\). If you are active in one of these areas, we would be delighted to have you contribute to this study. All survey links can also be found on our [website](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/research/live-research-surveys/) \([http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty\-research/centres/alternative\-finance/research/live\-research\-surveys/](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/research/live-research-surveys/)\). The surveys are available in **English, Spanish, and Chinese**.\*\* To avoid phishing attempts, please make sure to you use the survey links from the live research surveys page to take the survey\*\*.

Please note that most questions are optional and do not require a response. Individual responses will be anonymised, and findings will only be presented at the aggregate level \(e.g. by activity, region, etc.\). **All identifying information concerning you and/or your organisation’s responses will be removed from the published study**. All survey participants have the option to be prominently acknowledged in the benchmarking report with their logo displayed.

The findings of this research study will be presented in Q3 2018 in a report that will be freely available on our [website](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/)like all our previous reports. We would like to thank you in advance for contributing to this research study. If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact the principal investigator Michel Rauchs by email \([m.rauchs@jbs.cam.ac.uk](https://www.reddit.com/)\).

Thoughts?,"**Credit inflation is good: it produces artificial prosperity through artificial demand.**

**Credit deflation is bad: it produces a collapse in demand and high unemployment.**

The higher the debt levels are the worse the proceding credit deflation is. Also known as a depression.

**Price inflation is bad: cost of living constantly increases leading to a lower standard of living.**

**Price deflation is good: consumer prices falling leads to a higher standard of living, a reward for becoming more innovative and efficient at producing goods over time.**

Central bank manipulated interest rates cause artifical credit expansion. So free market interest rates that rise and fall along with demand for loans would prevent excessive credit creation, making catastrophic credit deflation a non issue.

Money printed out of nothing causes price inflation, so sound money would allow stable prices and slight price deflation. The more innovative we are as a society the more the cost of living falls which is a great thing and the way the world should work.

Solution = bitcoin + interest rates set by the free market in aggregate.

Bitcoin + P2P lending might just be the begining of a global golden age of prosperity.",1527622459,29/05/2018 19:34:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n1y9g/thoughts/,1

\- When the 2016th block gets mined, who propagates the new difficulty, and how does the nodes learn about it?

\- Do block headers contain current difficulty?

Promises of huge OTC deal on the regular in the last few months - is this is common scam? How does it work?,"Hey guys I'm a small time OTC dealer, 70\-100k max for my larger transactions. I took the time to come out of lurking to ask a question, because i'm genuinely curious now \- in the last few months i've been approached by parties I 'knew', and i use the term loosely, sort of long time acquaintances, asking me if I could trade literal billions of bitcoin. 2 billion here, 3 billion there. Insane amounts basically.

Honestly if I didn't know these people I would have immediately thought 'scam' but in the end I tried looking for sellers and of course no one had enough BTC on hand even if i pooled them. Yesterday, another one of these deals landed on my lap, again another 'long lost friend' who i have no reason to think would scam me. I must be on the 10th in 6 months now.

All seem motivated by the promise of large intermediary commissions that could sort them for life.  All are signing documents including KYC and AML. And to be fair, it sounds a lot like this: [https://news.bitcoin.com/how\-an\-otc\-bitcoin\-scammer\-almost\-stole\-600\-million/](https://news.bitcoin.com/how-an-otc-bitcoin-scammer-almost-stole-600-million/). But what i don't understand, is that the ultimate buyer and seller are never known, including to my 'friend'. So technically, either i'm being targeted directly on the odd chance i know a trillionnaire, OR it's a repeated scam  that's very common, like the Nigerian prince email one, but no one is talking about it. 

What do you think? Where does this scam originate from? Who's running them? thanks!",1527623605,29/05/2018 19:53:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n245i/promises_of_huge_otc_deal_on_the_regular_in_the/,1

It’s halvening-halvening!,"We've just mined [block #525000](https://blockchain.info/block-height/525000)! **Wohoo!**

That means right now we're exactly halfway between Bitcoin's second and third halvening (the point in time where the block-reward drops by 50%, which happens every *210000 blocks* or *~4 years*).
Why does this matter? Well, it means only half as many coins are being put into circulation, and thus only half as many new coins can potentially be sold to interested buyers. Supply vs. demand, yada, yada... the price should increase!


The last halvening took place on *July 9 2016*, which is *1 year 10 months 20 days ago* (a total of *689 days*). That means we are statistically about **41 days ahead of schedule** to reach this halfway-point (which would be *730 days* per design)! Thanks to the *ever-rising* hashing power, blocks have been found [quicker than the targeted 10 minutes mark](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty) - and of course there's always variance!.


**Sooo... where does that leave us?**

* If we keep the current hashrate (or keep on deploying/removing it in a way that we achieve a block-time of *exactly 10 minutes on average* until *block 630000* (the next halvening!)) - we would need another *730 days* - which would let the next halvening happen on **May 28 2020**!

* If we keep on deploying more hashrate *at the same rate* as since the last halvening - we would only need another *689 days* - which would make the magic already happen on **April 17 2020**!


When do you think this exciting day is going to take place? Any guesses? Let's revisit in approx. 2 years and figure out who won!",1527625511,29/05/2018 20:25:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n2dqy/its_halveninghalvening/,1

Arts &amp; Cryptocurrency : a new BTC-denominated shop,"Hello there, 

I've opened a BTC\-denominated shop. Please check this out!

\-\&gt; [https://shop.gohuozumi.com](https://shop.gohuozumi.com)

This shop deals in my limited edition art pieces in cryptocurrency. Such as,

*Processing img 557bghu2vu011...*

*Processing img gcjy2t55vu011...*

The upper image is a glitched piece of the news paper, ""The Times 03/Jan/2009"", which was written into the genesis\-block of Bitcoin.  

\-\&gt; [https://shop.gohuozumi.com/product/the\-times](https://shop.gohuozumi.com/product/the-times)

And The lower image is ""Virtual Virtual Coins"" that was generated as uncertain future coins by artificial intelligence which learned existing most crypto\-currencies or fiat\-currencies.  

\-\&gt; [https://shop.gohuozumi.com/product/virtual\-virtual\-coins\-v\-2\-r3](https://shop.gohuozumi.com/product/virtual-virtual-coins-v-2-r3)

These pieces were actually exhibited at art museums such as HongKong Art Center and ICC\-in\-Tokyo.  Also there are other pieces in the shop.

I hope you like the arts!

\-\-\-

I have a matching problem. I can't estimate the target customers that what kind of people are interested and will buy it.

Generally, most people related to arts don't know or hold cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. On the contrary, some people still believe that it's a fraud.

Also, I hadn't heard topics about people who are familiar with Bitcoin and buys the arts. In recent years, art auctions and so on targeting digital\-technology\-related people are held, mainly in the United States. Even if the speculative purpose that aims the future price increase of art piece is preceded, the target range of the art collector is expanding.

How are Lapp similar to Dapp?,"I read from somewhere that they claim LAPP is just like DAPP but better.

My question is, how do we specify smart contracts in the lightning network? As far as I understand, they are just payment channels that are interconnected. So the state is only about balances. In what way in the lightning network can I deploy a smart contract, where I am able to specify some logic that will get executed when having some balance sent to it? And how would I be able to persist anything at all? As far as I understand, lightning network doesn't have a way to persist custom data? 

Where is a good place to start reading how to build LAPP?

Are LAPP basically centralized app that uses lightning network as micro payment options? But how is that DAPP???

Almost done with bitcoin infographic- need validation on how bitcoins are created though.,"The relationship display can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/ajzaSz9.png)- I don't think it is right and based off my discussions with other users, I've been told to reorder it to- 1, 2, 3, 6, 8+4, 5, 7, 9; I wanted to validate whether this would be right, and whether you as the community, would like to see any other changes to this display.

The infographic is meant to be accessible to people not familiar with bitcoin, so I'm hoping to keep many of its technicalities away from this display. Other than that, the infographic is almost done- this is the last thing that needs validation. I'll share a high-resolution, complete one with you folks in a separate post once I've modified this display. 

Thanks for all the help and feedback over the past few weeks though, you folks as the r/bitcoin community have been a fantastic bunch to work with and there's no doubt in my mind that this project would not be possible without you all. :) ",1527637167,29/05/2018 23:39:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n3uor/almost_done_with_bitcoin_infographic_need/,1
"Bitcoin is extremely safe against 51% attacks. For comparison, BCH is NOT safe, 6 bitcoin pools alone can 51% attack it at this very moment.","I'm sure everyone heard about 51% attacks on BTG, Verge and many other shitcoins. You might ask, well, can this happen to bitcoin? The answer is it's extremely improbable. No pool has 51% of the bitcoin hashrate to themselves, and there is only one other coin that share the mining algo. Only other coin that uses SHA256 mining algo is BCH. Is BCH safe? Let's do some math. As can be seen [here](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate), current hashrate for BTC is 25.69 EH/S and BCH is 4.75 EH/S. This means to pull of a 51% attack on bitcoin, you need 13.10 EH/S and to pull it off on BCH you need 2.42 EH/S. Who has 2.42 EH/S hashrate? Mining pools BTC.com, Antpool, BTC.top, Slushpool, ViaBTC and F2Pool currently has more than this amount, as can be seen [here](https://btc.com/). So in conclusion, these 6 pools can switch a button and take control of bch network in any moment.

[**GDXM Terminal**](https://terminal.gdxm.io/) is an evolution of [**GDXM**](https://gdmx.io/)’s first version released few months ago. Due to an high increase of users, and thanks to their feedback, we have updated the app UI with new features \(others will be released in the near future\).

https://www.crypto-coinz.net/bitmain-b3-miner-cracked-and-ported-for-nvidia-gpus-strike-back/,"BITMAIN B3 ASIC miner has just been cracked and ported for NVIDIA GPU cards and apparently the 3 GTX1050 cards beat 1 BITMAIN B3 ASIC in performance.

The crack/port of the miner was done by the http://uupool.cn team. It appears that the miner used inside of the ASIC can do 300 H/s on a single GTX 1050 card.
So, 3 x GTX 1050 that currently cost ~500$ will produce 900 H/s and use only 210 W. Compared to the BITMAIN B3 ASIC 760 H/s for 360 W for ~3500$ (retail price at the moment of writing).

The miner is currently only usable under Linux and the setup can be done easily via the MinerOS
A complete guide on how to setup the miner and MinerOS can be found on the UU Pool site.

We have also provided an alternative download location in case the miner gets removed. BTM Miner NVIDIA

This development shines light on an interesting angle of ASICs. When people think of ASICs and their power, most assume that their mining advantage comes from the specifically designed ASIC chips they use. Apparently the miner software they use for the B3 has played a more important role compared to the chips. it certainly is interesting if such a crack/port of their miners is possible for the EQUIHASH and ETHASH ASICS. That would be one way GPU mining remains profitable.

One can say that the GPUs just stroked back at BITMAIN and their conquest to make an ASIC for every coin that exists. We will have to wait and see if BITMAIN will “fork” their ASICs and make them “GPU resistant”",1527665564,30/05/2018 07:32:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n6oh3/httpswwwcryptocoinznetbitmainb3minercrackedandport/,1

Bic Camera in Japan Stole my Bitcoin,"Hello,

I read a few posts and watched youtube videos in the last few months about more and more commerces now accepting Bitcoin.

As I am travelling to Japan right now, and looking for ways to spend my Bitcoin, I visited one Bic Camera store and made a purchase worth 0.031 BTC

The vendor provided me the address, I paid the Bitcoin with higher fees, the transaction was confirmed within 1-2 minutes. Yet he said the money wasn't received on their part. He told me I will get reimbursed and to come back the next day to buy the product.

Then I received an email from BitFlyer telling me they will reimburse me the money as soon as they confirm it was received on their part. By that time, the transaction was already confirmed hundreds times on the blockchain, and the Address I sent it to already spent it. They asked me to create an account on BitFlyer so I can get my money back. I did create an account on their website. Then one week later they write to me, telling me they can confirm they received my money, but it will take time to get my reimbursement. Now it's been three weeks and haven't received a word from them.

I am very pissed by this. They just took me 300 dollars worth of bitcoin and claimed the transaction never happenned. Bic Camera do not want to deal with the issue as they pretend I am not their customer. I do not care what process they use behind the counter nor what exchange they deal with. They advertise they accept Bitcoin and yet whoever is in charge of the address they gave to me stole my money.

The problem isn't with Bitcoin per say. The problem is 'regulated' or 'official' companies that pretend to accept bitcoin but in the end fraud its customers. As my BTC is already lost and I still have no access to customer support, I have nowhere to let people know about the fraud, except here.

So there it is. I don't know what to do, except rent here and let you guys know the experience is not always positive. They stole my money.",1527665716,30/05/2018 07:35:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n6ox0/bic_camera_in_japan_stole_my_bitcoin/,1
The price of Bitcoin shouldn't matter,"Hello! LTL FTP etc. etc. I will post this to /r/btc (I neither agree not disagree at this time with the politics between the two subreddits)

Firstly, I agree that people would want their portfolio to increase, help them become wealthier etc. but if we all focusses on adoption rather than Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency's price), we would push for this technology to be used properly. If the price of Bitcoin rises/falls in that process, it shouldn't matter. We should be focussing on what we, as a community can do to make crypto used in everyday life and not just as a 'stock'

Storing BTC long term,"Hello there,

I'm in a bit of a conondrum here, for the moment I'm using an electrum Wallet with a legacy adress \(starting with a 1\) and use it as a long term storage.

I'm getting to the point were I need to up my security level and I've purchased a Ledger Nano S \(directly from them on their website and not on amazon\). From now on I would like to send new BTC to my ledger Nano S wallet. And will maybe consolidate the BTC by sending all the BTC from my Electrum Wallet to the ledger Nano S wallet if it's a good idea.

I haven't setup yet my new HW wallet and I would like to know what do you think I should do:

1\) still use a legacy format on the ledger \(is it even possible?\) ?

2\) use another format \(Segwit compatible or something else\) ?

My train of though when I first setup my Electrum wallet was that if, in the future, there was a fork\+airdrop that would become the majority, I would be able to continue on it and keep my balance. with Segwit there is no airdrop. Thus I've used the old legacy format.

I am a bit paranoid, so even if there were new forks that came out since I've setup my electrum wallet, I haven't used my private key in any other wallet to do so. I'm afraid that even if I transfer my coin first to a new wallet, the old wallet will then be compromise and later be used by someone else to claim the airdrop to yet another future fork. Thus I'm only willing to claim an airdrop only if BTC is dead and and another fork survive.

What type of adress format are you using for long term storage with a HW wallet and why?",1527666771,30/05/2018 07:52:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n6rp3/storing_btc_long_term/,1

Locked wallets on exchanges?,"Exchanges will sometimes lock their users wallets resulting a lot of angry people that can’t access or transfer their funds. Wallets may appear to be ‘under maintenance’ with little explanation about why or for how long. This can occur during shifts in the market when users are most looking to transfer funds. At best, this is poor customer service and public relations. At worst, this is the exact type of issue around centralized control that crypto was aiming to circumvent.    


Will these practices stop over time as exchanges mature?  
Are practices like this pushing users towards decentralized options instead?  
Should we expect regulators try to force exchanges to enact different practices?",1527668477,30/05/2018 08:21:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n6w94/locked_wallets_on_exchanges/,1

WCO examines 'immutable blockchain' technology,"""The WCO Report also advocates for Customs to avail of the potential offered by new technologies such as blockchains, and the third and final session of the Conference explored the possibilities and potential limitations of the application of the new technology. A representative from the Institute for Austrian and International Tax Law, Vienna University of Economics and Business acknowledged that the WCO was one of the only international organisations seriously examining blockchains, and presented an overview of the principle features of the technology; the fact that it allows for the creation of immutable records and the decentralization and distribution of ledgers, in addition to a potential increase in transparency, would make it a very attractive option for Customs administrations, particularly those wishing to engage in information sharing with other agencies such as Tax administrations. A representative of Delft University of Technology outlined the principle features and benefits of a pilot project undertaken in the Netherlands by Maersk, IBM and with the cooperation of Dutch Customs; an example of cooperation and collaboration across industries and agencies, which enabled all stakeholders to leverage knowledge from the supply chain. All panelists agreed on the importance for the WCO and Customs to keep abreast of the changes in the rapidly\-evolving technological realm. ""

Dựa vào các thuộc tính khác nhau của các loại tiền điện tử, Huobi Pro đã phân loại chúng thành 4 loại là: ""Tiền"", ""Nền tảng"", ""Ứng dụng"" và ""Mã thông báo tài sản"". Theo đó, số lượng các thành phần được chọn trong 4 loại này dựa trên lượng giao dịch của chúng trong quý trước. Sau khi phân bổ được các thành phần vào từng loại thích hợp, khối lượng giao dịch trung bình hàng ngày tại quý trước sẽ được sử dụng để quyết định khối lượng thành phần của chỉ số. Huobi cũng lên kế hoạch để khởi động các sản phẩm dựa trên chỉ số này với chỉ số chính của nó như là một mục tiêu giám sát tại Huobi Pro vào ngày 10 tháng 6 tới đây.

Được ra mắt với 1,000 điểm cơ sở, chỉ số Huobi 10 sẽ được phát hành tới các cơ quan truyền thông tài chính toàn cầu như Bloomberg vào một ngày nào đó sau này. Trong các hệ thống cũng đã có những kế hoạch lớn được thiết kế riêng cho chỉ số Huobi 10. 

Theo như tiến độ làm việc được tính toán tháng 6 năm 2018, Huobi Group sẽ cho ra mắt một sản phẩm tài chính là HB10, được đưa ra dựa trên Chỉ số Huobi 10. Cũng theo đó, các dẫn xuất tài chính trong tương lai dự kiến sẽ được phát hành dựa trên Chỉ số Huobi 10. Cơ sở cho nhận định này dựa trên những đặc tính sau đây của Huobi 10:

· Hiệu suất \(thị trường\) cao:

Chỉ số Huobi 10 thể hiện rất tốt so với Bitcoin \(BTC\). Theo như những số liệu được ghi lại từ tháng 3 đến tháng 5, trong giai đoạn Alpha giá trị của Huobi 10 so với BTC là 0.0028, và sau đó khi tiến đến giai đoạn Belta giá trị của Huobi 10so với BTC là 0.79. Điều này chứng minh rằng chỉ số Huobi 10 có hiệu quả trong hạn chế sự biến động. 

· Thị trường bước vào giai đoạn chín muồi:

Sự ra đời của một chỉ số tài chính là dấu hiệu của việc thị trường đã đạt tới được quy mô của nó và đang bước vào giai đoạn chín muồi. Ví dụ như, các chỉ số S&amp;P500 và MSCI đã trở thành các chỉ số chuẩn được sử dụng bởi các nhà quản lý danh mục đầu tư hàng đầu. Chỉ số Huobi 10 là một chỉ số toàn diện gồm có một số lượng lớn các tài sản kỹ thuật số. Và chỉ số này được hình thành dựa trên việc sử dụng các công nghệ mang tầm thế giới tương tự như các phương pháp chỉ số tổng hợp truyền thống.

Là một trong những sàn giao dịch tiền điện tử hàng đầu thế giới, Huobi thông qua nền tảng platform của mình luôn luôn hướng tới việc cung cấp cho các nhà giao dịch tiền điện tử trên toàn thế giới khả năng truy cập và khai thác hơn 100 tài sản kỹ thuật số. Với việc phát hành chỉ số Huobi 10 mới này, Huobi hướng tới một loại chỉ số thị trường mới, cốt lõi và có tầm ảnh hưởng tới cả thị trường.

Cryptocurrency That Makes Sense..!!,"With the recent rise in cryptocurrencies, the main drive is to speculate on their value. Bitcoin, for example, has become less of a currency and more a commodity. Its value fluctuates as the cryptocurrency bubble is growing up to the point of breaking.

For cryptocurrencies to make any sense, it is necessary to bring them out into a viable and credible marketplace. There was Silk Road, which for better or worse provided the ultimate proof of cryptocurrencies’ safety and inherent anonymity. But what about other, more noble uses?
There is a new platform called On.Live. A platform that utilizes its own form of cryptocurrency — the On.Live token. The services offered via the platform are all focused on live streaming and broadcasting of valuable content via a participant — based network.

There are many revenue-generating roles for On.Live platform users. One does not have to provide exclusive content to create an income stream. As this is a true online broadcasting marketplace, there are various services to provide and make money on:

Broadcaster — perhaps the most self-explanatory role, broadcaster produces and broadcasts the content over the network.

Service provider — a more diverse position for anyone who has a skill that he or she can sell via our system and create private offers.

Transcoder — Transcoder simply transcodes the broadcasting stream into other formats. the transcoder can also perform the duties of a Relay Node.

Relay Node — transmits the stream to recipients without transcoding it.

The Recipient — finally there is the Recipient who watches the stream and buys services or content.

Within an open environment provided by On.Live, anyone can play a role that best suits their technical abilities and particular skillsets. Furthermore, this system is so versatile that virtually anyone with access to the internet may become a user. This applies not just to individuals, but also to companies, be it small businesses or large enterprises — even TV stations and advertising networks. This is indeed a huge step in creating a truly free and diverse online broadcasting marketplace.

All these roles generate money in form of a cryptocurrency — On.Live tokens.

On.Live uses blockchain to control transactions and settlements (tokens) and it has its own platform for real-time communication, trading and dealings. ONL token is an integral element of the On.Live Platform. It is used as a fee currency for transmission and transcoding services to incentivize decentralized computing required for the video broadcasts. Furthermore, it is the only payment option on the platform.

As with other currencies, the ONL token is limited in number to 111,000,000 and right now, they are offered at a substantial and rather attractive discount of 30% as the platform goes into a pre ICO phase. This will provide ONL tokens’ users with ability to invest into a new form of cryptocurrency, with its own marketplace and intended use. All of which will precipitate the value of this altcoin to go only up.

While the bubble on Bitcoin may be about to burst, there is a place for other virtual currencies which are more attractive as a form of investment, be it because of their security or substantial technical differences to the Bitcoin vehicle.

But whatever their attractiveness may stem from, the ONL token is unique in a way that it comes with a ready-made range of services and products that can be realistically bought via On.Live platform. For the first time, users can earn cryptocurrency by fulfilling a realistic role within the system.

It is safe to say this is the perfect moment to get onboard with investing in virtual currency — more affordable than most, and certainly safer from volatile market speculations, On.Live may prove to be the one investment opportunity that makes perfect sense for a long-term investment in something that is valuable on many levels.",1527673301,30/05/2018 09:41:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n799s/cryptocurrency_that_makes_sense/,1

"What may be the impact of a ""new"" financial crisis in the EU (Italy) on Bitcoin and Crypto in general?","Because of the situation in Italy, I believe that there is a high probability that the Euro-Zone is near to a new and much more serious Euro- and banking-crisis than in the past (because of smaller countries like Cyprus and Greece). 

It's very hard to estimate which scenario will realize but at the moment I don't see any realistic ""solution"" (or what the EU would try to call a solution, actually they've always just bought time) that would not lead into some kind of escalation. 

The situation in short is this (articles below): People in Italy have voted for parties that are very critical about the EU and the EURO. The winning parties tried to form the new government, but got rejected by the President (Italien President has a different function than the US-President) because of only one personality. 

Most realistic scenario right now seems to be: New Elections, most likely in just a few months (probably September) and Italians are unlikely to vote less extreme the next time, but the other way around. In that case the winning party/parties will demand a lot what the EU/other EU countries like Germany (I'm german btw) would have to reject because 1) it would be very expensive and 2) other countries would want the same, 3) it would be the opposite of what was preached in Greece and other countries. 

At the same time the Italien negotiation-position is strong, they have a lot they can threat with. In case they would leave the EURO it would in fact be a bankruptcy with huge impact especially on Frech Banks, but not only. It would have damaging impact on the whole financial system, on the economy, on other EU-states and it very well may turn out as the end of the EURO. I don't consider that as the most likely scenario. It would be an extreme, but it's not impossible. At the same time the whole situation is like a trap without much options that would not lead into some kind of escalation. The only non-escalating-scenario would probably be if people in Italy would vote ""EU-conform"", which is very unlikely.

***********
Bitcoin was started shortly after the financial crisis which realized after the Lehman-break-down in 2008. I believe what is likely to come will, if it comes, will turn out as much much harder and have much more impact. 

So, my question: If we imagine that an escalation which would lead into a financial crisis, maybe even a breakdown of the EURO, seems possible or even likely:

- What kind of impact may it have on Bitcoin and Crypto in general? 
- Some, probably a majority, believe that Bitcoin would be seen as virtual gold, an asset to flee in. 
- Others believe, that if financial markets suffer, Bitcoin may also suffer. 

What would be interesting: To know what Italians think about the situation, since they may have more ability to predict the direction of the situation in Italy. 

I believe that it doesn't necessarily need an ""or"" between Option 1 and 2, that it would be more a question of weighting. But under the line I tend to option 1. 

***********

These are the 2 most important applications to help bitcoin be used as money IMO,"1) lending. What is a world without credit. We need a decentralized network for p2p lending in bitcoin. Something that allows people to safely loan out their money while reducing defaukt risk in a way where the interest rate is set by the free market.

2) some form of recurring payment or direct debit mechanism. An automated way to send someone a pre-determined amount of bitcoin automatically on pre-set date.

These two functions are absolutely necessary if people are ever going to use bitcoin over banks. 

I know they will emerge eventually, in the meantime does anyone know of any info regarding this type of functionality being built today?",1527687050,30/05/2018 13:30:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n8kzv/these_are_the_2_most_important_applications_to/,1

PSA: Don't buy 2nd hand gift cards,"I run an ecommerce website and we've seen a lot of fraudulent orders come in and buying gift cards. We notice the fraud orders and cancel all the gift cards and return the cash back to the credit card holder.

Well it seems the thief will then list these gift cards on sketchy bitcoin markets like Bitify. 

Sadly, someone bought one of these gift cards and got burned. So if a gift card looks too good to be true; it is. If it's not directly from the source, or a physical product; it's probably fake.

A one-time stock brokers approach to Bitcoin (Core).,"i have been a Bitcoin \(Core\) holder for a number of years. I've seen sites come and go but have yet to lose any of my satoshi in any site or wallet I've been a part of. From what I have seen Bitcoin \(Core\) is no more than a very volatile money market fund. I have a debit card which I can use to convert Bitcoin in fiat currency and pay mostly anywhere at will. Is this really any different than a debit card accessing funds in a account which happens to be based in U.S. dollars? Would you not all agree that all our markets are manipulated by events, computers , pundits and hackers? I believe that the vast majority of alt\-coins will flow into eventual obscurity, But, like most originals, I feel Bitcoin \(Core\) will survive and prosper.

Trying to create a online marketplace fully centered upon cryptocurrency transactions.,"I think a key obstacle in bitcoin or crypto adoption is the lack of its usage for everyday transactions.

 Even buying simple goods with crypto is challenging because no one accepts it.

Perhaps an online marketplace, \(**For now limited to crypto enthusiasts like members of this forum**\), could serve as an experimental project in validating bitcoins transactional ability.

I am a programmer at a large blockchain startup so building it will be no problem, but I still want feedback from fellow crypto advocates. 

Could a marketplace for crypto users to transact with other crypto users help the ecosystem? Not a business idea, but more so an experiment in helping crypto usage grow.

Thanks guys.",1527694494,30/05/2018 15:34:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n9j79/trying_to_create_a_online_marketplace_fully/,1
Some questions about bitcoin,"Ola pipl.

I'm a writer and decided to get into this blockchain thingy so I'm learning from some books and online courses about the technical aspects of this whole thing but of course not all of it perfectly clear. When I *buy* bitcoin, where do i buy it from? Seriously, I just don't get it, I registered on coinbase, bought coins for a few k and can't figure out \- where did I buy it from? If I buy, someone/something has to sell them, right? So who sold those coins to me and is it possible that I will decide to buy \(in theory\) 1m coins and won't be able to because there is not enough *someones* selling this amount of coins at this moment?

On top of that, bitcoins stored in your wallet as *cash,* so that different transactions basically don't combine:

Mark sent Eric 2 BTC. Then Eric sent back to Mark 0.5 BTC. Which breaks whole 2 into 1.5 and 0.5. If we split our bills into smaller and smaller coins, does it mean that at some point in the future there will be no bills at all and only coins of very little value?

I believe it doesn't really matter in general, but I'm confused why does it work that way? Why if I receive 0.2 and 0.2BTC it will stay separate in my wallet and never combine. Is there an important reason for it to be that way which I missed?

If you are lazy and want to reply with a link \- that will do!",1527694597,30/05/2018 15:36:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8n9jqu/some_questions_about_bitcoin/,1

"Coin selection strategy for ""active"" (services/exchanges) wallets","Hello,
I am looking for a coin selection strategy for ""active"" (services/exchanges) wallets.

I have checked a [Mark Erhardt papir](http://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf). It was adopted in [bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp). 

I have also checked some go-btcsuite approaches [1, 2]. They look easier.

But are all these strategies suitable for ""active"" wallets? As I understand it, they can not afford to wait change from previous transactions and should always keep some available unspent outputs. Do my concerns make sense? Or maybe there is another way to organize an ""active"" wallet.

Thanks!

A Scary Thought,"I'm from Surat city, you might not have heard of it, it's the biggest city on the top fastest developing cities of the world, it has the biggest textile market in asia and 11/12 diamonds in the world are polished in diamond sweatshops here. Basically there's a lot of corruption money here, which lead to some shrewd corrupt people to start bitcoin brands and schemes to lure other corrupt people from the general public to hide/transfer/convert their black money \(especially in the days after the demonetization thing the indian govt. did\). There have been stories of even corrupt cops extorting btc from corrupt builders and what not. I am even ashamed to have worked in an ad agency that had once such bitcoin\-clone brand, sigh, i even wrote some videos and social media posts for them. Anyway...the scare thought is this \- what if tomorrow a corrupt government decides to make it illegal to have bitcoin and not declare them. Of course people know/will\-know that it's not entirely anonymous. Anyway, so they either find a bunch of people holding/transacting coins of whatever amount, or a bunch of people declare they do, the govt. goes to them and asks ""what's the value of your coins in the national fiat currency?"". If the guy thinks it is better to answer very low like $1/BTC, the govt may say, ""well here's $10 for your 10 BTC, transfer them to us now"". If the guy thinks it's better to overinflate and say $10k/BTC then the govt. can say well then ""here's the tax bill for your $100k assets, pay it now"". Can this happen? It certainly can happen in a corrupt country like india.

The Government STOLE 11 Bitcoins From Me!,"Back in July last year I had a flourishing business selling all sorts of drugs on AlphaBay. After a night of good partying with girls, alcohol, and ecstasy I logged onto my vendor account to see the servers were down and so was the website. I had saved up a little less than 11 coins in a few months of work and the government stole it all because what I was doing was ""illegal."" For me, I was running a business selling drugs to people willling to buy. Not the best business in the world for your conscious but the money is good.

I had to write this story because I saw the other guy complaining about the store stealing his $300. At least you can shoot the guy. In my case there is nothing I can do unless I want to take on an army which I am not prepared to do yet. Try working everyday for 15 hour days and losing everything you earned. Not going to lie though. I didn't care. Bitcoin is a great way to store funds and not let anyone steal from you ever. For this reason I am all in.

I see a lot of people talking about things that if they did this right there would never be a problem. You can start a bitcoin wallet never attached to your identity and your money be 100% anonymous and never pay any of these thieving governments taxes if you don't want to. We don't want bitcoin to be more regulated and transparent. That just makes it easier to steal the hard earned money you worked for. Just wanted to say these few things to get your brains turning. Love me or hate me I'm still free tax free and enjoying the benefits of bitcoin the way its supposed to be.",1527710253,30/05/2018 19:57:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nbou0/the_government_stole_11_bitcoins_from_me/,1

I run a small law office -- had my first Bitcoin paying client today.,"I run a small law practice. I do mostly Estate Planning (wills, trusts, &amp; probate) and Evictions (oddball side of the practice that grew out of the probate side but is now about 35% of my business).

At the end of most client meetings I ask: ""How do you want to pay me?""

Clients will often reply: ""What will you take?""

I always answer (in a light-hearted way): ""I'm a lawyer, I'll take anything...cash, check, card... I'll even take BitCoin."" (This gets a chuckle out of most clients).

Today, the client said: ""You take bitcoin?"" 

And after printing my public key code, client transferred fee via bitcoin.

Took about 30 seconds to show up as pending, that was good enough for me. We finished up meeting and client left office.

I hope client ""spends and replaces"" because that might become my largest fee I've ever gotten in 10 years, but in the meantime, I'm just happy to put it to real use!

Abusive Bitcoin Trademark Registrations,"There was a Reddit post a couple of days before about someone registering ""Bitcoin"" as a trademark and sending a cease and desist letter.

That particular trademark was registered in the UK, dated 13 April 2018. It covers class 25 (clothing), class 32 (beverages) and class 33 (wine).

A search for EU trademarks shows more results.

One is the trademark originally filed in 2011 by MtGox and now owned by the Japanese exchange ""Bitflyer"".  This trademark covers: Software for commerce over a global communications network. Electronic commerce services, namely providing information about products via telecommunication networks for advertising and sales purposes. Signal transmission for electronic commerce via telecommunication systems and data communication systems. Constructing an internet platform for electronic commerce.

Another recent example is a trademark ""Bitcoin"" registered on April 4th of this year for group 30, which is for all sorts of candy.

In contrast, if you search with ""Google"" or ""Coca-Cola"", you will find no trademarks registered by third parties for clothing or wine.

That's because if anyone attempts to register such a trademark, Google or Coca-Cola will oppose the registration and stop it under Article 8 Paragraph 5 of the trademark Regulation 2017/1001. This prevents registration of a trademark that is identical to another trademark that ""has a reputation in the Union"".

There are two reasons for this.

One is that it would be unfair to Google if anybody could just go ahead and dilute their trademark.

The other is that it would be unfair to give anyone an exclusive right to a valuable name when they had no part in the effort to create the value in the first place.

With Bitcoin, the first aspect doesn't come into play. By design, there is no entity like Google owning the name Bitcoin. That also means that there is nobody who can oppose registration of a ""Bitcoin"" trademark for candy.

But the second aspect is valid with Bitcoin as well. The German company Katjes, which has registered the Bitcoin candy EU trademark, had no part in the effort needed to develop Bitcoin to a $125 billion marketcap at the time of this writing. They are free-riding on the efforts of others.

Which would not be a big problem if they didn't attempt to create an exclusive right for themselves. This is not possible with copyright. The open source license Bitcoin is built on makes sure that no one involved can claim any exclusive copyright on Bitcoin software. It is also not possible with patents. If you try to patent the concept of ""proof of work"", you should be blocked from doing so by the simple fact that this concept is public knowledge since January 3rd 2009.

I think there should some way to stop people from registering copyrights for Bitcoin candy and free-riding on the good will created by others.

But I don't see any such way in the existing Regulation.

The closest parallel I could find would be the absolute ground for registration refusal in Article 7 Paragraph 1 (h), which stops people from registering a trademark ""Germany"" for candy, or the colors of the German flag.

Just like Bitcoin, this is just a public interest. And just like Bitcoin, candy makers should be stopped from creating an exclusive right in a word (Germany) that has achieved fame based on something different from their own efforts.

However, there is no such ground for refusal right now for ""Bitcoin"".

That means two things.

For one, every immoral actor around can race other  sleazy scumbags to get a piece of the action. There are lots of goods where using the famous ""Bitcoin"" phrase might make sense for marketing purposes. Whoever gets his registration first will profit from the fame created by others.

And in the longer term, the Regulation should be changed and terms that ""have a reputation in the Union"" should be off limits for registration, even if there is no trademark owner of them.

Unable to access/see my coins," Hey guys,   
 

So feb 2014 i bought into bitcoins. I just put a small sum of money in,  and then the market crashed and I kind of just forgot about it.  
 

I've changed computers since then too, so I don't have the wallet  program I was using. I do however have the .dat file \- is this enough to  get my coins back? I believe i had quark coin and the normal bitcoin.  
 

I've downloaded bitcoin core after reading this article:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6pfher/newbie\_question\_how\_can\_i\_open\_an\_old\_walletdat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6pfher/newbie_question_how_can_i_open_an_old_walletdat/)  


  
 Spent about 5 days with my PC on syncing it up, then put the wallet file  in the directory \(and renamed it wallet.dat\) however it says i have 0  coins. It did, however, load a previous transaction from 2014 saying i  purchased coins.   
 

Is this something to do with the bitcoin cash thing? Is it something to  do with some of my coins being quark coins too? I'm pretty out of the  loop with this stuff, help would be much appreciated!

Technical Question: What if a peer goes offline?,"Hi, I'm new to this subreddit (and reddit in general), so if I break some internet rule that I don't know about please lmk.

Despite my naiveté in old forums, I'm attempting to create my own cryptocurrency with a twist (mostly for fun).

QUESTION: What if a peer goes offline and does not receive a block? Won't they be out of the loop, unable to match their previous hash with the headers of new incoming blocks? How do they ""catchup"" without miners having to send the entire blockchain every time they add a new block?

You can assume I know most of the technical protocols of how cryptocurrencies work, I'm just confused by this aspect. Thanks!!!",1527741089,31/05/2018 04:31:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nfd5p/technical_question_what_if_a_peer_goes_offline/,1

China is getting friendlier towards crypto. The market is getting greener amid the news.,"Crypto market has demonstrated an increasing in prices amid a significant change in opinion from eastern countries that could alter the future course of the cryptocurrency. 
The bump in price happened right after China’s president Xi Jinping endorsed the potential that blockchain technology has to global economies.   💬“Ever since the start of the 21st century, a new generation of industrial revolution is substantially reshaping the global economic structure with artificial intelligence, internet of things and blockchain constantly making application breakthroughs,” – he said in his speech. 
 

The Chinese president went on to say he will open national laboratories to research and develop blockchain infrastructure to better prepare the nation for the future. 
🇨🇳China has the strictest regulation and control over cryptocurrencies but the recent endorsement from the President highlights a shift in opinion.

I have no where else to turn,"I'm writing to you today with great humility and embarrassment. Friends, I need your help.

Last year, when I signed up for insurance on the marketplace, I estimated my income at the minimum qualifying level, and set a goal to make enough money each month so that I would be sure to qualify for health insurance. However, things didn't go as planned, and my health was so erratic that I was unable to make even that minimum.

In 2017 I was recovering from major surgery. I was completing a pain management program; 4 hours of daily therapy, five days a week, for six weeks. It was constant physical, water, pelvic and mental health therapies. It was bone spurs irritating nerves around my rib cage. It was 2 pinched nerves in my low back, sending neuralgia radiating down my leg, making sitting impossible. This was followed by repeated steroid epidurals that provided tiny pockets of pain-free time. In the meantime, my chronic illnesses crept in on me and flared because of the stress - more pain from endometriosis and increased anxiety and depression.

I worked when I could, thanks to friends who offered me flexible jobs that I could do in the pockets of wellness. Even with their generosity, most months I fell well short of my income goal. Being unable to sit was challenging and when I fell back on restaurant work, I found my single-sided deafness too great to be able to communicate effectively with guests or co-workers. It seemed everything I did to advocate for myself blew up in my face. As the year kept on, the stress from this continued to eat me from the inside out, paralyzing me with fear and self-disgust.

It was and still is my intention to become fully employed by eventually getting enough small jobs that are flexible so that I can be fully self-sufficient. 

I went five years without health insurance and health care. The last three have been a blessing and I am so grateful to have the wonderful, affordable plan I have. I have been working diligently to improve my health and I have made so much progress.

Thanks to my excellent health insurance, I'm going to therapy twice a week, and with the help of experts, have an intensive at-home physical therapy and relaxation routine to help manage pain and neuralgia. I've been experimenting with new medications, and though I had a couple of bad reactions that set me back, I've recently found something new that's promising. I have discovered that St. Louis has an endometriosis specialist who is in my network, and one of my goals for 2018 is to see him and have expert excision surgery that is not available in Fort Collins. 80% of his patients have no recurrence and the idea of not being in pain 75% of each month seems fantastical. Also, I have been testing bone assisted hearing devices and would like to go through with a surgery that would implant an abutment in my skull for the device to attach. During the trial, being able to hear, I've felt like I've been let in on a little secret. It's difficult to explain to those who haven't experienced it, but, not having to constantly position myself to hear, read lips, strain and eventually checking out and isolating myself from others has really made a difference. The lack of frustration must be self-evident, but, what is amazing to me is that I don't wear out so fast. I don't come home from a single outing exhausted with a 3 day recovery. I had no idea how much energy I was using simply existing in the presence of others. At this point, my insurance company has denied this procedure but my audiologist and her team are busy working on an appeal on my behalf. I am so grateful.

I am doing everything I can to make my life better and to be a functioning member of society but I've fallen into one of the holes in the system. My income from 2017 is too low for me to qualify for healthcare in 2018. This means I will lose my insurance with providers I know and trust, my plans will be entirely derailed and progress lost.

I can't lose my health insurance.

I can't lose this momentum.

I've come too far.

I need your help.

I know it's a lot to ask and it seems an impossible amount and this is one of the most embarrassing things I've had to do. 

I have about three weeks to raise $8,000. It sounds impossible, but some close friends have indicated their willingness to help, and that's given me the courage to ask. I'm doing this as a last resort. I humbly ask for the help of those who can. I know things are tight for most of us. Would you please consider donating? 

BTC: 1CFeoAzPefqK9Q1gvFKssY4HDFvtpkjtCC

Please keep any money you need.

Money raised will be used for:

-Most importantly, qualifying for 2018 insurance
-Living expenses
-Health insurance and medical costs, including travel to St. Louis for endometriosis treatment
-Non-covered medical expenses: dentist, audiologist, alternative pain practitioner, optometrist, contacts, progressive lenses
-Possibly, supportive seating that does not trigger nerve pain

Thank you, friends, for your consideration and for supporting my mission to wellness and full-functionality.

Love,
Whitney

P.S. I welcome any suggestions you may have for flexible paid work in 2018. I don't want to find myself in this situation again. I am available for pet sitting, nail care, house sitting, child care, cleaning and organization, light bookkeeping, administrative tasks, and research projects. I would love to assist a creative and am open to random opportunities.

Thank you for your time.",1527747421,31/05/2018 06:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ng4w8/i_have_no_where_else_to_turn/,1

Why crypto wins,"So the other day I was helping a friend learn about bitcoin because he wanted to play online poker. 

I explained he needed to open a gemini account and link his bank. He was exited. Went through the steps. Then got a notice that the bank account number was wrong. He goes down to the bank and they tell him they don’t put account numbers on outgoing wire transfers. So now he’s out the $100 for 3-5 days while his money sits in banking limbo. Oh and they charged him $30 on top of the $100 so that he has the luxury to have his money frozen for a while.  He still can’t get registered with gemini and all he wanted to do was deposit $50 into an online poker site for a little fun. 

So finally he gives me $100 cash. I give him the bitcoin on his phone standing next to gun. Done and done in under 10 seconds. A few minutes later the $100 worth of BTC was worth $102. 

Frictionless. Easy. Fast.  No hassle. No forms to fill out. Etc. 

Banks and traditional systems are simply archaic by comparison when it comes to simply moving money electronically. 

I can’t imagine any kids growing up today will look fondly at the slow and innefucient and intrusive banking system and then compare that o cryptocurrnecies and feel that traditional banking systems are anything but old fashioned dinosaurs like rotary phones and paying for long distance compared to smartphones w/ Skype. 

Banks simply cost more and do less with greater hassle.

Question about full nodes,"Good morning /r/Bitcoin 

I'm currently downloading the full bitcoin blockchain through bitcoin core.

Though my main problem is that it's painfully slow. 
I've downloaded 140 GB  already **BUT** I've noticed that I have no peers to connect to. I have 2 peers connected to and that's it. It's trying to connect to other ones but fails and retries every 30-40 seconds or so.

I am forced to download the whole blockchain through a .torrent file.

So the main question:

Am I the only one facing this problem ? CPU / RAM are on 10 % usage and my hdd isn't really doing much. My bandwidth is a few kb/s

Where's the scam?,"I'm fairly well know in some Telegram's group about crypto, so it's quite normal for me to receive questions and requests for help about Bitcoin. Few days ago a random guy ask me if I can sell to him something like 50btc and he want to pay in cash. This request sounds weird to me for so many reasons but I can't understand where's the scam.
So this guy asked me to meet in the city where I live, that's in fact quite big, and police is almost everywhere so it would make no sense trying to rob me  or doing something even more stupid.
That seems suspicious, because he could just have used websites like localbitcoins instead of getting in touch with random strangers via telegram.
But if he wanted to scam me he would have asked to buy a smaller number of bitcoins and buying It with PayPal instead of cash.

The owner of the messaging app telegram posted something on twitter about issues with the app and apple, along with this they tweeting a link to a post they'd supposedly written on telegra.ph stating sorry for all the issues but we are giving away bitcoin, send some to get more back, website looked legit, nothing posted on a quick search showing it was anything dodgy

\(Now in hindsight \- this seems scammy \- but it was posted by an official \(compromised\) twitter account. I haven't felt this low in a long time, am not really thinking straight, and $4000 would clear all my current money woes\)

So the idiot I am, I obtained $400 of bitcoin using the majority of the last bit of money I have, and sent it.

I feel numb, what an idiot!!

Any idea what I can do?

Bech32 Paper Wallet Generator,"https://kimbatt.github.io/btc-address-generator/  
  
I couldn't find a paper wallet generator with bech32 support, so I made one!  
This site supports generating bech32 segwit, ""regular"" p2sh-segwit, and legacy (p2pkh) addresses.  
You can also generate and print paper wallets, with many different styles.  
The entire page is a single html file, so it can be saved easily for offline address generation.  
The full source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Kimbatt/btc-address-generator).  
Also, if anyone has an idea for a fancy website name (instead of this github one), feel free to share it! (I couldn't think of one :D )",1527773504,31/05/2018 13:31:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8nifhd/bech32_paper_wallet_generator/,1

A few questions about lost bitcoin / potential second layers (loss-proof BTC and the like),"A simple google search yields the result that somewhere between 2.78 and 3.79 million BTC have been lost for good. My question to this point is, ""Shouldn't this make the present price / value of bitcoin higher than it already is? Is there a second layer that can be created by the community that corrects the price to be more accurately reflected?""      

And my second question is, since human error is rampant, would it be possible to create a second layer that acts as a ""safety net"" to reverse a transaction to a wallet owner who accidentally sends bitcoin to a non-existent wallet address?

double spending question,"hey all

i got a question

people still wait for 6 confirmations when sending and receiving large amounts. 

Scenario :



current fee for a transaction to be taken up in 

the next 5 blocks  :   200 sat/byte

the next 10 blocks   :  100 sat/byte

the next 25 blocks  :  10 sat/byte



I send some bitcoins to address ""A"", with the fee of 10 sat/byte

the transaction enters the mempool and starts spreading through the network, waiting to be picked up by a miner.

while its taking time to get picked up, i try submitting another transaction using the same unspent TX output to another address, ""B"".

hence, trying to spend the same bitcoins again, this time including a fee of 1000 sat/byte.

i am confused as what happens at this point.

* does my latter transaction get rejected by the network, because the same UTXO has been spent, though still in mempool.

if so, why do people still wait for 6 confirmations ? the transaction will get confirmed, sooner or later.

* does the latter transaction get picked up sooner, thus invalidating the first transaction ?

if so, why isn't the network programmed to reject such transactions and simplify things ?

** bonus question : is it possible for a transaction in the mempool, to get destroyed without getting included in a block ?
