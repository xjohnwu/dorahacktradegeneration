Backing up Wallet file,"I'm using a 2 of 3 multi sig wallet, using Electrum.  The three wallets are spread over my laptop, desktop and phone.  I'm planning to get an offline cold wallet with an air-gapped computer (and/or a hardware wallet) later.  I'm currently in the process of moving countries, so can't get that set up right away and will do it once I arrive.

I have my three wallets' mnemonics backed up on paper and want one level of backup extra if possible.

How (un)safe is it to backup the encrypted wallet files to a cloud storage?
  
I can backup each of the three wallets somewhere different each if needed.

As I understand the wallet files are encrypted - so are they safe to be backed up?

To get to the passwords for the wallet, someone will need to have a key-logger on two of the three machines.  Each wallet uses a different password.

I'm trying to avoid the risk of having my paper backups, and my devices all in one spot during the move and somehow losing all of it in one go and having no way of accessing my wallet addresses.

Once I have arrived in my new country, will I do a ""proper"" air gapped offline wallet for my main funds, with a smaller amount of funds in a ""hot"" wallet on my devices.",1538381060,01/10/2018 08:04:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kefr0/backing_up_wallet_file/,1

r/Bitcoin recap - September 2018,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I‚Äôm back with the 21st monthly Bitcoin news recap.


For those unfamiliar, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in bitcoin over the past month.


You can see recaps of the previous months on [Bitcoinsnippets.com](http://bitcoinsnippets.com/)

We‚Äôre getting ready to launch a Bitcoin cashier system and want to thank you guys for the answers in a post I made two years ago. You guys are awesome.,"TLDR: We‚Äôre launching our new baby. A Bitcoin Cashier system for websites with very easy integration. And would love to get some opinions on some of our processes.

Two years ago, I made a post about planning to build a wallet. Here‚Äôs a link to that post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4g46bf/need_some_help_with_an_online_wallet/

Thank you /u/frankenmint who took his time to give me straight answers. I believe you were instrumental in making us think about what we needed to achieve.

Well, we never built that wallet. But here‚Äôs where we are. 
After two years of programming and running back and forth, three software redesigns, lots of cursing, learning, errors, mistakes, murders and attempted assassinations, we‚Äôre finally getting to a product that we think and hope will help bitcoin adoption be much easier for websites whose owners are not technically inclined.

After having worked for a technical credit card processing company who uses i-frames to load their cashier onto a client‚Äôs website, I realized that if we were to provide websites with a way to accept bitcoin via an i-frame, we could be on to something. It had to be simple, copy and paste and the whole thing would just work. But it also had to be flexible enough for those who had some technical knowledge to add data to the i-frame code and be able to send variables like their user id and their transaction id as well as the currency they wanted to use for conversion viewing, we finally placed this setting in the database and the merchant can just set his own default conversion fiat currency.

With an i-frame, how do we avoid the third party cookie problem? Simple, no cookies, we don‚Äôt collect anything from the end user so there is no need for us to use cookies. The only thing we collect is the end user IP address and that is already collected by Apache, so we use it to help the merchant identify their buyer. I should mention, for anyone wondering, that other ways to identify the end user for the merchant are a combination of the amount, time of transaction, and bitcoin address that the end user pays to. Each address generated by the system is tied to the merchant so if ever someone sends bitcoin to that address, the merchant will be automatically credited those coins.

Autopay is a rather large script that is run every 60 seconds. It determines the amount of bitcoin that have reached 6 confirmations for each merchant or agent, then forwards the bitcoin to merchants if they have met the requirements.

After having looked at most of the available bitcoin cashier integrations out there, and seeing how utterly invasive they are, we believe we are offering something that is more akin to the bitcoin standards of privacy. We only require a name, email and phone number for the merchant sign up. The merchant should also provide us with three URLs, a website URL, a thank you page and an abandoned page where we forward their customers when and as needed. Yes, we do want to look at the website because we do not want to inadvertently aid someone selling kiddie porn or one of the cartels in Mexico who suddenly decide to sell drugs online via our site. And for anyone wondering, yes, we do list the Mexican Peso as a viewable currency.

Trustless system. This is something we have discussed at great length. We find ourselves in the middle of two camps here. We have found that in most cases, clients are not going to mind a system that briefly handles their coins to immediately forward them to their wallet. Think Shapeshift, which is immediate and other places who actually hold bitcoin for much longer times. Our goal is to keep the bitcoin server as devoid of bitcoin as we can. Constantly clearing it of bitcoin to avoid accumulation. Which is why we do not allow a merchant to begin unless they have input a bitcoin address where we can send them their bitcoin.

The other camp is to use a merchant‚Äôs wallet EXPUB to generate addresses so that we never touch the merchant‚Äôs bitcoin. This is a whole other animal, and we are working to implement this as we speak so that both camps on this issue can be served. This would entail the merchant depositing a certain amount of bitcoin to our servers where we may deduct the fees from as they perform transactions. At the moment, we believe that this service would be much more useful to bigger companies who have the know-how to work with a setup like this though we have no plans to limit this to just companies. We‚Äôre working on it and hope to be able to announce its implementation soon.

We‚Äôre also working on integrating Shapeshift so that we can offer merchants the ability to accept any coin in Shapeshift‚Äôs arsenal, and have those coins converted into bitcoin on the fly. This is going to happen much quicker. Like in the next couple of weeks.

We would love some feedback. And if you made it this far, thanks for reading!",1538412534,01/10/2018 16:48:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ki18q/were_getting_ready_to_launch_a_bitcoin_cashier/,1

How to prevent another blockchain overload like Q4 2017?,"We've just entered Q4 2018. In Q4 last year, a flood of new interest in Bitcoin led to a massively backlogged mempool, slow transactions, and very expensive transaction fees (up to $40). The traffic eventually subsided, but those problems became the talking points that competing chains like BCH use to portray BTC as crippled and broken.

Since them, BTC has seen slowly increasing amounts of segwit transactions, which will increase capacity a bit. However, the increase is marginal and a repeat of last year's transaction flood would likely lead to a similarly bogged-down and expensive BTC.

So - what is the plan to avoid a repeat of last year? LN is great but is not ready for the masses. Segwit adoption is steady but slow. Can we start talking about a hard-fork blocksize increase yet? I'm thinking the time for 4MB blocks has arrived.",1538420935,01/10/2018 19:08:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kjbbn/how_to_prevent_another_blockchain_overload_like/,1

Buying Bitcoin on Coinbase (without any fees),"  

**Buying Bitcoin without fees 101**

This guide will allow you to purchase any amount of BTC using Coinbase and Coinbase Pro with **absolutely no fees.** Basically you buy bitcoin with a limit order which makes you an order maker which results in no fees.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First, head over to Coinbase.com and register for an account. Enter in all your details and add a **bank account** (not credit/debit). 

There might be an option to add the bank account when you create the account, if not follow these steps

Go to settings. Then to linked accounts. Then click link new account. Sign in using your bank account info and it will automatically link it.

Next, head over to Coinbase Pro ([https://pro.coinbase.com](https://pro.coinbase.com/)). The reason for this separate site is to negate all fees that Coinbase imposes. It is some ridiculous percentage. Make an account at this website when you are signed into coinbase in a different tab. It should automatically link your accounts together. 

Now for the actual buying of the bitcoin. Go to regular Coinbase and click on accounts. You will see a USD Wallet option. Click deposit then choose your bank account and the amount of money you wish to deposit. Once you click deposit it will take around 3 business days to clear. You will know it has cleared by following these steps.

Go to accounts. Go to USD wallet and click withdraw. It will show the amount available funds to transfer and the amount that is waiting to clear. Once you see all your money available to transfer you know it has cleared.

Do not transfer this money on Coinbase, however. Go to the Coinbase Pro account we made earlier.  Go to trade( Shown below)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6b9x3ty2kmp11.png

&amp;#x200B;

After you select trade, click the deposit button on the left hand side and a box will pop up directing you to select your currency. Select USD. After that is selected this picture will appear. Choose **Coinbase Wallet** (Tab in the middle).

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/da96zjc4kmp11.png

After that is selected, enter the amount of money you wish to transfer from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro and hit deposit USD. You should receive the funds right away. Now it is time to buy the bitcoin with your funded USD. 

On the same sidebar that you see deposit and withdraw you will see buy/sell. Select buy then select **limit.** Limit is very important and is how you get around the bitcoin fees. You are now setting a buy order at a price you specify 



https://i.redd.it/c5bbo4d6kmp11.png

Enter the limit price as the middle price as you see in orange. 6718 is the same one as the arrow is pointing to. These numbers are constantly changing and it doesn‚Äôt have to be exact. You just want to buy at a price where it is eaten up instantly. Alter the number of bitcoin( I have .15) to whatever gets you closest to your desired amount of $. There will be a price indicator that you can‚Äôt see in that picture, below advanced, in the side tab to tell you how much USD worth of btc you are receiving. 

To send coins over stay on Coinbase Pro and go to my wallet( right hand side at the top). Under wallet overview (left side bar) choose BTC and scroll down in that sidebar and select withdraw. Then select the amount you wish to send and the address you wish. ",1538422023,01/10/2018 19:27:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kjh1r/buying_bitcoin_on_coinbase_without_any_fees/,1

The Blocks Satoshi Won,"Out of curiosity I was looking at the first blocks of bitcoin (block #1, #2, #3... #1,000)

Every  single bock sent the coinbase reward to a unique address. Are there any  theories as to why Satoshi did this? Satoshis coins are spread out over  literally thousands of different private keys. Seems unlikely that  these private keys were even being kept from the beginning

Any other thoughts or literature already out there on this?

Also, what block has the first ever bitcoin transaction in it? Was it Satoshi to Satoshi? Or Satoshi to Hal Finney?",1538422284,01/10/2018 19:31:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kjijl/the_blocks_satoshi_won/,1

I watch a lot of youtubers at work instead of listening to music, some of them are really good with comments analysis and predictions... some others, well let‚Äôs say i just run out of good youtubers and start watching shit about crypto.

Apart from Tone Vays (whom i know many despite) almost the rest is simply procrastinating their bullish predictions to get more viewers. Everyday the same shit: ETF is here, bullrun coming, mid 2018, late 2018 is always bullish and so on... Always the same sh*t.

Some of those posters i used to love them but as i learn more and more i realise they are fkin shillerz, they are just waiting and praying for the next bull run like your avg ignorant investor AND THAT IS SIMPLY WRONG! They are simply not helping, they are clowns!

I wrote this 9 page introduction to Bitcoin for friends who are intelligent and curious, but who don't want to commit to hours (years???) of going down the rabbit hole.  It covers: 1) 7 killer use cases for Bitcoin (largely focused on developing countries), 2) a deep dive on how Bitcoin actually works (everything from what is a blockchain to what is mining), and 3) how to get started buying, storing, and using your first bitcoin.

All feedback welcome. This is just the first of a few education/outreach efforts in the works, so stay tuned :)

Monthly Installment Plan Bitcoin Mining (and Accepts PayPal too)," I just started with FlyMining (Ethereum) and found the following Pros and Cons. What are your thoughts and experience?

Pros:  
\- Monthly installment payment with the option to convert to lifetime is available. Suitable for those who prefer to wait-and-see first before making a big commitment.  
\- Excellence tool to calculate forecast profit (with mining difficulty forecast)  
\- Bargain 1 year ETH contract at $7 per MH/s (not shown in public webpage). There is no maintenence fee / electricity fee for ETH contract

\- Accepts PayPal, which is convenient.  


Cons:

Here's my two cents regarding the upcoming Bullrun everyone is anticipating,"A bull-run will initiate this year, but unlike last year, it won't run its full course until after 1st quarter of 2019. Bitcoin will lead the charge and all other coins will follow, as expected. I believe one of the main drivers behind this run up will be due to BAAKT. The number of institutions participating in this new index will literally have no choice but to fill their inventory with Bitcoin before they are able to facilitate their services to the public.   There's no quiet way for institutions to load up on bitcoin without causing an overall increase in volume and ultimately price. Sure, they can stagger their buys to be less obvious, but overtime there will be an overall trend increase that will become undeniable. 

&amp;#x200B;

This increase in volume and price will inevitably generate FOMO in both individual investors, as well as your institutional ones. Despite having deep pockets, these corporations are no different then anyone else when it comes to trying to establish the highest profit margin possible. In other words, nobody is going to be sitting on the sidelines during the next run up. Especially when the world has seen just how high Bitcoin has already risen. Not to mention all of the prophetic-like price predictions placing bitcoin into the hundreds of thousands, even millions, in the distant future. Regardless of how improbable those projections may be; The fact of the matter is that there's no other coin right now that has a speculative ceiling higher than Bitcoin.   

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I do believe the on ramp for allowing institutions into the crpto space is currently being developed now (BAAKT). Its about six months away from being fully realized. Once active, it will allow significant amounts of new money into the crypto space from Institutional investors which will raise the overall total market cap; While simultaneously aiding in legitimization efforts via everyday use and acceptance of the coin across the general population, primarily within the western markets. This will be achieved by way of the various resulting partnerships and products (Starbucks, Microsoft, ETFs, etc...) that originate from that project.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know about anyone else but I can't wait to fast-forward to Jan 1 2019 to see where things are. Good  luck to everyone out there!...Ôªø ",1538452639,02/10/2018 03:57:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9knh9o/heres_my_two_cents_regarding_the_upcoming_bullrun/,1

Malta‚Äôs Prime Minister makes ‚Äòinevitable‚Äô bitcoin prediction,"I love Malta ‚Äì it is beautiful, the people are welcoming and it isn‚Äôt, as yet, inundated with tourists every moment of the year (it will be soon though, you wait and see!).

Making money in the down market.," The only way to make money is to short BTC. If you believe the market is going up for sure, longing BTC right now is insanely profitable. Bitmex is a great place to be in a time of so much volatility! 

 First of all, the draw of Bitmex is you can do what's called Leveraged trading. In the simplest terms possible, it means you multiply your percentage gains/losses. If you go 10x leverage long on bitcoin and bitcoin gains 1%, you gain 10% more money. This is super cool for impatient people like me because it allows you to trade more actively without getting wrecked by fees, and it's ridiculously exciting.

Bitmex doesn't allow US users, but supposedly, all you need to do is register under a VPN and you're good to go. I used ExpressVPN. It is a paid VPN, but they have a 30 day money back guarantee. You can register on Bitmex with it, then cancel. Or keep it because it's actually a super nice program.

Once you're registered, deposit some BTC into your Bitmex wallet. When you first open the trade screen it's going to look super complicated. It's not.

Buying Long on a coin means you expect it to go up. Buying short on a coin means you expect it to go down. Playing those buys works like any other Exchange (i.e. Binance). You can set a limit price to buy in at and an amount. to buy.

Now you want to pick your leverage. In the menu below that, there's a slider. Again, each multiplier of leverage means every 1% = your leverage multiplier. 1% gain with a 25x leverage means 25% gain. I would start with 2x/3x leverage until you get a good handle on things.

The Cost number below the buy long/buy short number is the big one here. With leverage, you're essentially putting loaned money toward a coin. With 10x leverage, you can buy 1 BTC even if you only have .1 BTC (this is why the percentage gains are so drastic). However, this means you can lose it as well.

Let's say you bought 1 BTC at $10000, Long at 10x leverage (So you put in $1000). If BTC dropped 10% to $9000, you would lose all $1000 you put in. If it went to $11000, you would gain $1000 and double your money. Bitmex will auto ""liquidate you"" if you drop too far and don't have any more money to cover (10x leverage means if it drops more than 10% you lose all the money you put in. 25x leverage means if it drops more than 4% you lose all your money).

You can change orders on the fly and constantly adjust. Let's say BTC raised to $10100 (1%). You could then sell your long order and you will have gained 10% and now you can invest your $1100.

Like I said, there's a ton of guides out there that go into the more fancy TA and ways you can adjust orders, but this should provide a quick overview to get you started. They have a testnet site where you can practice with fake money first as well.

Best New Crypto(Bitcoin) Exchange,"After testing this platform for over a month, I can say that [Correx.io](https://Correx.io) is the best new exchange out there. It's based in Toronto, Canada and licensed as an MSB in the US. I've never waited more than 15 mins for a response from customer staff and they are by far the most courteous reps I've ever dealt with. They offer 27 pairs, but they are the most important ones. They adding 40 more in the next 30 days. Free deposits/withdrawals and considerably low fees are nice too. They don't keep any coins/tokens onsite which makes me feel very secure about my funds and the trading platform itself is one of the easiest I've used. They even offer an exchange guide to teach newer traders how to navigate through their site. The order book is the largest one I've ever seen, including Binance's so I know the secret is out now. Rumour is, they might be rebranding as a ""private members only"" exchange for VIP's. The good news is that all existing members will keep their membership forever. My advice is to at least sign up so you lock in your membership.

Speaking of VIP's, they are paid 0.1% as market makers on every trade. This is a first. .........Overall IMO [Correx.io](https://Correx.io) is an industry leader and I highly recommend it. Nobody asked me to write this review nor was I compensated in any way.....

"SHIFT, reason why it is scam junk and reason why BTC is the only one that stands","So when this coin was born, early adopters and believers are getting slaps now, piss in the face etc...

&amp;#x200B;

since i mine this coin, and also purchase it, lock wallet data files for a better times now i see that devs do great job.

&amp;#x200B;

They waited for crypto Armageddon when many people don't watch crypto, do a coin swap, all people who didn't know for swap just give a dev a big tip, because they took all our coins.

 

Nice work and job done, open scam with clean hands, this is why BTC is The One and only and the rest, like this shift i believed in, seems to be the biggest scam crap of all craps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Someone in old post mentioned grace period, you didn't possess win10 update, so grace period was at the beginning, this was like you purchase win10, and after one year they tell you you cant use it anymore since you didn't swap it, yea right, this is open ripoff of user coins.

&amp;#x200B;

So since this happened storing and keeping wallet files and even holding crap nammed Shift is useless, since they took nice cash doing swap once, wait for some time and do coin swap again, and again, and again, so when you scam users and take 99% of their coins do some massive insane coin pump, so people will get horny and start to purchase, after cooldown do again coin swap and ripoff users by taking them their coins.",1538462855,02/10/2018 06:47:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kof0v/shift_reason_why_it_is_scam_junk_and_reason_why/,1

Six months down the road...,"Hello,
I am a volunteer who has no salary. (Why did I do this again?)
I have been wanting to invest for a long time.
Alas, I have had no money for a long time.(I have volunteered my life away.)

After I complete my service, in six months, I am given a few thousand as a form of payment for service, something given in the hopes the volunteers will use it wisely.

I want to invest some of this sum in cc, specifically btc, ltc, eos, and maybe neo and powr, from what i‚Äôve researched.  I‚Äôm in it for the long run, and not a quick buck.

I‚Äôm so tired if struggling and I want to give this a shot.  Even if I lose my investment it will be worth it to me. But I don‚Äôt reckon that will happen.

Unfortunately I have no funds (except the last 40 in my bank account that I exchanged for practice/to get used to the ui, etc, until I‚Äôm ready to invest more heavily). I now have zero dollars to my name, not remembering my student loans. (Note- I realize that investing seems crazy in such a situation but I won‚Äôt invest a large percent of what my organization gives me, and have months of volunteering after that in which I receive a stipend to live, during this time student loans aren‚Äôt applicable- except the interest. I have thought it out)

I believe that bitcoin will rise.  I believe it will be adopted by many and believe in the technology as well as the philosophy. 

Question: lets say all goes swimmingly and btc keeps steadily rising until hitting that 7k threshold required before going to that 20k, and then even upwards after that.  What do you think the price will be six months from now?  Have I a chance to invest, or in six months will the price have risen rapidly and any investment becomes null.  Year-long forecasts may show that 20k.. what of six months? Obviously looking for opinions as i know the market is somewhat volatile.  I dream of taking this chance, because the technology *will* be.

Thank you everyone for your thoughts.

Child key derivation - size of child private keys - don't get it,"I got this book about bitcoin, I'm trying to understand what's going on, but things don't quite add up for me...

I've included the portion of the book below, so you can see what I'm talking about.

It says the parent private key is 256bits. I hash the parent public key + parent chain code + i to get a 512bit hash. I take the left half (256bits) and add it to the parent private key (256bits)... so? that would be 512 bits then? But apparently no - it's just 256bits -- which kind of makes sense, because the parent private key was 256bits, so we would expect the child private key to be the same... but it doesn't add up for me. Can anyone explain pls?

Bitcoin mining opportunities in Georgia and tours in mining farms," 

Each country has its advantages and disadvantages for crypto mining and I want to inform you about my country.

Wrote an article about it and I am open for suggestions.

See the link for the article: [https://blocknews.ge/georgia/tbilisi-the-capital-of-crypto-mining-ig](https://blocknews.ge/georgia/tbilisi-the-capital-of-crypto-mining-ig)

I am planning to organize a tour in mining farms in Georgia. Everyone who is interested in mining opportunities and advantages in Georgia, has a chance to take a look from inside the farm.

Tours may include detailed information about how the farms are set up, what are the costs of running a farm here and also you'll have an opportunity to discuss your ideas to other interested investors and maybe start a business with joined forces :)

Introducing the 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge,"Not too long ago Bitcoin wasn't worth much (USD wise) but as an early adopter I was there! Mining them on my desktop computer on a daily basis. At a later point in time I even bought more, a lot more. This was my best investment ever!

&amp;#x200B;

My Bitcoins quickly became a treasure chest and while I don't want to provide numbers I can tell you that Bitcoin changed my life for good. On top of that, bitcoin airdrops were created. I thought it would be nice to give those away to someone else in the universe, as I don't need them. Just for fun. ( In the end I got them for free too ).

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about ideas on how to do this I finally created a bitcoin challenge where  BTC is to be found, hidden in a digital picture. I have to admit it wasn't as easy as I projected and I had to exchange all airdrops for BTC. While this wasn't a easy process for all of them, creating the picture was the most difficult since I'm not a artist myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, finally, I can announce the 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge.

Yes, that's correct, there's **310 BTC hidden in the picture**.

&amp;#x200B;

Head over to [https://bitcoinchallenge.codes/](https://bitcoinchallenge.codes/) for more details.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck!

Bitcoin Price Analysis - 10/02/2018,"On September 29, the #BTCUSD pair had been range bound. The price is consolidating for a possible breakout in the days ahead. However, the BTC price has failed to break the $6,800 price level in the last month.

*Bullish scenario: Bulls are interested to overcome the low volume level of $6680. Today, they will try to break it through and gain a foothold in the $6750 area. The global target for bulls are the highs ($6840).

*Bearish scenario: Bears will try to break through the trend and test Monday lows. This scenario involves a return to the center of the high volume ($6450) and a possible attack on the September 25 lows ($6300).

*Neutral scenario: Fluctuations in the $6500‚àí6650 range are expected. However, after three days of consolidation, a neutral scenario is not likely today.",1538487239,02/10/2018 13:33:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kqnaf/bitcoin_price_analysis_10022018/,1

"I got a job offer from a Bitcoin exchange in another country, but it feels like a scam.","Basically, I got a Job offer a few days ago to work with a Bitcoin exchange company in another country.

After asking for more info on the job, I got an email from an ""Exchange Officer"".

The title of the job is ""Customer Support Agent""

These are the step by step instructions he gave me regarding the job;


&gt;1 - Our client from your country submits a bitcoin purchase request to us.

&gt;2 - We provide him with a customer support agent's bank account details for the payment.


&gt;3 - Our client transfers the payment via his (her) bank account and notifies us.

&gt;4 - We inform you by phone and email that the bitcoin purchase transaction has been made. And send you an email with the bitcoin purchase information and client's bitcoin details.

&gt;This operation will require from you to withdraw the money at your bank branch and to be fulfilled at the bitcoin ATM machine in your city to the given details.


Why do they need to use my personal bank account?

Why can't they just create a bank account in my country and then hire me to process the exchange?

This feels like a scam, but they seem legit.

They have a great looking website, a physical address that has existed for more than five years and the email address isn't generic (Gmail/Hotmail) but a company email.

I researched further by analysing their website using Who.Is 

**The website was created a month ago....**

Now that could be explained as them creating a new website and deciding they needed a new domain....or this is all a scam and I'll have Police at my front door in a few months.

DBXChain strenghten its technical dominance with technical partnership with AWS,"What Is DBXChain?

The DBXChain is a new public chain that has been created by the DBX Foundation. It intends to be a value-based ecosystem of data that will be made on the blockchain. This new ecosystem will create a decentralized community that will be able to provide a platform for people who want to use it.

This network will be able to provide a safe data exchange process and to allow its users to own their data, unlike many companies that create products that basically steal the data from the user. The DBX Foundation believes that the users are entitled to the data that is produced by them and not the owners of the platform.


DBX Foundation completed their Blockchain Testnet of DBXChain in May 2018 with the aim to build up a data-based ecosystem, including basement blockchain technology, smart contracts, eco-community and more. DBXChain will be able to conduct 1,000,000 TPS (Parallel Side-Chain) and high security through its D-DPoS Consensus Mechanism. The Blockchain will implement a Data-Storage Side-Chain to enable exchanging and exploring valuable data with low costs, fair trading, and increased efficiency. To ensure quality of the infrastructure DBX Foundation has initiated cooperation with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its partner programme ‚ÄúAWS Partner Network‚Äù.

AWS and AWS Partner Network will provide the technical foundation to run the virtual machine of DBXChain for efficiency and stability. AWS has more than 10 times the computing capacity in use than the next 14 largest cloud companies combined. DBXChain will in the future be able to utilize the massive economies of scale, increased speed and agility of AWS to store the vast amount of unstructured and structured data, for fast and stable computing of the DBXChain.

About Amazon Web Services

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

Personal Growth in the Cryptosphere,"Hello Mr and Mrs. Crypto Bosses,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 22-year old business owner and entrepreneur, and I have made a commitment to the cryptospace and have built a vision for myself that includes being in it for the long run. 

I'm sure we've all experienced and been swayed at times into decisions by the voices of the multitudes who are only in it for the hype, and that has to end!

My question to you all is, how can one who has ample time, energy, and desire best gain knowledge, and harvest facts from the vast amounts of information available?

This goes for investing, trading, mining, entrepreneurship, and even the technical side, any and all top resources will assist me and many others in one day becoming leaders within crypto!

I have dedicated myself to becoming as much of an expert as I can over my lifetime, and I'd love to hear how you all have gotten to where you are!  


&amp;#x200B;

[Continuation] My Binance account was blocked 4 weeks ago and support has just simply ignored me. Have I lost all of my money?,"My previous post -[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9j27r2/my\_binance\_account\_was\_blocked\_3\_weeks\_ago\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9j27r2/my_binance_account_was_blocked_3_weeks_ago_and/)

**Dear Binance** [u/Jager\_Binance](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jager_Binance),

4 weeks past from my wallet was blocked

Thanks to my previous post I finally receive a feedback form Binance team but unfortunately the feedback didn‚Äôt consist the answer on all my questions and it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt a cause of unlocking of my account.

The first ‚Äúsecurity reason‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a real cause of blocking of my account. As they told me the real reason was ‚Äúfraudulent activities and some malicious hacking operations‚Äù by law enforcement request.

https://i.redd.it/mbq9gblcwsp11.jpg

1. I was withdrawing and making money exclusively on other exchanges. 

2. I haven‚Äôt displayed new addresses for the last month. All addresses have been listed on Binance and you have been doing transactions on them for the past 2 months. Why have you just now blocked my account? 

3. I was withdrawing and making money on other exchanges. And addresses can be traced across the blockchain to the well-know ‚Äúcold‚Äù wallet of exchanges.

The thing that we didn‚Äôt do any malicious or fraudulent activity for sure, in other fact we will be blocked on other exchanges as well. But we faced only with the Binance.And why at the very beginning they lied to me about real reason of my account blocking? If they told me this information, shortly after our conversation in Skype, we could avoid unnecessary waste of my resources to attract Binance attention.

Anyway, when we asked Binance representative to connect us with law enforcement organisation directly to allow me provide them any proofs and answer any question to speed up a connection (remember, my account was blocked for a month already) we recieved a negative answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0gzn1tbewsp11.jpg

Dear [u/Jager\_Binance](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jager_Binance) My question is. 

How long should I wait more to unblock my account or receive all relevant information from your side? 

Why you can't connect us directly with the law enforcement or even explain why you can't do it?

It‚Äôs not funny. You hold a lot of my money for a long time already. 

P.S. I also posted this message in Binance subreddit and hope they will not delete it at this time.",1538498948,02/10/2018 16:49:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ksbaj/continuation_my_binance_account_was_blocked_4/,1

15% Bitcoin cash, as they are stuck in a paper wallet and can't be arsed to move them

What does HODL really mean.,"Moody today. Why? Might as well count up the days Bitcoin goes close to 10G before it comes tumbling back down to a stable 5G. Ten Grand is the price my dad bought in and has been bitter about the loss he incurred ever since it dropped to 9G. No one wants to lose money, I understand, but it's not really a loss until you cash out. I told that to my dad and he says as soon as it hits 10G he's taking his money out. 

Leads me to the next question. What's your number for cashing out? What is everyone's number at which they'll cash out of Bitcoin? Lol. Doo you really think Bitcoin is ""going to the mooooooon"" as the Hodges Twins always says, while everybody intends to cashout of it at some point? That's like hoping the whale will show up to the shore but people keep drinking all the water from the sea. Or like hoping to take the rocket to the moon but everybody keeps taking the fuel from the rocket and putting it into their cars and driving away to the local stores. 

Quite frankly it's insane to think Bitcoin will ""go to the moon"" if everyone who buys in is only looking to make a quick buck and remove their gains out. But, what happens to Bitcoin price if everyone just keeps their money in it and use Bitcoin as it was intended to be used i.e make purchases. Lol.  Yes, remember? Remember Bitcoin can buy you things without having to cashout of it before you do it? Remember you can buy a Lamborghini from Moon Lambos with Bitcoin without permission from a bank before doing it. Remember there's an easy way to buy houses using a company like Propy.inc to handle deeds and accepts Bitcoin for payment? So many apparel stores accept Bitcoin, jewelry stores, there's a way to buy products from Amazon using Bitcoin if you wanted to. 

So, why cashout of Bitcoin? Why take all those steps to go back to cash when you can just use what you already have as cryptocurrency to do the very same thing. 

Cashing out is fascinating because of the gains made. But damaging because it drops everyone else gains. Didn't care? Probably doesn't hit the mark. Because why care about everyone eles, you got yours. Lol

This is why HODL loses it's mark. HODL for what?

Question about stuck transactions in Andreas video,"Hi everyone, I got a question about stuck transactions.

In this video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsdW0CTYwyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsdW0CTYwyY) Andreas explains how to unstuck transactions :

\- first with RBF transactions (at 3:20)

\- second with simple double spending with higher fee (at 4:00)

\- last with Parents Pays For Child. (at 4:48)

The first and last method are clear for me, but I can't understand the second one. Andread talk about it at 4:00.

Even if I could imagine that miners accepts to remove the previous transactions from their mempool and replace it with the new one (with custom node code ?), I can't figure out how this second transaction will reach miners. Andreas explains that it's a wallet management problem, but I don't understand why : if my second transaction touch one of the full node on the bitcoin network, with Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 for exemple, it will immediatly be rejected as a conflicted transaction and not relayed to any node. Without RBF, it can't be relayed to the miners, except if my transaction reach miners without any Bitcoin Core Node on the path to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone explain me how this work ? Thanks in advance !",1538515062,02/10/2018 21:17:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kuqq4/question_about_stuck_transactions_in_andreas_video/,1

Limitation on security issues in blockchain technology,"Presently, there are two mainly parts of the technical threats on the digital currency exchange and cryptocurrency exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Traditional vulnerabilities on the information system security**

Intuitively, digital currency exchanges are not much different from traditional financial institutions. The entire information system incorporates web servers, back-end databases and other elements. Users use browsers, mobile apps, and APIs, which provided by exchange platform, to do the daily transaction.

We can see that the security threats lie mainly in server software vulnerabilities, improper configuration, DDoS attacks, server-side web application vulnerabilities (including technical vulnerabilities and business logic defects), and malicious attack after social engineering.

For those large-scale exchanges with a large number of users, there are problems that the attackers use a phishing website to obtain authentication information of users. According to the official statement, the attackers used fraudulent scams to defraud users' authentication credentials, and then use the credentials to generate a large number of transactions, and other kinds of cryptocurrencies in the user's account. The transaction became bitcoin, and the currency was found to be abnormal in time, and coin-withdraw request was hold. Interestingly, although the attacker can't raise the coin, they came up with another clever way of profiting. Using a large amount of bitcoin controlled by them to manipulate the market, affecting the price of other currencies, and then trading in another digital currency futures. The short-selling operation resulted in a profit of even more than $100 million without withdraw bitcoin. Theoretically, they did not steal the digital currency, only ‚Äúchanged the currency‚Äù. Because a large number of short orders were scattered in hundreds of exchange platforms, hardly can they be detected.

Last month, a security team said that they found a zero-day vulnerability, which is a logical loophole in the entire station of a cryptocurrency exchange application. There are hundreds of small and medium-sized exchanges using the application. Although the public generally believes that large exchanges will not buy and use the whole station program developed by third-party developers, the fact that cryptocurrency industry has high profits and rapid development does attract much flood in. Actually, there are many people who want to enter the market quickly.

In the digital currency industry, some individuals and teams engaged in this type of development have limited ability to guarantee product quality, which is not surprising.

For the solution to this kind of security threat, it can be prevented through the penetration service, code audit and other security services. By mining and repairing the security vulnerabilities in the system, you can greatly mitigate the threat.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Smart Contract Security Vulnerabilities**

Ethereum is known as the ""blockchain 2.0"" technology because it supports the operation of smart contracts. First, let‚Äôs take a quick review on what is Smart Contract. Smart contracts provide a chance that you can exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent and conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman.

The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a store, wait in line for checking out, and get what you want. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine for something, and it will drop what you want into your account. Moreover, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties basing on an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations without the interference of human beings. On the other hand, The Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM provides a runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is not only a sandbox but also completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem or other processes. In this way, a smart contract has limited access to the other smart contracts, which ensure security to some degree.

Ethereum bases on the Bitcoin system plus a ""contract"" that defines the rules for reward distribution. The emergence of Ethereum provides a ready-made network of underlying blockchains on which developers can use their programming language, such as Solidity, to develop and deploy their own smart contracts, including simulating a bitcoin-like product. Due to the fact that Solidity is a complete programming language, it can theoretically be used to implement various distributed systems.

After finishing the smart contract code, the code is deployed to the blockchain system and the program is executed on the EVM virtual machine of the Ethereum node. After the code is deployed to the blockchain, each node performs the consensus and synchronizes the data state.

Like traditional programs, there are inevitably security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The difference is that due to the unchangeable nature of blockchain, once the contract is deployed, it is difficult to fix the potential problem on the blockchain. For example, when token distribution contracts with vulnerabilities such as integer overflow are deployed, the vulnerability is triggered to be exploited. In a short period of time, a large number of tokens will affect the market value, which will cause huge losses for both the exchange and the users.

This part of the security threat is very different from the traditional information security loophole. Similar attacks have occurred in traditional financial markets, such as the operation of Soros against the Hong Kong dollar during the Asian financial crisis of the late 20th century. The difference is that in the traditional financial market, in order to launch such an attack requires a huge amount of financial support to achieve. In the field of cryptocurrency, people with the ability to exploit potential vulnerabilities are theoretically able to achieve such an attack.

The actual threat situation may be much more serious than this. The reason why smart contracts are ""smart"" is that once the chain is deployed, the execution process is transparent, can't be falsified, and no human intervention is needed, which naturally solves the trust problem in the execution process. This is also the fundamental problem we want to solve when blockchain technology appears. On the other head, if smart contract itself has a loophole and is used after the execution is started, which deviates from the original intention, the excellent characteristics of the blockchain technology will become an obstacle to save the loss.

In response to this kind of security threat, the smart contract security audit work should be carried out to prevent the possible attack threats.

Organic UTXO consolidation (in the course of regular payments),"For UTXO-based cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Litecoin, it is important to have the set of managed Unspent Transaction Outputs in optimal shape, because if you have too much small UTXO, you will have to create bigger transactions to send the same amount of funds, and hence pay bigger network fee, or even need to send several transactions to transfer the needed amount.

Typical approach to handle this is to do periodical sweep of UTXO, bundling them all together, at the time when network fee is low.

We implemented another approach, that does not require manual UTXO consolidation, and at the same time, conserves network fee - when fee in the network is high, the algorithm tries to use less UTXO per transaction, and when network fee is low, it will create bigger transaction, effectively performing UTXO consolidation along with regular payments. This organic UTXO consolidation allows to maintain healthy UTXO set automatically, without manual consolidation runs.

We implemented it this way:

Define a rate that you are OK to pay in terms of monetary percentage: we call it ""fee per full coin"". Basically, you say, ""to send 1 btc, I am willing to pay 0.001 btc""

When building a transaction, we calculate optimal tx size like this:

optimal_tx_vsize = utxo_sum * fee_per_full_coin / fee_per_kb

The closer candidate transaction to the optimal size, the better score it will get.

Of course we cannot always find the optimal transaction, but we will try to choose the one with best score, depending on available UTXO set.

The resulting effect is that when fee_per_kb is high, optimal_tx_vsize will be low (may be even zero), and we will choose the smallest tx possible with current UTXO set. When fee_per_kb is low, optimal_tx_vsize will be high, and we will choose transactions with more UTXO, performing organic UTXO consolidation.

---

If more wallets implement this type of optimizations, it will result in more healthy global UTXO set.",1538537076,03/10/2018 03:24:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kxk01/organic_utxo_consolidation_in_the_course_of/,1

"New Research Report States That Ethereum is Going to ZERO! Will This Kill the ""Flippening"" Talks Forever??","So, I'm not sure if you guys have seen it or not - but Bitcoinexchangeguide recently posted up this link: 

https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/why-you-should-expect-ethereum-to-eventually-hit-zero-the-ultimate-eth-bear-case/ 

I'm inclined to actually agree with a lot of what the article said. And if what they said is true...then Bitcoin is pretty much in a race with itself.

Everyone knows that Ripple $XRP can't compare to Bitcoin and Bitcoin certainly isn't facing pending litigation like $XRP is either. 

And if you think bcash is competition? Ha. Ha. Ha. Let's be serious guys. 

While this doesn't have to do with Bitcoin specifically, this is bullish because it shows that Bitcoin truly is the ONLY cryptocurrency that looks as though it's going to be here for a lonnnngggggg time.

Startup that wants to accept Bitcoin. How do I do this and which service is best and easiest?,"Hi everyone!

Excuse me if this is a basic question, but I am looking to set up my start up online business with crypto payments as soon as we launch. Is there a point of sale that is easy to set up and use? Pros and cons of such service?

I've gotten into bitcoin and crypto fairly deeply in early 2017 and am looking to support the cause even in this bear market.

Also, although we don't show it in our website, one of the reasons we want to set this up is that our product name was partly inspired by crypto.  Our product name is **HangOn**, which inspired by HODL. So we thought it would make sense for us to increase adoption of crypto with our launch. 

Some random information about our start up if you're interested: we are launching an FDA compliant product that helps you feel better after a long night of drinking. We're in beta testing now and plan to launch within the next several months. 

Our website is still preliminary, and we are still using a shopify template for now. Would that be an issue or is there an app that works well on that platform?

Any and all feedback greatly appreciated!

Our website is here: https://tryhangon.com/

I mean using a demo account you can double your deposit in an hourüòä as there are different prices and you just do easy arbitrage.

That‚Äôs why demo's profits can hurt you. It is better to sacrifice $2 to learn at live account trading with Satoshi. Many people start trading with $2000 or more what is a huge mistake.

In the case of the vending machine example at the start of this post, a modified vending machine receives a bitcoin payment via a built-in QR code and through the Lightning Network. While this is still far from a commercial proposition, it demonstrates how the Lightning Network could allow small bitcoin transactions to happen on a much bigger scale than is currently possible.

Correx.io," 

Sorry I was asked to repost this.......After testing this platform for over a month, I can say that [Correx.io](https://correx.io/) is the best new exchange out there. It's based in Toronto, Canada and licensed as an MSB in the US. I've never waited more than 15 mins for a response from customer staff and they are by far the most courteous reps I've ever dealt with. They offer 27 pairs, but they are the most important ones. They adding 40 more in the next 30 days. Free deposits/withdrawals and considerably low fees are nice too. They don't keep any coins/tokens onsite which makes me feel very secure about my funds and the trading platform itself is one of the easiest I've used. They even offer an exchange guide to teach newer traders how to navigate through their site. The order book is the largest one I've ever seen, including Binance's so I know the secret is out now. Rumour is, they might be rebranding as a ""private members only"" exchange for VIP's. The good news is that all existing members will keep their membership forever. My advice is to at least sign up so you lock in your membership.

Speaking of VIP's, they are paid 0.1% as market makers on every trade. This is a first. .........Overall IMO [Correx.io](https://correx.io/) is an industry leader and I highly recommend it. Nobody asked me to write this review nor was I compensated in any way.....

It creates a consolidated orderbook out of the current top 20 exchanges, performs order books clearance and proposes matching orders for each trader according to their goals.

"The Future of CryptoCurrencies, Blockchain and CryptoAssets","CryptoCurrencies, Blockchain and CryptoAssets have now been sanctioned and legitimized worldwide by the World Economic Forum. We will see the effect of this in the institutions and their media initially, then we will see this reflected in the price. While this is not Financial Advice, I predict the coming bull market will be the biggest yet; almost all coins will reach new All Time Highs. We will also see within 3 - 6 months a big announcement or a big investment by one or more institutional investment companies, I predict. I cannot say which coin will benefit the most at this stage. Probably not Bitcoin, though that will rise to a new All Time High. The biggest gains will most likely be made with one of the coins with a market cap in the single digit millions with a viable product; a platform and one with large transactions per second and scaling capabilities.

‚Äã

Here are the videos from the World Economic Forum‚Äôs YouTube account in which they discuss CryptoCurrencies, Blockchain and CryptoAssets:

With global digital payment volumes predicted to increase by an average of 10.9% to 2020, regulators have issued a range of responses to the crypto-asset craze. How can regulators work with businesses and consumers to support burgeoning crypto markets while safeguarding the financial order? Dimensions addressed: Access to capital via blockchain-enabled initial coin offerings (ICOs); Digital storage and protection of intellectual property via smart contracts; Overlapping financial ecosystems with fiat digital currencies.

While 90% of goods in global trade are carried by the shipping industry, the cost of processing documents and information for a container shipment is estimated at more than twice the cost of the transport. What is needed to accelerate blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies to bring efficiency, transparency, and interoperability to global supply chains? Dimensions addressed: Smart contracts for physical goods; Customs and tariffs payments at ports of trade; Trade finance standards for machine-to-machine payments.

‚Äã

In this video, Digital Trade is discussed:

Digital trade accounts for 12% of international trade, while data flows have increased ninefold in the past 10 years and are predicted to increase another fivefold by 2022. What is needed to overcome the remaining barriers to reach seamless global digital trade? Dimensions addressed: Reliable and verified digital payments systems for global value chains; Channels for data flows across borders; Mobile platforms as a tool for social and financial inclusion.

‚Äã

If you are interested in the direction CryptoCurrencies, Blockchain and CryptoAssets, as well as Digital Trade, will most likely go in, I strongly suggest watching their videos and reading their Report.

Question: Do users expect a discount for using crypto instead of using fiat?,"I saw [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kw7ib/i_travel_to_orlando_and_see_this_the_future_is/) this AM and was curious what r/bitcoin thought about discounts for using crypto.

In my current situation a close friend has a startup that's finally going to market this week and the business owner isn't at all experienced in crypto so there'll be a learning curve for acceptance, converting to fiat for his vendor supply chain, and for taxes. His business is a startup so his available bandwidth is tight for adding on financial complexity.   

I'd imagine many businesses are similarly eyeing a cost/reward on accepting crypto and the discount is a real factor. 15% seems like a lot, is 5% reasonable? 0%?

Appreciate perspectives.

The Hardest Lessons are the Ones You Remember Most...,"Well, where to start... I had a majority of my funds in an Exodus wallet on my computer running Ubuntu, and then I started getting weird errors. I ended up only backing up the funds to my flash drive which I erased when reformatting all my drives and reinstalling windows. I did EVERYTHING to try to restore my funds but without the private keys, there was no hope. I learned the hard way that you have to be safe and:

1. Backup wallets
2. Backup those backups
3. And backup all of those backups

I was already down from when I bought in, but now I am pretty much cleaned out, and I learned the hard way about WHY you make multiple backups. Also, I would advise to avoid YObit's Dice game... In an panicked state, my effort to recover some of what I lost only lost me more in the process. Trying to get back thousands by wasting hundreds does not work. Desperation is dangerous and I learned you have to be especially mindful when looking for a quick way to recover. 

Hopefully, this serves as guidance as what NOT to do, and that future instances like mine can be avoided. I have never felt so ignorant and simpleminded in my whole life, and hope no one else has to go through this. 

 Here's to starting over at least, with a much more conscientious approach...

SF Blockchain Week,"I wanted to make a post here to discuss what is going on in San Francisco. We started planning SF Blockchain Week and had two goals in mind: 1) Get the best speakers and content possible and 2) Get as many individuals from the community to join this event and focus on the tech rather than hype and speculation. The support has been amazing. We are very proud of the speakers and workshops that will be present at this event. We had no idea that this wouldn‚Äôt be the important part. 

&amp;nbsp;

What we didn‚Äôt realize would happen is the movement that this has started. There are over 75 satellite events that are taking place around the main events we planned and all of their tickets are FREE. There are several other conferences taking place around this time and they have all reduced their prices. By pricing our tickets extremely low (less than cost of food provided) and giving hundreds away to developers who apply, we have forced other events to stop being extractive and compete on both quality of content and ticket value. It really is amazing and I personally think it is a step in the right direction. In order to push this space forward we need to engage and educate as many people as possible. No more absurd ticket prices and cash grabs; we as a community should no longer accept that. We hope that you can attend and would love for you to help #ChangeTheNarrative!  

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr Let's stop charging the community so much to learn about blockchain. I see so much focus on institutions and regulation but the real focus should be on education, at all levels, and the rest will follow.

Solar panels vs bitcoin miner?,"I am thinking of getting solar panels because I feel electricity bills will continue to rise in the future and I have heard of people who have solar panels and never pay any energy bills ever and just live off the sun.

This is where a battery like the Tesla Powerwall comes in.

Recording Informed Consent,"For situations where a user wants to share personal data, for example, sharing information with a doctor, there's a legal requirement in my country to track the user's ""informed consent"" to share.  I've seen blockchain proposed as a way to record an immutable hash of the user's identification and consent, in a way that can be audited later.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, to my thinking, this requires the application writing to the blockchain to be trusted.   That is, the application could have written out the consent information with or without the user's actual consent.  In case the consent is contested, what prevents the user from saying the consent was recorded erroneously?

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone thought through this scenario enough to suggest a way to remove the requirement of trust?  Is there a whitepaper?",1538604510,03/10/2018 22:08:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9l5vyc/recording_informed_consent/,1

Abra launches crypto index token,"[https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-abra-launches-fund-backed-token-product-for-investors/](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-abra-launches-fund-backed-token-product-for-investors/)

We just announced the launch of a new Abra crypto index token. One product that gives global retail investors access to 80% of the cryptocurrency market. Minimum investment is only $5!!

**How does it work?**

Abra's BIT10 token was created via a partnership with Bitwise who supplies the pricing and rebalancing rules. The BIT10 uses the same synthetic asset model as all of the other assets in Abra and is 100% collateralized in Bitcoin.

Feel free to ask any questions here and we'll do our best to answer. Thanks!",1538611640,04/10/2018 00:07:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9l6tpe/abra_launches_crypto_index_token/,1

Day trading/scalping with just BTCUSD?,"Ok first of all please don't let this thread turn into another anti day trading rant. Those 90% facts are true but only for people who don't understand proper risk/bankroll management and have a well defined strategy.

  
I have quite a decent enough edge when trading stocks or forex, but with my strategy and small account size the fees usually eat up the profit. So I have started trading BTC perpetual contract swaps on BitMEX as I can long or short with leverage for little to no fees.

  
My problem now though is that as I am limited to only trading 1 or 2 pairs, I feel that I am taking trades that I shouldn't be just to keep up my trading volume....

  
Right now, I have started rating potential trades from 1-10, and adjusting my risk based on that. And trying to think a few moves ahead for what set ups could appear then setting alerts and waiting for them.

  
But does anyone have any other advice for trading in this style?

  
Edit: I am currently trying to make 2-3 trades per day with around 0.5-2% account risk per trade and between 1:1 to 2:1 risk reward ratios.",1538650102,04/10/2018 10:48:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9larun/day_tradingscalping_with_just_btcusd/,1

Boom! BTC's Price this Year Lower Than $9000. Is It Real?,"Mike Novogratz's predictions about BTC's price changed again.

Now, CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital Capital Management, updated his thoughts regarding BTC's price. He said, There are no chances BTC will reach a higher price than 9000$. 

Where did he put another price limit for BTC? Back in Nov 2017, When crypto's price skyrocketed, he predicted that Bitcoin could climb as high as $45,000 within 12 months. Unfortunately, he changed his mind.

In mid-September he opined that crypto prices have hit the bottom. Later that month he reiterated this point of view, saying that crypto markets are experiencing ‚Äúseller fatigue.‚Äù Anyway, he thinks now it is a good time for investment, for the price is quite stable, Mike Novogratz said.

1.2K BTC has been blocked on my Binance account for a month and no clear response from their team yet.,"**A month ago Binacne blocked my old, active account that was 3d level verified and full of 1.2K BTC.**

The account was created and used for arbitrage on cryptocurrency markets and everything was good for a long time before Binance decided to block it.

Since then I‚Äôve had a long conversation with their representative where I provided all my documents (even more that it was necessary), passed video verification and fund verification as well.

During our conversation they changed the reason for blocking my account a few times and as a conclusion it‚Äôs still blocked.

The first reason was ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù the last one was ‚Äúlaw enforcement‚Äù which they don‚Äôt want to connect me directly with. And you know what, I don‚Äôt believe them at all.

1. I make deposits from and make withdrawals exclusively to other well recognized exchanges from Top-10 exchanges.
2. I haven‚Äôt made withdrawals to any new addresses for last month. All withdrawals were from addresses that I used before for as long as several months. Why have you just now blocked my account?
3. All my withdrawals can be traced to well-known cold wallets of respectable exchanges (all were in top 10, according to CMC).
4. The hackers don‚Äôt do any arbitrage.
5. It's strictly prohibited to tell anyone that reason of blocked account is law enforcement (in case it's real reason, not like in my case). If it's really law enforcement they will connect you directly without any 3d party.

**My accounts on other exchanges are active**, so, I‚Äôm just wondering for what reasons is Binance holding my money with no rules or reasons for it?

I just kindly ask the official Binance representative to let me know that an investigtion about the account has beed started.

[u/Binance](https://www.reddit.com/u/Binance) How long does it take to finally solve the issue with my account as they‚Äôve had all the documents and information for more than a month?

Is there anyone who‚Äôs faced the same situation? What kind of actions should I take against Binance to get my funds back?",1538665342,04/10/2018 15:02:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lco4l/12k_btc_has_been_blocked_on_my_binance_account/,1

Soo after almost 3 months of setting up I have my own LN full node running on RP3,"I have been eager to try LN mainnet since the very beginning of it. I've found about lnd, eclair, zap and other wallets but every scenario I tried to use it failed because of critical issues:

* eclair does not really constitute a wallet, it's more like a credit card - you can send money but not receive it
* lnd is okay, but requires a server and tons of resources for maintaining a full node, can't be used securely, efficiently and mobily at the same time
* zap offers some cloud wallet (in testnet!) by default, this is a serious misunderstanding of my cryptoanarchy needs
* web wallets - ah, forget it

So I've decided to use my Raspberry Pi with a very old laptop HDD attached (200GB) to create a backend wallet service and zap desktop (temporarily!) as my frontend control panel.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0vcq147887q11.png

Setting up Pi is easy, lots of tutorials over the internet, not gonna discuss it here. Then I had to obtain bitcoind (current rel: bitcoin-0.17.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) and lnd (lnd-linux-armv7-v0.5-beta.tar.gz), create a bitcoin technical user, deploy the tools, install systemd services and go through the configs. This is a tricky part, so let's share:

    # Generated by https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/
    
    # This config should be placed in following path:
    # ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
    
    # [core]
    # Set database cache size in megabytes; machines sync faster with a larger cache. Recommend setting as high as possible based upon machine's available RAM.
    dbcache=100
    # Keep at most &lt;n&gt; unconnectable transactions in memory.
    maxorphantx=10
    # Keep the transaction memory pool below &lt;n&gt; megabytes.
    maxmempool=50
    # Reduce storage requirements by only storing most recent N MiB of block. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. WARNING: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC, greater than 550 = automatically prune blocks to stay under target size in MiB).
    prune=153600
    
    # [network]
    # Maintain at most N connections to peers.
    maxconnections=40
    # Use UPnP to map the listening port.
    upnp=1
    # Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h), 0 = no limit.
    maxuploadtarget=5000
    
    # [debug]
    # Log IP Addresses in debug output.
    logips=1
    
    # [rpc]
    # Accept public REST requests.
    rest=1
    
    # [wallet]
    # Do not load the wallet and disable wallet RPC calls.
    disablewallet=1
    
    # [zeromq]
    # Enable publishing of raw block hex to &lt;address&gt;.
    zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
    # Enable publishing of raw transaction hex to &lt;address&gt;.
    zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
    
    # [rpc]
    # Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.
    server=1
    # Username and hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The field &lt;userpw&gt; comes in the format: &lt;USERNAME&gt;:&lt;SALT&gt;$&lt;HASH&gt;. RPC clients connect using rpcuser=&lt;USERNAME&gt;/rpcpassword=&lt;PASSWORD&gt; arguments. You can generate this value with the ./share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py script in the Bitcoin Core repository. This option can be specified multiple times.
    rpcauth=xxx:yyy$zzz
    

Whooaa, this online config generator is really helpful, but still had to manually correct a few things. The last line is obviously generated by rpcauth.py, I disabled the wallet functionality as lnd is going to take care of my funds. ZMQ is not available to the network so only my LND can use it, RPC usage I still have to think through a little, in general I would like to have my own block explorer some day but also be safe from any hacking attempts (thus I would need at least 2 RPC ports/user accounts - one for lnd, one for block explorer frontend). No ports open on firewall at this time, only UPnP is active and gently opens 8333 for block/tx transfers.

Now, synchronizing the blockchain took me time from mid-July to the early September... The hard drive is really slow, also my external HDD drive has some trouble with its A/C adapter so Pi was getting undervoltage alerts all the time. Luckily, it is just downclocking when it happens and slowly but steadily synchronized the whole history. After all, I'm not paying even $5 monthly for a VPS, it is by design the cheapest hardware I could use to set up my LN wallet.

When bitcoind was ready (I've heard some stories about btcd but I don't trust this software yet, sorry), it's time to configure lnd.conf:

    [Application Options]
    debuglevel=trace
    rpclisten=0.0.0.0:10009
    
    externalip=X.X.X.X:9735
    listen=0.0.0.0:9735
    alias=X
    color=#XXXXXX
    
    [Bitcoin]
    bitcoin.active=1
    bitcoin.mainnet=1
    bitcoin.node=bitcoind
    
    [Bitcoind]
    bitcoind.rpchost=127.0.0.1
    bitcoind.rpcuser=X
    bitcoind.rpcpass=X
    bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
    bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
    

Here I've had to XXX a little more fields, as not only the bitcoind RPC credentials are stored here, but also my node's public information (it should be illegal to run nodes specifically selected color and alias!). It is public, but not necessarily connected to my reddit account for most of the adversaries, so let's keep it this way. In fact, I also see a security vulnerability here: my whole node's stability depends on the IP being static. I could swap it for a .tk domain but who can tell if the bad guys won't actively fight DNS system in order to prevent global economic revolution? As such, I would rather see node identification in LN based on a public key only with possible \*hints\* of last-known-ip-address but the whole discovery should be performed by the nodes themself in a p2p manner, obviously preventing malicious actors from poisoning the network in some way. For now, I consider the IP stability a weak link and will probably have to pay extra Bitcoin TX fees when something happens to it (not much of a cost luckily!).

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hjd1nooo77q11.png

Okay then, lnd is up and running, had to create a wallet and give it a night for getting up to speed. I don't know really what took it so long, I'm not using Windows nor 'localhost' in the config so the issues like #1027 are not the case. But there are others like #1545 still open so I'm not going to ponder much on this. I haven't really got any idea how to automatically unlock the wallet after Pi restart (could happen any time!), especially since I only tried to unlock it locally with lncli (why would I enter the password anywhere outside that host?), but let's say that my wallet will only be as stable as my cheap hardware. That's okay for the beta phase.

Finally, zap-desktop required me to copy tls.cert and admin.macaroon files to my desktop. If my understanding of macaroon (it's like an authentication cookie, that can later be revoked) is correct then it's not an issue, however it would be nice to have a ""$50 daily limit"" macaroon file in the future too, just to avoid any big issues when my client machine gets stolen. Thanks to this, I can ignore the silly cloud-based modes and have fully-secure environment of my home network being the only link from me to my money.

https://i.redd.it/11bw3dgw47q11.png

Aaand there it is. The IP took some time to advertise, I use [1ml.com](https://1ml.com) to see if my node is there. The zap interface lacks lots of useful information so I keep learning lncli syntax to get more data about my new peers or the routes offered. The transactions indeed run fast and are ridiculously cheap. I would really love to run Eclair with the same settings but it doesn't seem to support custom lnd (why?). In fact, since all I need is really a lncli wrapper, maybe it will be easy to write my own (seen some web gui which weights 700MB after downloading all dependencies with npm - SICK!). I made a few demo transactions and now I will explore all those fancy t-shirt stores as long as the prices are still in ""early investor"" mode - I remember times when one could get 0.001 BTC from a faucet...

https://i.redd.it/42sdyoce57q11.png

If you find any of the facts presented by me false, I am happy to find out more in the discussion. However what I did I did mostly for fun, without paying much attention to the source code, documentation and endless issue lists on github. By no means I claim this tutorial will work for you but I do think I shared the key points and effort estimations to help others decide if they want a full-node LN client too. I'm also interested in some ideas on what to do with it next (rather unlikely that I will share my lnd admin.macaroon with anyone!) especially if it gives me free money. For example, I can open 1000 channels and start earning money from fees, although I no longer have more Bitcoins than the LN capacity yields... I will probably keep updating the software on my Pi until it leaves beta phases and only then will pour more money inside. I'm also keen on improving the general security of my rig and those comments I will answer more seriously.",1538672064,04/10/2018 16:54:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ldoj7/soo_after_almost_3_months_of_setting_up_i_have_my/,1

Payment Solutions for Bitcoin - Will Graft network serve as one? Comments please!,"I have been seeing many cryptos working towards the payment solutions (online integration/ Point of Sale integration etc). And many have even fallen back to centralized payment processors as Visa for Crypto payments . Found these quite contrary to the basic principles &amp; origin of the Bitcoin itself.

That's when I came across Graft network. They have their vision very clear on the white paper offering an entire payment processing Ecosystem. I knew, it has become customary in our crypto community, to call this as shilling. To be honest, I am trying to garner suggestions and support as a fellow community member. Below is Graft white paper link. 

https://www.graft.network/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Graft_White_Paper_2.01_May_2018.pdf

Graft's solution for Bitcoin payment is as follows.
1.Merchant installs GRAFT app on their PoS terminal. Chooses the Settlement option. Merchant has the freedom to choose the Settlement in either Fiat or Bitcoin or any other Crypto. Configures respective Wallet/Account details depending on the selection.
2.Now the merchant is ready to accept Crypto payments on his existing terminal. 
3.Customer (who is making Bitcoin payments) scans the QR code on the PoS terminal to make the payment. That's it.
4.Authorization happens in RealTime once the Bitcoin transaction is published and does not wait for Bitcoin block confirmation. This risk is borne by Exchange brokers which again is decentralized. And Settlement happens within a minute. 

White paper contains these processes in detail. 

Just to point out the credibility of the Graft project - leading global PoS terminal provider Verifone has approved Graft application to be placed on their market place. 
https://www.verifone.com/en/us/merchant-marketplace

It would be great if bitcoin community could support these promising projects that strives to bring Crypto adoption!!

Bitcoin‚Äôs Distribution Was Fair - Dan Held,"https://medium.com/@danhedl/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892   

TL;DR (from author's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danheld/status/1047884852454862849)):  

&gt; Many people think Bitcoin‚Äôs distribution wasn‚Äôt fair, or that Satoshi ‚Äústealth mined.‚Äù Below I dive into early mining, inequality, distribution, and ethics.

For a deeper dive, my Medium post: https://medium.com/@danhedl/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892 ‚Ä¶

TL;DR - check out this thread üëá  


&gt; Satoshi didn‚Äôt premine. Satoshi gave everyone a 2 month heads up before mining the Genesis block, reaching out to the only other people who would possibly be interested in experimenting with a sovereign digital currency at the time, the cypherpunks.  

&gt; The whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008, then Bitcoin 0.1 software was released on January 9, 2009. The genesis block (the only block specially minted earlier) has a timestamp of 18:15:05 GMT on January 3, 2009.  

&gt; Satoshi included a message in the Genesis Block as a ‚Äúproof of no premine.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks‚Äù  

&gt; Before Satoshi‚Äôs invention, the concept of pre-mining didn‚Äôt exist. To be this prescient demonstrated incredible maturity.

&gt; Anybody else could have mined by downloading the software (had a 1-click miner). The code to mine bitcoin was available on the day Satoshi began mining. Satoshi definitely wasn‚Äôt mining alone - we know for a fact that Hal Finney was mining one day after the initial launch.  


&gt; Satoshi mined because the network required a miner, he turned them off when there was a stable network that didn‚Äôt need his mining power. He reduced his % of the hashrate in a slow and steady manner. This implied Satoshi had a hashrate plan.  


&gt; How much did Satoshi mine? Other than 50 coins, it‚Äôs not empirically knowable how many he owned, but we can assign a high probability that he was the miner who minted close to ~700,000.  


&gt; BitMEX reviewed the original estimate made by Sergio Demian Lerner where he discovered that Satoshi‚Äôs miner ‚Äúfingerprint,‚Äù and concluded that there is reasonable evidence that a single dominant miner in 2009 could have generated around 700,000 bitcoin  

&gt; Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap was ~$0 for nearly a year and a half. Miners were wasting money on hardware and electricity to mine, with no guarantee that the Bitcoins they received would ever have value.  

&gt; ‚ÄúFaucets‚Äù were set up to freely distribute Bitcoins in order to ‚Äúseed‚Äù adoption. The first recorded exchange of Bitcoin for ‚Äúreal world‚Äù value occurred on May 22, 2010, where Laszlo Hanyecz agreed to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two delivered Papa John‚Äôs pizzas.  

&gt; ‚ÄúIt might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSatoshi Nakamoto  

&gt; The early pioneers were the ones crazy enough to take the financial, temporal and social risks to participate in the Bitcoin project, keeping it alive and acting as arbiters of the system in its early days. Nearly all lost or sold all of their Bitcoins  

&gt; With each of those boom/bust cycles we‚Äôve seen Bitcoin redistributed from old hodlers to new hodlers via selling, decreasing the Gini Coefficient. In 2017 alone, we saw 15% of all BTC move out of old hodler hands  


&gt; The theoretical total number of bitcoins, slightly less than 21M, should not be confused with the total spendable supply. The total spendable supply is always lower than the total supply, and is subject to accidental loss, willful destruction, and technical peculiarities  

&gt; ""Ten years ago cryptographers and HCI experts created the ultimate experiment to see how well human beings could hold onto long-lived secret keys...the results of that experiment have not been pretty.""‚Ää-‚ÄäSome Cryptographer on Twitter  

&gt; There are many stories of people losing BTC in large amounts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially in the early days‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen BTC wasn‚Äôt worth much and was easily forgotten on an old hard-drive, USB memory stick, even a scrap of paper.  

&gt; Coins which remain unspent for &gt;5 years have a high likelihood to be lost forever. Despite the richness of blockchain data, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to measure how much cryptocurrency is truly lost, as lost coins leave no trace in the blockchain.  

&gt; ‚ÄúThe study of lost bitcoin is geology masquerading as data science.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî @dhruvbansal  

Unchained Capital did a great analysis of lost coins and estimate: 2.78‚Äì3.79M BTC lost which aligns with another more sophisticated analysis done by Chainalysis  

&gt; ‚ÄúLost coins only make everyone else‚Äôs coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSatoshi Nakamoto  

&gt; From private key management mistakes, to scams and exchange hacks, to resisting selling temptation, early HODLers SURVIVED. In compensation for that risk, they absolutely deserve the value appreciation.  

&gt; Some argue Bitcoin‚Äôs distribution is analogous to a Ponzi scheme, but it‚Äôs nothing like one: it was transparent, offered no return, and has immense utility.  

 
&gt; ‚ÄúBitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock. More like a collectible or commodity.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSatoshi Nakamoto  

&gt; Satoshi was a person like any other, not some infallible being. This was the fairest distribution he could have come up with. It‚Äôs intellectually dishonest to compare Satoshi‚Äôs early mining of Bitcoin at a loss, with premining of an ICO with a positive market value.  

&gt; ""Bitcoin benefited from a very rare set of circumstances. Because it launched in a world where digital cash had no established value, they circulated freely. That can‚Äôt be recaptured today since everyone expects coins to have value. The immaculate conception""    

&gt; Other than sending a few worthless coins in test transactions, Satoshi never cashed out.",1538673921,04/10/2018 17:25:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ldynb/bitcoins_distribution_was_fair_dan_held/,1

1 bitcoin to 16 bitcoin in 12 months???,"Found this in bitcointalk

Investment strategy using compounding and in this case using sports. I have been using that method with fiat currency and I know it works like magic. But never experimented with bitcoin books. This can either work in your favor or work against even if you grow 1 coin to 16. For example, if someone started with 1 bitcoin when it was at peak earlier in the year, they would have lost a lot of value by now because of the bitcoin value drop. But if someone hadn started back in 2016, then the profits would be insane.",1538674609,04/10/2018 17:36:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9le29j/1_bitcoin_to_16_bitcoin_in_12_months/,1

I just withdrew 1 Satoshi on LND,"I've been playing around with LND for a while. Back in January I was probably one of the first few thousand people to use LN to buy a shirt and some stickers on blockstream.

Since then I've downloaded bitcoin core on my windows PC and used Eclair occasionally on satoshis. place.

I've recently set up a Bitcoin/LN node on a raspberry pi and have been messing around with 1 Satoshi payments here and there. Throughout all this, the awesomeness of it all hadn't hit me until today.

I set up a thin client on my phone to connect with my node while I'm away (via port forwarding) and while I was picking up groceries (4 items that cost me about 40 bucks as it were) I withdrew a one Satoshi balance from zapread.com.

I stood in the grocery line with a shit eating grin on my face not recognizing that the cashier was telling me to cough up my $40. As I inserted my card I realized that the act of receiving a single Satoshi was way more valuable than me purchasing my groceries (except for my my Mongo double IPAs, obviously).",1538703492,05/10/2018 01:38:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9li0yk/i_just_withdrew_1_satoshi_on_lnd/,1

Shower thought: Maybe Roger Ver really is Bitcoin Jesus?,"Maybe he is trying to teach the community the importance of decentralisation, the importance of off-chain scaling and that we shouldn‚Äôt blindly follow community leaders. Maybe he decided that now was a good time to teach the community a lesson by promoting his own shitcoin version of Bitcoin, splitting the community, having Bcash fail and in the process educate people before Bitcoin becomes mainstream. 

He knows he will get hated for it, but at the same time he knows he has to come across as genuine, otherwise people will still think they can trust ‚Äòauthoritative‚Äô figures in the community. 

In that sense he really would be sacrificing his reputation in order to inoculate us from the threat of naively following future leaders who try to gain control over Bitcoin.",1538709248,05/10/2018 03:14:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lip7j/shower_thought_maybe_roger_ver_really_is_bitcoin/,1

Sell the house and Crossing Borders with Bitcoin?,"Hi all,

So I'm planning on moving from USA to Germany next year. My plan is to sell the house (I'll have about 100k in gains) ship my stuff and go. I'd like to hear your opinions on how best to take those gains and either:

Accept partial payment in Bitcoin
Or Convert to Bitcoin here then cash out upon arrival in Germany

What should I look into to be able to cash out in Euro?
What considerations do I need to have upon doing so, compared to wiring myself the money?

I've gone as far as putting a couple grand into coin base and leaving it there... Not so versed as I'd need to be for such a big sum.

Settlement risk is one of the major issues in post-trading financial systems: the risk that one party in a transaction fails to deliver on its end of the deal. Currently, settlement risk is mitigated by central counterparties. They administer and guarantee the delivery of securities by the seller on the one hand, and receipt of the selling price in cash on the other hand. Settlement in seconds, without the risk of the other party not delivering in time, could be a promising future.

&gt;A third potential benefit is that blockchains can be designed so that the central bank or supervisor can see details of all transactions. This allows for regulatory supervision and oversight, which is needed for maintaining the high standards of integrity in the financial system. 

They already wanting to put their nose in.

&gt;But this is a major challenge for decentralized systems like DLT. Energy efficiency is still a problem too: there are estimates that the bitcoin mining network uses a a similar amount of energy as the whole of Ireland

They have to put in some energy negativity. Luckily for us that the current system is running on thin air.

&gt; For the moment however, we can only conclude that blockchain hasn‚Äôt led to any groundbreaking changes in the payments ecosystem. From a financial system perspective, the ‚Äòevolution of power‚Äô has not yet occurred. 

&gt;The word ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô implies money. Our understanding of money is something completely different. It is based on the three functions of money  ‚Äì as a means of payment, store of value, and unit of account. Even bitcoin, the most widely-recognised crypto, doesn‚Äôt fulfill these functions. It‚Äôs difficult to pay with it in a store, its value is undermined by its volatility, and it has no use as a unit of account. As it doesn‚Äôt meet these three criteria, we prefer to use the term crypto-asset or simply, crypto. 

Lets all improve this so that they can't deny that any longer!

&gt;Firstly, more widespread trading of cryptos may lead to reputational risks for financial institutions, and affect confidence. 

We have accomplish at least something already!",1538744973,05/10/2018 13:09:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lm4ur/the_evolution_of_power_of_blockhain_by_klaas/,1

# of Bitcoin Transactions/day and batching,"One metric I like to watch is the confirmed Bitcoin transactions per day. I get that info at this link. It's nice to see the numbers increasing these last few months.
https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions

My question is does batching change this metric in a meaningful way? 
I know when exchanges implemented batching last spring we saw fees drop drastically. So when an exchange starts batching transactions together does it decrease this metric of # of confirmed transactions on the blockchain?

Can someone clarify this a little?

A transaction is still a transaction whether its batched or not right? I'm not confident about this, and think lots of us could benefit from an ELI5.

PS This question was inspired by segwit transactions going above 50% for the first time ever yesterday. (Another metric I enjoy watching)

"u/Kain_niaK, I don't want your money.","Yesterday after the Charlie Lee and Roger Ver debate video came out u/Kain_niaK made a bet that I couldn't complete a lightning payment to one of the 4000 merchants that CoinGate enabled, if successful he would pay me 1 BCH. You can see our exchange here https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9ldi7t/roger_ver_debates_charlie_lee_the_lightning/e766136/. He lost. So far he has sent me around .1 BCH and has stated he will pay it in increments. I am here to let him and all others know I am forgiving his debt. If he wants move forward with payment thats on him but I am not interested in frivolously shaming and taking money from someone who needs it for his other real life obligations. $500 to me isnt easy to come by and I assume the same goes for him. I intend to return the money he already sent.  

The thing is we all know why we are here, aside for those looking to make a quick buck, and that‚Äôs to see the embodiment of real life sound liberating money. Something the world needs to move to the enlightenment of mankind. After watching his youtube videos at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLni7r-xOl68fPgmQEsAGAA the guy just seems like a normal dude who like all of us is exciting about this technology. u/Kain_niaK does'nt seem like an asshole and if he came off like a real arrogant rich twat like some in this space. If that were the case I would have no problem taking his money. He is a normal person who has struggles and finds enjoyment in certain things.  

u/Kain_niaK I am also a piano/keyboard player. In fact my that is one of my life‚Äôs greatest pleasures. My username CP70 is in fact a reference to the Yamaha CP70 electric piano. What say you that we put this behind us, be more open to our opposite communities and instead have a chat about our instruments and bands we enjoy? That is more interesting to me.

‚ÄùThe art world is similar to the rest of the economy,‚Äù Pascal said, adding that he sees it as an entity divided into two parts.

"MorphToken not crediting XMR , multiple times","I've done about 8 transactions through morphtoken : BTC &lt;---&gt; BCH , BTC &lt;---&gt; XMR , etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently though, the past few XMR transactions that i've done between XMR and BTC , Morphtoken just literally said they transferred and said the whole thing was completed. But even with the first transaction, the addresses were all right, everything was double checked, and written correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Go to my monero wallet, NO MONERO EVER deposited , in any of the addresses i've used . Its been about 2 weeks now since my first one went missing. Thought the server was just slow , but nope. This time i actually saved/screenshotted the transaction confirmation at the end.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/u/morphtokenx I do not need any of the PR responses as you ALWAYS seem to only give. I want a solution to this. 

If you dont want negative social media posts like you've stated in a previous post , don't give people a reason to put you in the spotlight . You're trying to hide the problem , whats the reason for trying to HIDE it INSTEAD of FIXING it?

The XMR bug was ""fixed"" on your website about a month or two ago so it doesn't explain anything.

If it's because my IP was flagged for USING A VPN , you should realize that 99% of your transactions are very likely NORMAL transactions . VPN's are extremely common nowadays . Many people use them. IP addresses should not be a flag by itself because its  not identifiable at all. I bet my transactions didn't go through because of the system logging my IP , flags my transactions, then you just keep my money and say ""we're investigating you, no real reasoning behind it but you MAYBE ,  POSSIBLY , COULD HAVE and MIGHT HAVE even the smallest connection to this address thats been flagged so we will be keeping your money forever"". Great service provided here...

&amp;#x200B;

If you really need to investigate these transactions this carefully , ill gladly give you my wallet address , XMR view key, EVERYTHING . To anyone actually , if you want proof yourself that they are holding funds at random , indefinitely , without any way to get it back after the transactions been completed.

&amp;#x200B;

This is blatant theft , keeping our BTC indefinitely with no reasoning or warnings behind it , and no way to check after the transaction if it really did process or not.

Bitcoin selling/trading question on Localbitcoin/Paxful...,"Hi,

So I want to start selling/trading Bitcoin on Paxful or Localbitcoin...I don't really want to make TOO much profit...just as a little side income...however...
I'm reading that I need a money transmitters license to do this?
I've read into that, but it's really expensive to get that license and complicated too...
Anyone do alot of trading on local or paxful?
Like...what profit margin per month am I looking at to actually use the money transmitters license?
I've tried googling this information...but it was no help. All that kept showing up were some florida men that got arrested for trying to buy credit card #s with their sales.",1538760302,05/10/2018 17:25:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lobcl/bitcoin_sellingtrading_question_on/,1

Venezuela to Release its Own Cryptocurrency Petro,"On October 1st, the Venezuelan government announced the official date for Petro cryptocurrency release into the market. The crypto is developed and controlled by the authorities, with the coin pegged to the country's oil value. 

r/https://www.ccn.com/public-sale-of-venezuelas-state-crypto-petro-to-commence-on-november-5/

However, the announcement came with many critics, both domestic and foreign-based. The opposition, general crypto community and experts in the financial fields expressed their doubts whether this new measure will help the government to control hyperinflation Bolivar. 

It remains to be seen how the market will react and whether the 110 million worth of supply will help Venezuelan economy to recover. 

In the meantime, U.S. will not sit by idly, with President Trump already ordering domestic exchanges not to accept the said crypto.

Encrybit is coming with the chat room to chat in real-time at token/coin-specific groups with cryptocurrency experts," Communication is a great way to express thoughts and ask questions. At Encrybit exchange the chat is an instrument to communicate with others in different groups discussing coins/tokens fundamentals and technical aspects along with the on-going news. Expert traders can share their views on coins/tokens based on their technical analysis and share it in a specified group to discuss it, therefore, others can view it and interact with each other. In the initial stage Encrybit will manage the chat groups but in later stages, Encrybit will appoint a community of active and selected traders from the exchange's users to moderate and create groups. Only a certain level of traders will get the opportunity to manage a chat room. Encrybit is planning to create token/coin specific chat groups to avoid confusion and difficulties reading the mixed content. In the chat group, users will be able to share their thoughts in form of screenshots or texts.

Like BTCPayServer but with payroll?,"From working at a startup I know first-hand the troubles of getting payroll setup. We‚Äôve been using a company called Paychex which has managed to eff up our payroll almost every pay period. To add to the fun, once you remind the company they screwed up, you have to wait an additional week for the bank to actually give you your money. 

I love how BTCPayServer is so powerful, but super easy, and allows payments directly into your own secured wallet and not some web wallet. 

If I was the business owner I would love if I could keep all the payroll money on a Ledger or something, and then once a pay period, view all the salaries, click send and watch all my employees get paid. This would be so much better than dealing with some bullshit company who charges for the pleasure of doing this simple task. 

I know this system would have to do withholdings for taxes and whatever else. Can‚Äôt wait for the hyperbitcoin future!",1538778852,05/10/2018 22:34:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lr0e0/like_btcpayserver_but_with_payroll/,1

I almost wanted to send her some Nno or litcoin (cant post the names on reddit...) Will LN and or atomics swaps be on time? What do you guys realistically think. 

I see all the positive sides of BTC vs altcoins. But this slow conformation time thing is just really annoying. Also she told me: I have to pay 39 cents to send some?!

"Is a ""half bitcoin, half ETF"" investment a good alternative to real estate for millenials and Gen Z?","I am in my thirties now so I am more of an elder millenial. I've been buying bitcoin and dogecoin regularly since 2014 and still do. I have also been investing in high dividend ETFs for a decade. The ETFs provide passive dividend income that I fully live off and the crypto has provided and continues to provide high long-term growth. I don't own any real estate and have no home, usually living with housemates if I can find a good deal otherwise I live with my parents. 

In my twenties I was very conscious of the environment, so I didn't buy a house, I committed to being childfree for life, I ride a bike or take public transport, and I don't eat meat. I am still environmentally conscious but have discovered that these lifestyle changes are not just good for the environment but also make you healthy and wealthy. It is as if right makes might.

I see many millenials complain about being priced out of real estate, but I think they have been brainwashed into walking down a path that will lead to debt slavery. The standard lifescript of getting married, buying a huge house financed with a massive bank mortgage, and then having children leads to considerable consumption and debt. Banks and government generate fiat money out of thin air and then charge interest on it effectively enslaving the world.

If you live with parents/housemates, ride a bike and/or take public transport, never have children, and invest half in crypto and half in high dividend ETFs all while minimizing or eliminating debt and obligation, this is an easy path to financial freedom. The crypto gives you huge capital gains while the ETFs give you passive dividend income, which provides financial freedom.

"My Bitcoin T.A. For Friday, Oct. 5th","Not really a technical analysis, I‚Äôm not going to bother to analyze the dormant Bitcoin activity lately. Obviously, everyone is aware that the stock market had a rough day and week. I think it will continue to descend into next week and the last 2-3 hours of recovery was only to blind dubious investors. So, why is this pertinent to Bitcoin and the crypto market? Because I believe it completely the lack of activity this past week with some of the most minor fluctuations we‚Äôve seen in a whole. Bitcoin and the crypto market is quiet, too quiet. Why?  Because the whales who are the market movers are trying to gauge and ascertain the stock market since they understand that can significantly impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price. The whales are not budging because this is a rare occasion for them where they are dealing with FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Of course, their FUD is not related to Bitcoin or the crypto market but the stock market. As soon as the whales and all of us get a better read on what will happen to the stock market, the whales and the crypto will react.  I cannot EMPHASIZE enough the importance of the economy and the stock market on Bitcoin. Though the whales have a stronghold on Bitcoin‚Äôs price, they are smalltime when it comes to global stock markets especially America‚Äôs stock market for several reasons. (1) Bitcoin is their bread and butter and the easiest source of long term wealth for them. (2) Assets in global stock markets and commodities completely dwarf the crypto market. The whales might look rich in Bitcoin but they are relatively poor in other asset classes. So, what do I expect to happen this weekend with the crypto market? Nothing. I think we might see a minor price drop (like Bitcoin falling to $6500 - it currently stands $6600). But, certainly nothing extreme until the whales resolve their FUD next week. That‚Äôs why today was one of the quietest Fridays in over a year.

We crash from here....right now.,"It is no secret that btc is approaching the end of descending triangle which has been forming ever since we topped out many months ago.....I think its safe to say that most of us are aware that some sort of major event will happen once we break out in either direction......so really, the only thing that nobody knows (including me) is which way it will break when it occurs.

I am tying to show why I think the break will be to the downside.

There are a handful of timeframes which one can use to come to this conclusion, but take a look at the two hour chart. I believe it offers us an accurate representation of the overall strength of bitcoin at this time.

Bitcoin has put in a triple top, with each of these moves showing that it is weakening in strength.

Sept 21-22 the 2 hour RSI managed to top out at an RSI of 80ish

Sept 27-28 the second top was put in with an RSI that only managed to get up to approximately 73 without taking out the previous high.

Yesterday-the third top was put in with an RSI that only managed to poke its nose into overbought territory for a very short amount of time with a high of 61ish.

So...obviously nobody can say for sure, but I believe the break will be to the down side since to me it appears we have bitcoin completing a triple top which appears to be weakening in each of the three moves upwards.

To top it off, during this triple top rally (not really a true rally...but for lack of a better word describing a temporary upward trend), bitcoin on a daily basis was never able to get the daily RSI able the zero point. I think most technical traders can appreciate this danger without me explaining it.

Maybe its minutes from now, or maybe hours....but I believe that we crash from here. Best of luck to all traders.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/fidelity-is-thriving-heres-what-it-needs-to-keep-thriving-1538786334?mod=hp_LEAD_1,"Fidelity has more assets than any other financial services company.  Here are their plans for Bitcoin.   This is from today‚Äôs interview with Fidelity‚Äôs CEO and Chairwoman, Abby Johnson in the Barron‚Äôs newspaper.  

‚ÄúFidelity spends $2.5 billion a year on technology, with a workforce of ‚Äú10,000 technologists around the globe.‚Äù The results aren‚Äôt apparent in whiz-bang features like virtual-reality tools or computer-generated financial advisors‚Äîyet. But it drives down operating costs and pays off in the background. Many registered investment advisors choose to custody assets with Fidelity because its platform works so well, says Lowell. Fidelity isn‚Äôt a tech disrupter, he adds, but ‚Äúamong the major financial houses, it‚Äôs one of the most tech-oriented and progressive.‚Äù

Fidelity develops much of its own financial tools, apps, and trading technology in its incubator, Fidelity Labs. On a recent visit to the Labs, the firm showed off augmented-reality goggles that it‚Äôs developing for 3-D charting. A team was working on a Bitcoin service (tightly under wraps) that Johnson says she ‚Äúhopes to have commercially available by the end of the year.‚Äù

If Fidelity does launch a digital-coin exchange, it would, as is often the case, not be the first. In February, Robinhood started offering commission-free trading in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, now allowed in the 17 states. An exchange called ErisX, backed by TD Ameritrade Holding (AMTD) and Virtu Financial (VIRT), recently announced plans to trade digital currencies and related derivatives. ETFs may be coming soon: The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to approve nine Bitcoin-related ETFs over the next few months.

Fidelity investors can see Coinbase balances on Fidelity.com and donate digital currency to the Fidelity Charitable Donor-Advised Fund. And the firm is experimenting internally. Some company cafeterias accept Bitcoin as payment, and a Bit &amp; Blocks club (2,600 members connected with Fidelity‚Äôs blockchain incubator) sponsors an annual Crypto-Asset Portfolio Challenge for employees (using hypothetical currencies).

One thing Fidelity learned? Hardly anyone uses Bitcoin to buy lunch because the currency could appreciate so fast that a pizza could end up costing the equivalent of $50 by the time you‚Äôve finished eating. The firm also found out how easy it is for computerized cryptocurrency traders to beat people: Indian programmers developed trading bots for the in-house contest, prompting Fidelity to put constraints on the strategy.

Bitcoin, says Abby, is an ‚Äúextracurricular activity for me.‚Äù But she‚Äôs well versed in the lingo. ‚ÄúYou start hashing the blocks and hope to hit one first, which is when you mine your coins,‚Äù she says, describing the mining operation. Fidelity dipped into mining Bitcoin, through a small venture launched in 2015. ‚ÄúThis was Fidelity writing a check to buy a bunch of computer equipment,‚Äù says Johnson. ‚ÄúWe expected to lose money on it. But we were making ridiculous amounts of money at the peak.‚Äù Fidelity is exploring more ‚Äúuse cases‚Äù for Bitcoin, she adds, while waiting for federal regulators to issue more trading, tax, and anti-money-laundering rules.‚Äù",1538841778,06/10/2018 16:02:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lx1ey/httpswwwbarronscomarticlesfidelityisthrivingheresw/,1

From Barron‚Äôs Newspaper, October 6 2018","‚ÄúFidelity spends $2.5 billion a year on technology, with a workforce of ‚Äú10,000 technologists around the globe.‚Äù The results aren‚Äôt apparent in whiz-bang features like virtual-reality tools or computer-generated financial advisors‚Äîyet. But it drives down operating costs and pays off in the background. Many registered investment advisors choose to custody assets with Fidelity because its platform works so well, says Lowell. Fidelity isn‚Äôt a tech disrupter, he adds, but ‚Äúamong the major financial houses, it‚Äôs one of the most tech-oriented and progressive.‚Äù

Fidelity develops much of its own financial tools, apps, and trading technology in its incubator, Fidelity Labs. On a recent visit to the Labs, the firm showed off augmented-reality goggles that it‚Äôs developing for 3-D charting. A team was working on a Bitcoin service (tightly under wraps) that Johnson says she ‚Äúhopes to have commercially available by the end of the year.‚Äù

If Fidelity does launch a digital-coin exchange, it would, as is often the case, not be the first. In February, Robinhood started offering commission-free trading in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, now allowed in the 17 states. An exchange called ErisX, backed by TD Ameritrade Holding (AMTD) and Virtu Financial (VIRT), recently announced plans to trade digital currencies and related derivatives. ETFs may be coming soon: The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to approve nine Bitcoin-related ETFs over the next few months.

Fidelity investors can see Coinbase balances on Fidelity.com and donate digital currency to the Fidelity Charitable Donor-Advised Fund. And the firm is experimenting internally. Some company cafeterias accept Bitcoin as payment, and a Bit &amp; Blocks club (2,600 members connected with Fidelity‚Äôs blockchain incubator) sponsors an annual Crypto-Asset Portfolio Challenge for employees (using hypothetical currencies).

One thing Fidelity learned? Hardly anyone uses Bitcoin to buy lunch because the currency could appreciate so fast that a pizza could end up costing the equivalent of $50 by the time you‚Äôve finished eating. The firm also found out how easy it is for computerized cryptocurrency traders to beat people: Indian programmers developed trading bots for the in-house contest, prompting Fidelity to put constraints on the strategy.

Bitcoin, says Abby, is an ‚Äúextracurricular activity for me.‚Äù But she‚Äôs well versed in the lingo. ‚ÄúYou start hashing the blocks and hope to hit one first, which is when you mine your coins,‚Äù she says, describing the mining operation. Fidelity dipped into mining Bitcoin, through a small venture launched in 2015. ‚ÄúThis was Fidelity writing a check to buy a bunch of computer equipment,‚Äù says Johnson. ‚ÄúWe expected to lose money on it. But we were making ridiculous amounts of money at the peak.‚Äù Fidelity is exploring more ‚Äúuse cases‚Äù for Bitcoin, she adds, while waiting for federal regulators to issue more trading, tax, and anti-money-laundering rules.‚Äù",1538842038,06/10/2018 16:07:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lx2o1/fidelity_ceos_comments_regarding_bitcoin_from/,1
Research about the most relevant determinants in cryptocurrency adoption.,"Hi everyone,

We are a research team from the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL), in Portugal, and during the last weeks we‚Äôve been collecting responses to our questionnaire but still need 40 more answers to achieve the 200 target.

Here is the link if you want to contribute, it takes on average 3 minutes: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies\_usage](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cryptocurrencies_usage)

The detailed results with infographics and the most important conclusions of the study will be published by the end of October (estimation).

More details if you want to read:

Regarding the construction of the questionnaire, it was based on Likert type scale questions. We considered 10 different dimensions, from perceived usefulness to privacy to profitability, among others. It has some focus on the financial area, but this does not mean it is the most important. We know there are some other dimensions not being addressed in this questionnaire, such as decentralisation/government influence, that may be addressed in the future.

Your input is really important for this research and to help us and other researchers boost academic knowledge in this area.

There are no open questions, but you can message me or post in the comments if you feel so. 

Thank you all for your participation!",1538842491,06/10/2018 16:14:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9lx4te/research_about_the_most_relevant_determinants_in/,1

What sets apart a mediocre exchange and a good exchange?,"Consultant hq:
Just like all commodities, we need good platforms to trade our crypto assets, the price and volume are going to fluctuate at times. Sometimes, prices go up within a second and you find yourself stacked to trade your assets due to complications within some exchanges. As an investor I would evaluate exchanges based on the protocol and what they're accomplishing with their platform. Are they user-friendly? Can I get help whenever needed? Are they secure enough ? Do they have solid team? Those are the types of fundamentals I'd like to see in exchanges before starting to trade; demand and volume and the rest can follow.

Empty blocks are good for the Bitcoin Network as they make it more decentralized,"There was a recent panic over a certain mining pool producing an unusually high amount of empty blocks.  People were saying that this was an attack on the network, in some way, because it drives up fees.  


I think that people are looking a gift horse in the mouth.  If X% of the network is empty blocks, this is equivelant to an X% blocksize decrease.  


And as we know from what happened during the blocksize debate last year, smaller blocks are good for the network.  They reduce the cost of running your own node, and make it more decentralized.  And big blocks on the other hand, and non empty blocks, increase the cost of running your own node.  This makes the network centralized, and can have catastrophic effects on the network!  


Therefore, we should actually be encouraging miners to produce more empty blocks, or smaller blocks, and we should be encouraging fees to go up.  Fees are what makes the bitcoin network run, and the higher that fees are, the more secure it is.  Everyone who is interested in lower fees should just go use the lightning network.",1538886647,07/10/2018 04:30:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9m2jch/empty_blocks_are_good_for_the_bitcoin_network_as/,1

What sets apart a good exchange from a scammy one?,"Just like all commodities, we need good platforms to trade our crypto assets. Sometimes, prices go up within a second and you find yourself stuck when trying to trade your assets due to complications within some exchanges.

As an investor, I evaluate exchanges based on their protocol and what they're accomplishing with their platform.

\- Are they user-friendly?

\- Can I get help whenever needed?

\- Are they secure enough?

\- Do they have a solid team?

Here are some of the exchanges I trade at:

**Bittrex**: It‚Äôs one of the safest exchanges in my opinion. But because I am on mobile, the user experience is not so solid.  it‚Äôis a US-based exchange headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It‚Äôs been around since 2013 It was funded by 2 ex Microsoft employees.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Gate io**: I used to trade on Gate, but recently, they canned Canadians so, that‚Äôs out.Not much is available about  the team. What I liked about Gate is that it is secure, mobile friendly and intuitive. The thing is Gate was named by SEC, in the list of crypto exchanges under investigation. Along wth Binance. This raises big alarms. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Binance**: I don‚Äôt think much is to be said about Binance. In addition to the excellent user experience, mobile friendlines, high liquity, technically sound team, one thing Binance has that I have not seen with other exchanges is their community. If you have been on telegram, you know what I mean. I also like that  they are planninhg to go decentralized soon. Rumor has it that plans for beta testing of the DEX is coming in 2019. 

&amp;#x200B;

**KubitX**: This one is a new exchange that I have come across,  it is an up and coming exchange growing out of Africa. They are serious contanders for the fastest exchange. Their exchange will be able to proces over 12,000,000 trades per second, which should make it the fastest exchange out there, 

&amp;#x200B;

What sets them part is how they are going about acquiring their user base. They are going on the ground WIth their Global channel ambassador (GCA) program, they have a locally based rep in every country in Africa, and each GCA works with channel ambassadors to bring awareness about blockchain technology even to remote locations. They are going after Africa because it is under served when it comes to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Their CAs and GCAs are holding meetings and discussing cryptocurrencies and blockchain in their native tongues. They seem to be really pushing the barrier of what it means to do drive adopton and financial integration.  I think it has the opportunity to be a top exchange if they can pull it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorta like what Binance was to China during the crypto crackdown of 2017.

If you remember, Binance was basically the only exchange that didn't get shut down at the time and this helped them become the giant that they are today.

I see many parallels between Binance and Kubitx in that sense. Africa is looking like it‚Äôs going to be the next giant to enter the blockchain space. Kubitx's strategy of working with locally situated representatives to promote blockchain education and user adoption could be key to help them hold a monopoly in the African market.

&amp;#x200B;

They did a private sale recently and today they have announced that their beta is ready for testing. They are looking for [testers.You](https://testers.You) can read more about that in the link below, if you want to check them about.

I know this is my opinion only, I would like to know, what about you guys?

My idea - need input,"I really need input. What do you guys think of this?

Business Page: The Block Game

idea:
We create a video website where we integrate money and cryptocurrency with a block game.

The game:
I call the game for the Blockgame. In the block game there is a block. In the blocks we deposit money. Solving a block, a person gets the money. The algorithm on the website will make it free, easy and safe for everyone to solve a block.

To solve the blocks, people must click on ""want to play"". When they click on ""want to play"", advertisements appear. People chase a code at the end of the advertisement. If there is a code, you enter the code on the block to solve it.

Our algorithm will allow new blocks to be created as soon as we earn 1 crown in advertising. 
Just like the big websites like Youtube, Google and Facebook, we'll rely on advertising. Of all revenues, 90% will go to the company's costs. The remaining 10% will go to creating new blocks.
The algorithm will enable people to win money constantly, 24/7.

Here's how to do it step by step.
1. We create a new cryptocurrency. We take 100 trillions ""coins"" for ourselves. There is no limit to how much we can take. We will keep these ""coins"". We will also share them free to people who register on the website. People should have cryptocurrency, that is where value comes in.
1 coin = 0 crowns. It is this value we will influence. The intention is to get our coins to increase in value as much as possible.
2. We create a video homepage. We integrate cryptovalutors by watching videos.
3. When we earned $ 10, 10% of them go to a block. In the blocks there are 1 crown and 1 of our own cryptovaluta.
4. People solve blocks = they get money + our cryptocurrency.
5. We make it easy for people to ""mine"" our currencies. This means that people can get our currencies free of charge. You should be able to transfer these to the website.
6. Then I have ideas on how to continue developing the website, including buying, selling, trading (in our coin), mortgage, other types of games (chess, tetris, four in a row, etc) where achivement is achieved through to invest coins in it, betting, selling things with a 3D printer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The algorithm of the ""block game""

Here is an example of how the block game works. It's an algorithm:
We will make money on advertising / ads that people want to look at.

1. A creator uploads a video.
2. Before the video, we have advertising (as on youtube).
3. People watch the video.
4. After the video, we have advertising (as on youtube)
5. We make money on the advertisement.
6. Every time we earn $ 10 on the advertisement, we take 90% of them. These 90% will cover all our costs. We integrate the remaining 10% of advertising revenue (1 crown) into a block game. When the advertisement has deposited 1 crown to the block game, one block is ready to be resolved.
7. In each block there is 1 crown and 1 of our own cryptocurrency.
8. Under the videopage, next to the block is a tag called ""want to play"". When you click on the ""want to play"" tag, a new page will open.
9. On the new page you can ""play"". When you click on ""play"" an ad / advertisement pops up. At the end of the advertisement there is a code if you have won. There is no code, no one won.
10. The person enters the code on the block and then solves the block.
11. The money and cryptocurrency are transferred to the person's wallet / page on the website.
12. As soon as we earn 1 crown from the advertisement the algorithm make it possible to create new blocks of money .
13. Then everything continues to go around. As soon as we have received 1 krona for a new block, new blocks will be created
14. How fast new blocks are created depends on how many views a video gets.
15. On the new page there is a diagram. The diagram shows information about how the block chain looks. How many blocks were created, resolved, when someone won last, who won last, how much someone won, how many wins on average per minute / hour / day.
16. In the diagram we are transparent. We write in the chart when someone won a block at the latest (time). We do not need to write with how many click ""want to play"" is needed to solve a block(hashpower). People watch advertisements and compete against each other (mining).
17. Transparency - People will be able to see who wins. Everyone has their own profile on our website.

I call these blocks for the ""creator's block"". Creator blocks can create creator at any time. This to earn money from his work. We will have a chart showing how many ""creator blocks"" were created and in which block numbers they will come in. This is to be transparent to users who want to play and win. They act as regular blocks but give the creator 10 crowns and 10 coins. They work in the same way as regular blocks but are placed in number order. Which blocks it will be on the chart.
For example:
Block 1 will be a creator's block
Block 8 will be the creator's block
Block 19 will be the creator's block
etc.
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ------------------
Conclusion:
We have created a video website just like Youtube. We rely on advertising to be able to exist. 90% of revenue goes to the company's costs. 10% to a block game.We have an algorithm that allows us to spend money in blocks.

On the website, the block game is a block chain with different blocks that are created as soon as we earn 1 crown to one block. The blocks are solved by checking on advertising. The blocks are solved when someone gets a code at the end of the commercial. We make money from people watching advertising and trying to solve the different blocks
We have an algorithm that allows to constantly create new blocks that people try to solve. This as soon as we earn 1 crown in advertising revenue.",1538917883,07/10/2018 13:11:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9m4xef/my_idea_need_input/,1

Bitcoin Hits Inflection Point With Volatility at 17-Month Low,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Is this the start of a new phase for Bitcoin or the beginning of the end for the biggest cryptocurrency?](https://i.redd.it/43qfou3m2sq11.jpg)

That seems to be the question being pondered by both proponents and skeptics with volatility lingering at the lowest level since before the epic surge and collapse of the peer-to-peer electronic alternative to cash.

Those looking for some guidance from historical pricing patterns are out of luck. Neither a strong positive or negative divergence has formed over the past month, technical analysis measures show. Bitcoin traded in a similar pattern only one other time this year ‚Äî in June, when its price jumped from around $5,900 to around $8,200.

Bitcoin is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. But it took...

What does Bitcoin Price and Volume teach us about the Kavanaugh Nomination and Confirmation: PLENTY!,"Kavanaugh

Nominated: July 10th: BTC Price  $6277-6683 Volume: 470,432,142

Confirmed: October 6th: BTC Price $6535-6599 Volume: 105,309,328

Gorsuch

Nominated February 1, 2017: BTC Price $959-986 Volume 44,035,816

Confirmed: April 7th, 2017: BTC Price $1173-1201 Volume: 71,184,485

We can see from the most recent Supreme Court Nominations and confirmations that there is an inversion on volume between date nominated and confirmed. On one hand, the day Kavanaugh was confirmed the volume was 4 times less then the day he was nominated. In terms of Gorsuch, the volume is on a upward trend from the day of nomination to the day of confirmation.

Conclusions: From a data point, we would have to go back further and see what other trends were taking place on those dates, but I believe that we can conclude that there was not a economic panic unlike the political hysteria  with the nomination and fight over Kavanaugh. While political money was spent to fight the confirmation, real money (as seen through volume) was inverse to panic. The swing between low and high price was also less then on his date of nomination. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for Gorsuch, i think that since we can see a logical progression of price and volume, that there was neither a panic nor a spike due to his nomination or confirmation.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, while the noise may be saying one thing,  following of  money will always tell you the truth.",1538925724,07/10/2018 15:22:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9m5tjr/what_does_bitcoin_price_and_volume_teach_us_about/,1

Earn Bitcoin Daily for free,"Hi‚Ä¶ What I believe is ‚ÄúAs long as any Platform is paying it‚Äôs GENUINE. The moment it stops paying, it turns out to be FAKE / SCAM‚Äù.

The point here is, On the website of Pivot App, they are claiming that a lot of money has been invested by big Companies like

Binance Labs
Huobi
LD Capital
INBlockchain
Link VC.
So, right t this point you can‚Äôt say that Pivot is SCAM, because they are paying without any issue.

You can earn money from Pivot App in three ways:

By Inviting Friends to Join and use the App (10,000 Power)
By Reading a POST (100 Power) (Maximum 20 Posts per day. i.e. max 2,000 Power per day by reading posts)
Invite Bonus. (You'll be given 10% Power bonus of all your Friends whom you refer)
My personal experience:

I gathered 2,000 powers by Reading posts‚Ä¶ and I got 0.05 USD (Five cents) for 2000 Powers. Again on the second day I got five cents for gathering 2,000 powers.

Can you really earn money from Pivot App?

Yes... Certainly. But of course...

If you have a very good and big network. If you have the ability to get decent number of people joined through your referral link.
And if your Posts get excellent engagement, shares, up-votes, comments then you can earn a fair amount of money from the App.
I‚Äôve seen many people having a big network are earning decent amount from Pivot App.

But, One point is very clear that since 4 BTC is distributed everyday among all the users, so MORE user joining and using Pivot App everyday, the amount of money being received by each individual user is getting LESSER day by day.

I‚Äôve written a detailed blog post on this subject HERE I hope it will definitely help to understand the concept of PIVOT APP.",1538946677,07/10/2018 21:11:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9m8sdp/earn_bitcoin_daily_for_free/,1

"If Amazon adopts Bitcoin payment, what their customer operation should be ?","If Amazon accept Bitcoin payment for completely trustless payment, what should they do for their operation? I think this will be more inconvenient.

1. User send bitcoin to bitcoin address of Amazon.
2. Amazon takes a look their own address, and confirm successful payment.
3. Amazon send user his goods.

I think it's very inconvenient for some reasons below.

1. Amazon has to identify user's Bitcoin address. If user send bitcoin from his address that is not registered on Amazon, they have to check by human.
2. Bitcoin blockchain doesn't interact with centralized server. So Amazon can't receive digital sign that say ""you can send goods"" when user's bitcoin arrives Amazon's address. So they have to check by human.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi for protecting merchants from payment uncertainty, but it's more inconvenient in fact?

My experience paying with bitcoin at Bic Camera in Tokyo: A cautionary tale.,"Whenever I travel I like to visit bitcoin-accepting places to see how things work and keep an eye on physical world adoption. Bic Camera is one of the biggest retailers to accept bitcoin, so obviously I had to check it out.

&amp;#x200B;

So I walked to the cashier and told the guy I wanted to pay with bitcoin. He said ok and then spoke Japanese on the phone for a few minutes. My Japanese sucks, so I can only guess what that was about, but it seemed like he had no clue how to do it and was getting trained over the phone on how to accept btc payments. He went through a bunch of paper manuals and after a few minutes of waiting he finally started tapping something on a phone near the register. About 5 minutes in and I finally see a familar QR code with a btc address below it. I whip out my phone, samourai-style and happily pay the amount. Something happened on the screen and the guy picked up the phone again and started talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few more minutes pass, he looks at my phone's screen, then asks me to talk to someone on the phone in English. A woman asks if I have a transaction on my phone. At that point I was worried they're gonna wait for a block confirmation or something, but I got lucky anyways and had like 2 confirmations by that time, so all seemed ok. The woman asks if I have the transaction on my phone. I confirmed and handed the phone back to the guy.

&amp;#x200B;

He asks me to wait a little longer, and starts calling more people. Turns out BitFlyer (their payment processor) screwed up and the transaction doesn't show up as confirmed. About 20 minutes in the guy invites to me to sit while they figure it out. Another guy comes to help and then they proceed to spend another 20 minutes talking on the phone, handing the phone over to me every now and then to answer some lame questions. The woman on the phone had absolutely no clue what she was doing. She asked me twice if I had a BitFlyer account.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at 5 confirmations already and it turns out BitFlyer cannot verify if my transaction went through, because their support wasn't available anymore on that day and they ask me if I want to pay again with credit card, which I obviously refused. I asked if I can come back the next day once they sort this out, but they somehow avoided a direct answer to that question and asked for my email address. They told me someone from BitFlyer would contact me and do a refund.

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote down my email address on a piece of paper, then they proceeded to spell it out to check if they got it right. I wrote my email all caps to make it more readable and avoid any mistakes. Then they called some woman again and started spelling out the address to her over the phone, twice, which took several more minutes. The woman on the phone asked me twice if my email address should be lower or uppercase, which I said makes no difference at all, but they could use lowercase if they wanted to. After a few more minutes they call again to ask the exact same question...

&amp;#x200B;

And then, after sitting there for about an hour, I get an email from BitFlyer support (!!!) via Zendesk asking if this is the correct email address....

&amp;#x200B;

There were many more disturbing little things going on there, but I don't want to get into too much details. The BitFlyer PoS was web-based, barely working and complete trash. They're support couldn't check a transaction, but was somehow able to instantly contact me via email. Now they're saying they need several days to verify and process my refund. BitFlyer has been around for a while, got $36m in funding and they still can't the most basic on-chain transactions working.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've spent over an hour at Bic Camera dealing with this bullcrap, did not succeed in actually purchasing anything and my btc is locked at some shitty payment processor.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR\*\* Went to Bic Camera to buy stuff with bitcoin via BitFlyer; wasted over an hour of my life, failed to buy anything, my bitcoin is being held by BitFlyer; conclusion - avoid BitFlyer at all costs.",1538992933,08/10/2018 10:02:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mdjxn/my_experience_paying_with_bitcoin_at_bic_camera/,1

"Why Bitcoin (BTC) Can‚Äôt Fall Below $5,800","&amp;#x200B;

[Weekly Chart for BTC\/USD](https://i.redd.it/ltk92w386zq11.png)

Bitcoin (BTC) cannot fall below $5,800. There, I said it. It might not be possible to say what price Bitcoin (BTC) might reach by the end of the year. That is because one will have to speculate. However, to see if Bitcoin (BTC) can fall below a certain level, there is no need for speculation. We have plenty of historical data to base our analysis on. There are two straightforward charts that form the basis of this analysis. The first chart is the above weekly chart for [BTC/USD](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/). The two lines drawn on the chart form part of the hypothesis that Bitcoin (BTC) cannot fall below $5,800. Later in this analysis we will test this hypothesis, but first let us examine it in detail.

The yellow line on the chart was once a critical support for Bitcoin (BTC) in 2014. Bitcoin (BTC) broke this support and plunged below it. As a result, this support turned into a resistance. As, we can see Bitcoin (BTC) bumped into this resistance around $20,000 and declined steadily afterwards. This establishes the significance of historical levels. Anyone with access to a Bitcoin (BTC) chart could have seen the price topping out at $20,000. Now, why did this support (yellow line) turn into a resistance? As we can see, Bitcoin (BTC) tested this support a number of times and it held. However, when it broke, it was a major blow to bullish sentiment and thus the support turned into resistance. The price never managed to break above it during its next cycle.

By the same logic, let us now analyze the white line. The white line served as an important resistance to Bitcoin (BTC). As we can see, this resistance was tested multiple times and it held. It was tested once in 2015, twice in 2016 and then twice in 2017. During its second retest in May 2017, Bitcoin (BTC) broke through this resistance and rallied higher. This was a major blow to bearish sentiment and thus the resistance turned into a support. Bitcoin (BTC) cannot break below this support.

ELI5 STONEWALL transactions,"As I understand STONEWALL is a privacy feature for Bitcoin transactions, and on some wallets is now running automatically as the default setting. Does it work well? Was this part of a BIP? Is it used by multiple wallets or just Samurai?

How does it compare to something like Schnorr or Dandelion?
Does it have a  significant downside? Is there a reason people should deactivate STONEWALL transactions in the wallets settings? (Maybe it makes the transactions larger and fills up the mempool faster)

Maybe it's great, maybe it's just nice catchy marketing...I genuinely dont know but I want to learn.

Thanks, below is a copy and paste about what STONEWALL is from the Samurai Wallet site, and the link I got it from.

As such, we are retiring BIP126 from Samourai Wallet and we are happy to introduce STONEWALL in replacement.. STONEWALL is a new send type available at no extra charge to all Samourai users, enabled by default - it can be disabled in the Transaction Settings. Whenever possible your wallet will create transactions that simulates a CoinJoin transaction and obtains a Boltzmann score greater than 0. Transactions will appear on the blockchain as if there are multiple unrelated counterparties involved. STONEWALL improves on BIP126 in a number of ways. Primarily, STONEWALL activates more frequently than BIP126 did, meaningore of your transactions will benefit from this type of protection. Additionally, the entropy of STONEWALL transactions have been consistently higher than BIP126 transactions during our testing. Specific STONEWALL Algorithm information can be¬†

[Question] Bitcoin and Possible Outer Economic Forces in the Future?,"Hi,

So I have been reading and learning a lot about Bitcoin: from the idea, concept perspective as well as from technical and bigger picture aspect. At the moment I am learning the technical aspect of it. I am a nerd. 

I have tried to teach people not only to test my own knowledge but also to try explain why Bitcoin is important. However, there are things that I do not understand that mainly refer to the future than the present I think.

1. So let's imagine Bitcoin is a widely spread protocol in everyday life. So hidden and normal that we don't think about, as if we were in an aquarium and we don't think about water. Just like internet is right now. What kind of economic impact would Bitcoin have on our society, economy and in all important things that money affects? I am talking only of Bitcoin and the Money aspect, not blockchain nor other cryptocurrency mania.

2. The second question is without the query --- why,how,when,what --- because I do not know how to put it. So let's imagine banks are not used anymore as much (due to new infrastructure of money), but they print money --- business as usual --- and they exchange it to Bitcoin, what will happen to the Bitcoin's price, economy etc. Isn't it like ""printing"" Bitcoin artificially? I must be missing something crucial here. I feel like they are pumping fake money into Bitcoin ecosystem: like what is the effect of such action and is that possible in the future, and/or maybe we are witnessing it already? 

3. What economical problems could Bitcoin show in the future like FIAT does now? For example, inflation of Euro (I don't even know if it is ""bad or good"") Bitcoin is deflationary in nature, so how does that affect the economy of things in the grand scheme of things? I would like to hear the middle path, not an extreme view e.g. everybody will hodl Bitcoin and nobody uses it.

4. Countries that face hyperinflation (or similar) at the moment turn into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and other known ones. For example, Venezuela, Turkey and Argentina (plus Cyprus and Russia with their own set of problems). Can Bitcoin be a victim of such economic forces in the future and what kind of forces are those? This is actually my main question, which I just realized while typing it now.... So what kind of forces (economic and other etc.) could Bitcoin face in the future or does right now?

I haven't really delved into that area just yet. It is uncharted territory for me. I suppose the answers for questions are speculation since Bitcoin is still very much speculation and an experiment, albeit a working product that is indeed ""a living"" thing that encapsulates a lot of things in itself.

Thank you so much for reading and giving me your answers! I appreciate your time a lot for reading and answering!

Bitcoin and the post-scarcity society,"Marx theorised that technological unemployment and huge abundance of resources would eventually cause society to transition to a moneyless, stateless, classless society. I think bitcoin, or a similar tech, could be a possible route into this society because it desrupts those three institutions/constructs - money, the state, and class.

It also could be a practical way this society would function. Andreas Antonopoulos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KW99t-fgeE) talks about micro- and nano-payments, and 'streaming money', for example a driver being insured by each mile they drive a car. Coupled with advances in A.I., whole industries could run themselves, and trade with other industries using bitcoin. [Tokyo's subway](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329764-000-the-ai-boss-that-deploys-hong-kongs-subway-engineers/) has its maintenance run by an A.I. In a few decades, it's entirely feasible that all essential industries (food, water, shelter, energy etc.), could be almost entirely run by an A.I. Bitcoin and/or other cryptos could be the medium of exchange that the A.I. uses.

The A.I. would be aiming to provide the best service to its human customers, sometimes even competing with other A.I.s. Every A.I. would be hard coded with their aim - maximising the quality of life for all humans. The A.I. code becomes the only thing which resembles a state - a democratically decided common set of rules. The entire A.I. economy would be based on such rules, and bitcoin is the way the A.I.s trade and incentivise each other to fulfill this task.

The humans wouldn't be using bitcoin, or any other form of money. Everything would be provided for them. Their lives would be concerned with indulging their passions, hobbies, romances, social life, health etc.

You would go to a party and the bar would make a cocktail from a new recipe it's trying out. You order a few more and get drunk. The bar notices the new recipe is going down well, and the bar chain's A.I. orders more of the ingredients from a supplier A.I. It pays in bitcoin. Meanwhile, you're passed out in a driverless taxi which your city's transport A.I. just paid bitcoin to make sure you get home safely. You wouldn't have used any money all night.",1539040447,08/10/2018 23:14:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mjw4g/bitcoin_and_the_postscarcity_society/,1

It says an anti-rival good, when used by more people, becomes more valuable to each of the individuals.

They list languages as an example, as the more people learn or adopt a certain language, the more valuable it becomes for those who currently speak it.

Do you guys think that Bitcoin would also qualify, then, as the more mainstream it becomes, the more people participate of it, and the more transactions are carried out by it, the more valuable it becomes to everybody?

Additionally, do you think this extra ""value"" can be equated to sale price of a unit of currency? As in, a more ubiquitous Bitcoin would trade for more $$$ per BTC?",1539080706,09/10/2018 10:25:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mnz5h/would_bitcoin_be_an_antirival_good_per_this/,1

Early functions of a full node,"In the 'Network' section of the Bitcoin Whitepaper, the 'steps to run the network' are described as follows:

1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.

2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.

3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.

4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.

5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.

6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the
chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.


To me, this reads like the full nodes are responsible for the mining of new blocks. 

I understand that mining has developed significantly since the early days, but my question is, was there a point in time when the function of mining was separated from the early full node implementation? 
Do the modern full node implementations (e.g. Bitcoin Core) have any mining capabilities, or are they strictly concerned with storing, validating &amp; propagating the blockchain ?",1539083872,09/10/2018 11:17:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mo9iv/early_functions_of_a_full_node/,1

"Bitcoin Volumes Surge Nearly 30% as it Price Breaks Out of $6,550","Throughout the past seven days, CCN consistently reported that the low volume of Bitcoin had posed a serious issue for the rest of the market. Although tokens started to initiate some big gains on October 8, the lack of momentum on BTC has prevented the market from initiating large gains to the upside.

For most of October, Bitcoin was bear biased, with weakening $6,500 support level and continuous demonstration of low market activity.

Decentralized global content ecosystem [Contentos](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contentos.io%2F&amp;esheet=51875593&amp;newsitemid=20181001005633&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Contentos&amp;index=1&amp;md5=3d46d9ba1915e1cf09e01b557c0e8efa)¬†had announced a multi-million dollar investment from Binance Labs.

Launched by Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance Labs is an incubator and social impact fund that invests in top¬†projects that are using blockchain technology to transform diverse industries.

‚ÄúThe idea for Contentos began when I noticed a serious need for a decentralized content ecosystem offering transparent and fair monetization of creators‚Äô content, and no third-party censorship or removal of content,‚Äù said Mick Tsai, CEO and co-founder of Contentos. ‚ÄúThe Contentos team is thrilled to have the support of Binance Labs in pursuing our goal to revolutionize the preservation and monetization of digital content, while working towards creating a more positive ecosystem for all content creators, influencers, and content consumers.‚Äù

As of now, Contentos is one of the first open-source-code blockchains that includes content distribution amongst its capabilities. Contentos aims to provide a decentralized ecosystem for content creators to have creative freedom and to leave their digital footprint without the risk of third-party interference. Unlike similar projects building new products and features to adapt to blockchain technology, the Contentos team has already integrated with three successful products, LiveMe, PhotoGrid, and Cheez, and is currently available to users around the world.

Recently, Contentos also announced partnerships with Ontology and NEO Foundation. Contentos‚Äôs partnership with Ontology acts as a collaborative effort to use both companies‚Äô expertise to expand upon existing blockchain research, application development, and community-building. With the NEO Global Capital partnership ‚Äì a subsidiary of the NEO Foundation ‚Äì there will be more opportunities for Contentos to explore technology-based solutions for developing capabilities. The Contentos team is excited to see that their strategic efforts, thus far, have been positively received by a number of leading investors and prominent figures from the blockchain community. With their new partnerships and investments, Contentos is confident in the direction they are headed as they continue to develop their comprehensive protocol to promote the integration of blockchain and social media

(SEC) in the United States called for comments regarding nine previously rejected Bitcoin ETFs,"In a series of rulings on October 4, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States called for comments regarding nine previously rejected Bitcoin ETFs. The ETFs include two ProShares BTC ETFs, five submitted by Direxion, and two proposed by GraniteShares. If the ETFs were to be accepted, the first seven would be listed on NYSE Arca, and the GraniteShares ETFs would be listed on CBOE.

Statements in support or rejection of any of the proposed ETFs can be submitted until November 5. The SEC‚Äôs call for comments is part of a review announced by the SEC in August after the ETF proposals were rejected.

Make XRP the official cryptocurrency of the Tokyo Olympics 2020!,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/305fhgqkj6r11.jpg

 

The countdown to the Tokyo Olympics 2020 has begun!

While this global¬†event presents great cultural and economic opportunities, hosting countries also face many challenges¬†concerning infrastructure, transportation and payment systems.

As tourists stream into the country, demand for the local currency skyrockets, causing long lines at currency exchanges, as seen at past events like Beijing 2008 and Rio de Janeiro 2016. Confusing exchange rates and language barriers further¬†complicate the problem.

We believe that¬†the fast transaction times and security of Ripple Lab's XRP cryptocurrency¬†would be a great contribution towards solving this problem.

We thank you for your support!

"Got hacked last night, need some insight...","So last night, apparently someone transferred $40 worth of bitcoin out of my account to an address who has not yet spent the funds or sent them to a main wallet.

What I don't understand is

1. My email that I use has not been logged into for 4 days, I checked the activity and only shows my IP address too.
2. I have not installed any rats and I definitely do not have a bitcoin clipboard changer on my PC either.
3. I am extremely savvy about my online security and always know what is a scam and what isn't so there's no way I could have possibly been hacked because I do not visit insecure websites.
4. This happened last night when I was laying down to sleep, literally watching my screen the entire time, impossible for it to be a rat.

No I don't use 2FA but that doesn't explain how someone from another location could possibly have logged in without verification from the blockchain authorization email especially when they can't steal the cookies of my browser without some sort of program I download, which I haven't at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Lightning Network API method ConnectPeer,"I was perusing then LN gRPC API docs when I happened upon the 'ConnectPeer' method. 

ConnectPeer is defined as:

&gt; ConnectPeer attempts to establish a connection to a remote peer. This is at the networking level, and is used for communication between nodes. This is distinct from establishing a channel with a peer.


This suggests that LN nodes may connect to one another without having an active channel open. Assuming that funds are routed across the network via open channels, what is the purpose of these network level connections ?",1539103127,09/10/2018 16:38:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mqqvy/lightning_network_api_method_connectpeer/,1

Curious bitcoin tax scenario question about which coins to FIFO...,"I am discussing a situation with my CPA. Say one started investing in Bitcoin in 2013 and bought coins at /around $100. sold, traded, used many since then, however, 2017 will be the first year reporting it on tax returns. 

The CPA wants to FIFO and uses the first coins bought in 2013 against the sales of 2017, this seems not FIFO to me, and creates a massive gain (All be it long term rate not short) I argued he should use the first sold since 2013 all the way up to 2017 so the gains are less, and FIFO is more accurate. However the rebuttal is that we should then go back and refile 2014 on up every year to show those gains.. this would be the best next option as you are paying on all gains. While this makes some sense, I see that this giant gain situation could go on indefinitely if we do not catch up on transactions that have a smaller gain loss by matching coins closer in time at some point? Any thoughts on this?",1539103878,09/10/2018 16:51:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mquxq/curious_bitcoin_tax_scenario_question_about_which/,1
"What‚Äôs to stop Bitcoin from becoming a centralized, banked fiat?","I‚Äôm newish to Crypto and have a question:

Bitcoin is decentralized because of the block chain.  We all love it for that reason.

Bitcoin needs world wide adoption. 

However, the real problem for the average user, to me (as average and new to crypto myself), is storage. 

Hear me out.

When gold and coins were the currency of old times , people were worried about losing them or being robbed (sound familiar?) 

So the idea of a bank as business was created to store the gold under armed guards and lock/key. 

The banks would issue notes that the depositor could carry and redeem anytime for their gold.

Well, instead of redeeming the notes for gold, then trading the gold for goods, people would trade the notes simply because they were lighter and easier to manage/store.

If you lost your note, you could just prove your identity and you‚Äôd still have access.

Aaand that‚Äôs where paper currency came from. The real damage came later when we stopped allowing them to be redeemed. 

We seem to have a similar problem. Sure, early adopters and purists will use hardware wallets and protect it themselves but when/if this thing hits mass adoption, what‚Äôs to stop the whole bank / fiat currency thing from happening again on top of bitcoin?

Grandma doesn‚Äôt care about decentralization. She cares about being protected against theft and buying oatmeal. 

Not trolling. Genuinely curious. Do you think history will repeat itself here? Why or why not?",1539104205,09/10/2018 16:56:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mqwk7/whats_to_stop_bitcoin_from_becoming_a_centralized/,1

Idea: Tipping bot. A bot that gives you free coins.,"So I have an idea. What would happend if we created a bot that just only gives. 

So the idea goes like this:
We create a cryptocurrency. We create an adress that will hold 21000 billion coins (That's how much money there is in the world). Then we integreate a bot with an algoritm. We do it like this: We have 21000 billion coins in one adress. If we all could somehow start with 1 coin that would be great. Then we do it like this: We send 1 coin to the adress/bot and immidiately get 3 coins back. We then send 2 coins to the adress/bot and get 5 coins back. We then send 3 coins to the bot and get 10 coins back. Send 4 get 20. Send 5 get back 50. Send 6 get back 100. Send 7 coins get 225 coins back. Send 8 coins and get 500 coins back. Send 9 coins and get 1000 coins back.

Easy algoritm isnt? hehe.

The idea is to ""ping"" against the adress/bot to recieve coins. Does anyone get it?

Contact me if you have more questions.

I would be very glad if someone wants to try this thing out. Feel free to try creating a bot who does this.
What if then everyone wanted to play this game?

Questions about Bakkt,"1. Due to the limited supply of BTC. How will these services be able to offer physical led backed BTC funds without skyrocketing the price? This temporary moment of stability doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to last.

2. Will Bakkt have their own inventory? Or will they buy when orders are placed?

3. How would they acquire inventory? Large orders from exchanges?

4. When would they accumulate inventory? They have to be testing this for the masses already?

5. How will the market be able to track the current supply and how will that impact the price?

6. I know this is a phase from becoming new technology but how will the market shake off the whales from natural growth so we can just let them cash out and move forward from here?

What would you do if you would have great idea for the world?,"Hey guys.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have great idea for improving social life with crypto/tokens -  which is useful for goverment and people, I am sure the society will have great impact with that. 

but I dont know yet what would be the right way to start organizing and moving this thing forward.

1. Are there any legit specialized organizations that help to find people and funds for such things?
2. How I can be sure that my idea will be not created behind me?
3. Where I can find the right places to present my document or idea?
4. Where or how I can find the right people who can help me build and create that project?

I would be thankful if you could help me and others out with such question!",1539119596,09/10/2018 21:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mt4s5/what_would_you_do_if_you_would_have_great_idea/,1

Why aren't we more afraid of a 51% attack on BTC? Is there some countermeasure I'm unaware of?,"Look at the amount of hash power in the major pools, say the top 7 pools. We're talking about basically 80%+ of all hashpower is in these pools.

Assuming these pools (on the low end) are enjoying 1% of mining rewards (most goes to hardware holders contributing to the pool) we're talking roughly a million dollars per day spread among these 7 pools. That is not very much money in the grand scheme of things.

A state actor would probably be able to monetarily convince or by force coerce cooperation.

State actor says:

""Alright, look, mining pools 1 through 7, 

* Make announcements to all of your miners that you're STILL going to pay to their mining addresses BTC
* but as a pool you're going to tripling their payouts and tell your miner contributors that you're going to front the money as a pool
* You tell your pool members that you're going to be testing some alternative chains / etc and doing some proof of concept work and you're tripling their rewards in BTC to keep contributing their hashpower
* Now, move all your hash power to BCH chain (this causes a tizzy, people notice, but the damage is being done and a lot of hardware owners are ok with it anyway because they're being paid out 3x)
* At some point in this process, maybe as difficulty is rapidly falling, get on exchanges and add buy pressure, I'm talking 10s of millions of dollars worth of buy pressure daily to drive up the price
* Wait for difficulty to adjust downward as many times as necessary on BTC chain
* Once difficulty is sufficiently low, 51% attack the chain for a sustained period, a day or a week all the while maintaining the 3x payouts to pool contributors to keep the hash power, but also begin scamming the exchanges
* If exchanges catch on, or hash power starts falling because people wise-up and stop contributing to your 7 cheat pools, then start mining empty blocks as long as possible

""

Of course there are some logistical holes in this (I've thought it through all of a half hour with a budget of $0), but we're talking a state actor here. 1% of GDP for one year \~$100 BILLION, and honestly, this would probably be the sort of thing that superpower states might team up to do. The funding is there to actually carry this out. Right now, states don't fear BTC yet. It's an ultra-volatile science project that only the fringe are interested in. But if BTC ever becomes a real player in the international economy, this could be worth it to a state, or states.

&amp;#x200B;

Are countermeasures or plans in place to prevent / avoid / damage control / recover from an attack like this?

An attack like this would prove to the masses that BTC is not viable as a trustworthy currency. It would take decades to get people back to **today's** level of skepticism, let alone reaching adoption or mainstream.",1539124052,09/10/2018 22:27:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mtr29/why_arent_we_more_afraid_of_a_51_attack_on_btc_is/,1

How do you go about finding the hash rate of a computer?,"Hi, I'm a college student who is trying to find ways to earn money to help pay the bloodsucking leech that is tuition. I recently came into the opportunity to buy 10 tower computers - with Intel Core 2 Duo Chips. I was trying to find what the hash rate was - and then work out the math to see if buying them and mining with them would be decently profitable.


Since I currently live in dorms, I don't need to pay for electricity, so I think this is the optimal time for me to start mining.

So how do I find the hash rate of the Core 2 Duo? Will it be worth it in your analysis? I'm greener that grass here and could use any help I could get.",1539126081,09/10/2018 23:01:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mu0ia/how_do_you_go_about_finding_the_hash_rate_of_a/,1

"PayPal for Crypto: Up to 25,000 Online Stores in Germany May Accept Digital Money in 2019"," 

A Swiss startup company is attempting to make using cryptocurrencies for online transactions as simple and safe as using PayPal.

The main accusation of the mainstream media against crypto is that it is ‚Äúa currency that is hard to spend.‚Äù Even though, according to CNBC, the total worth of Bitcoin spent on merchant services has increased to $190.2 million in 2017, from $9.8 million in 2013, however the market is still in its infancy. According to a [s](https://www.dnb.nl/binaries/Working%20Paper%20No.%20585_tcm46-373269.pdf)tudy published by the Bank of Netherlands in February 2018, only two percent of online retailers accepted crypto, in spite of ""substantial"" interest.

The UTRUST API is aimed at online and point-of-sale crypto acceptance worldwide. This set of tools will also include a conflict mitigation system, chargeback protection, and a proprietary cryptocurrency which increases purchasing power within the platform. While UTRUST has their sights set on assisting global retailers in the use of crypto it has decided to launch its business in Europe.

 The company has signed strategic partnerships in Europe to establish a ""beachhead"" for further expansion. One such partnership is Gambio.de, a German e-commerce solution provider with more than 25,000 online stores. According to UTRUST¬¥s estimates, Gambio-powered stores generate about 30 percent of e-commerce revenue in Germany and therefore are in a powerful starting position for UTRUST to expand across the continent.

UTRUST says these partnerships mean that from the first day of operation, thousands of merchants will be able to accept cryptocurrencies in a simplified way, while receiving fiat currencies in their bank accounts. Furthermore, UTRUST customers will have access to a proprietary digital wallet which allows zero fee transactions. The company believes, the large amount of merchants will offset the lower figures of cryptocurrency use, gaining UTRUST a substantial foot-hold in the on coming crypto economy. The company intends to help all businesses it interacts with, and rise with the tide of cryptocurrencies.",1539158069,10/10/2018 07:54:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mxhds/paypal_for_crypto_up_to_25000_online_stores_in/,1

\- come up with a proposal to improve &lt;insert feature&gt;

\- create a software wallet that does &lt;X&gt; but not &lt;Y&gt;

\- come up with a solution to problem &lt;X&gt;

A quick survey about taxes and cryptocurrencies for my bachelor thesis,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm currently working on my bachelor thesis in digital product design at a German university. The idea is to create product-based tax reporting solutions for private investors. I created this survey to get relevant data streams about the pain-points in the process of taxing cryptocurrencies. The survey only takes about 2 minutes and is anonymous. It would help a lot if some of you would submit answers.

Here is the survey:

Messed up and send funds before receiving confirmations,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

about 30 minutes ago I sent someone some money in exchange for bitcoin but didn't check that it had at least 1 confirmation. I just saw that the balance of my account had gone up, but didn't check if I had received any confirmations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to get it confirmed? I remember hearing that there is an option to ask a miner to include the tx in the block, but I'm not quite that technically savvy.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks in advance if anyone can help, It's not a lot of cash but still annoying.

Where are transaction validation checks implemented in the source code?,"Hi all, I'm trying to study blockchains (mostly Bitcoin) starting from the fundamental principles, and looking at where exactly those principles are implemented in the source code.

I understand that consensus (mining) and transaction validation are different concepts. AFAIK, each full node validates transactions and puts the valid ones into its own memory pool. Miners select transactions from the mempool and carry out the mining process to create a block.

Are there additional checks carried out by miners? If so, where are they in the Bitcoin source code? So far, I've found that transaction validation is carried out by some functions in main.cpp like AccepttoMemoryPool, while mining is implemented (not surprisingly) in miner.cpp

 Am I missing something?",1539174664,10/10/2018 12:31:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mz0xb/where_are_transaction_validation_checks/,1

Why October Could Be The Month for A Bitcoin Rally?," The International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded the world economic growth outlook, by spurring risk-off trading across the globe. This pushed Bitcoin to a high of $6,656, but the price retraced fast as the move wasn‚Äôt supported by volume. What this means is that any breakout, upwards or downwards, should have healthy volume behind it. Only this can assure that the price continues its move further. If the volume isn‚Äôt there, it is more than likely that the breakout is short-lived.   


And how do you think, will October be the month for a Bitcoin Rally?

"When discussing Crypto, know how to counter these strategies: Gish gallop, Sealioning, Chewbacca defense [sic!]","It is no secret, that certain well known members of the crypto community are really good of seemingly winning a discussion without really having the majority of facts or even the truth on their side. 

These types of speakers are often characterised as 'passionate', but in reality they are aggressive or even hostile against their opponent. They bring forth a few facts to underline their point and spend a tremendous amount of energy to prevent the other party of formulating or speaking out a laid out chain of thought.

These are the most common strategies used in these types of discussions. Try to spot them and learn how to counter them. 

1) The Gish Gallop
Basically just a Trojan Horse with arguments. The speaker presents a huge amount of arguments, some of them really good, but a lot of them just trash. They validate their trash with the good and make it impossible to refute the arguments by hiding them in the sheer mass of points made. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop

2) Sealioning
The strategy here is to hinder the speaking party to make their point by constantly asking for evidence or constantly repeating questions. It is basically a DDOS on the speaker. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning

3) Chewbacca defense [sic!]
Yes, it is really called that. It wasn't invented by South Park, but they coined the term. It is basically the strategy of confusing the listening party to lead them away from the real facts or arguments. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca_defense

======= 

Go watch some videos from the Crypto Cruise with these strategy in mind. You will immediately spot some people using some or all of these techniques, intentionally or not.

I think it is no surprise that you can spot Rodger doing these all the time. Think about him what you want, but he IS a really hard person to discuss with. If you ever find yourself in such a discussion and you feel under pressure from the counter party, there are a few rules to force a discussion into a more civilised way. 

1) Silence hurts but is good
If you need time to think, take time to think. Speaking fast makes it hard to follow you as a listener and even harder to think about your arguments. Silence hurts you the most. But the time you are not speaking and thinking seems longer in your head than it really is. So just take the time to think about what you want to say, it's worth it.

2) Stand your ground
As a general rule: NEVER answer binary questions with a binary answer. Questions like ""Would you agree that..."" are primed to force you into a position. Never agree or disagree. Always begin your answer with a statement about your position, something like ""I think that..."". That makes it hard to put words in your mouth.

3) Walk away when necessary
When you feel yourself under pressure voice your concern and walk away when necessary. It is perfectly fine to take the high ground and claim your need to take time to formulate your thoughts and your desire not to be interrupted. And if the counter party keeps doing that, walk a way with the argument that you had hoped for a more civilised, formal discussion. No shame in that. 

What are your tips for a good discussion? ",1539181321,10/10/2018 14:22:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9mzw4e/when_discussing_crypto_know_how_to_counter_these/,1

Why Should You Get a Loan secured by crypto?,"**Why Should You Get a Loan secured by crypto?**

*Lending is traditionally considered a banking domain. However, since the advent of cryptocurrency and blockchain, many more lending options have come to the fore. Now you can get a fiat or USD/USDT loan using your cryptocurrency as a collateral.* 

So why should you discard the old ways in favor of a new alternative? Why should you choose a cryptoloan over a traditional bank loan? 

**Avoid Selling Crypto to Get Fiat** 

Sometimes you need fiat, and you need it fast. You might want to buy real estate, cars or simply have some pocket cash. Although selling crypto may be your first thought, it may not be far-sighted, especially if the current price is not in your favor. It would be way more beneficial to take a USD/USDT loan secured by your crypto and pay little interest on top than to risk losing the value of your digital currency.

**Benefit from the Cryptomarket Volatility**

Apart from buying stuff, you may want to use fiat to buy more crypto. It is especially relevant for those involved in exchange and trading. When the price of your favorite cryptocurrency slumps, you may need fiat fast to buy it before the market takes yet another abrupt turn. This is where P2P lending is quite handy, as it is much more expedient than getting a traditional bank loan. 

**Act Fast in Case of Emergency** 

When tragedy strikes, there is no time for the bank‚Äôs red tape. Getting a cryptoloan will protect you from numerous clerks, papers and meaningless procedures. Because blockchain technology that supports cryptocurrency lending is inherently secure, you do not have to deal with intermediaries to prove your identity and reliability. 

**Keep Your Credit Scoring Intact**

Getting a loan from the bank may negatively impact your credit standing. This does not apply to the P2P lending platforms. When you get a cryptoloan, your credit scoring remains intact, even if you fail to pay it off. What is more, even individuals with no credit history can get a cryptoloan, which opens up numerous investments opportunities. 

**Do Not Pay More Tax** 

When you sell cryptocurrency, you have to pay tax. When you borrow USD/USDT, you do not have to pay tax. Which option do you like more? Even if you say that taxes will be lower than interest and transaction fees, you should not forget about cryptocurrency volatility. It would be a shame to sell your coins right before their price starts growing exponentially. 

**Diversity Your Investments Portfolio**

For effective crypto asset management and risk mitigation, it is important to have a diverse investments portfolio. Getting a cryptoloan will allow you to do just that. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Get USD/USDT loans and use them to buy multiple cryptocurrencies while the prices are low. By having different coins, you safeguard yourself from market volatility. 

**Forget About Never-Ending Bureaucracy**

The absence of bureaucracy is the most obvious benefit for people choosing a cryptoloan. Unlike traditional banks, P2P lending platforms do not require its users to jump through a thousand flaming hoops for their loan to be approved. Cryptoloans are powered by blockchain, which provides for almost immediate authentication and lending. 

**Enjoy Increased Safety with a Flexible Loan** 

Cryptoloans are flexible, which ensures a better safety for both investors and borrowers. Let‚Äôs say you used 1 BTC to collateralize a loan of 3,500 USD. If the BTC price goes up, a borrower may get some of their crypto back on their wallet. If the BTC price goes down, a borrower will need to send more crypto as collateral. It is a fair system for both parties. 

**Get a Loan on Your Own Terms**

Many P2P platforms allow its investors and borrowers to form agreements on their own. Parties submit their unique loan requests/offers and wait for the right person or business to come along. This way neither lenders nor borrowers have to follow the arbitrary rules imposed by an intermediary. They can strike truly unique agreements that satisfy both sides. 

**Take Advantage of P2P Lending Liquidity** 

Because P2P lending is not limited by geographical borders, it involves more participates which in turn guarantees a higher liquidity. You are more likely to find the right investor or borrower than in a pool curtailed by bank policies and regulations. What is more, you can check their transaction history and feel assured of their financial integrity. 

P2P lending is still a new phenomenon in the world of finance. However, when you consider all the benefits, it is easy to see how one day getting a cryptoloan would become mainstream.

Banks will always be against cryptocurrencies?," No, I do not believe that. We must admit that what has allowed banks to acquire so much economic power is their ability to understand where capital is, and make the necessary efforts to keep it.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing that banks will never fight against capital, what I see today is a growing interest of banks to incorporate blockchain technologies into their processes, and because of their marked interest in taking over everyone's money, it would not be strange that in the near future we will see banks willing to accept cryptocurrencies to carry out financial transactions.

The platform connects cryptocurrency exchanges, brokers and financial institutions around the world. So far, more than 20 companies have signed up, including Bitfinex, Bitmex and OKCoin.

The goal is to improve liquidity, which has been an issue in the market, said Samson Mow, Blockstream‚Äôs chief strategy officer. ""Liquidity across exchanges is definitively not there yet,"" he said in an interview. ""With the advent of Liquid -- with faster settlement times -- we should be able to improve it by making it faster and easier to transfer.

Singapore Will Help Crypto Firms Set Up Local Bank Accounts,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img au8a0rnvxer11...*

Singapore‚Äôs financial regulator is willing to lend a hand to cryptocurrency firms having problems setting up local bank accounts, but doesn‚Äôt plan to loosen its rules to lure more crypto startups to the country.

&gt;‚ÄúWe should not be trying to create an extremely lax regulatory environment in order to attract that kind of business,"" Monetary Authority of Singapore Managing Director Ravi Menon said Tuesday when discussing the crypto industry in an interview with Bloomberg News. ‚ÄúWhat we are trying to do is to bring the banks and cryptocurrency fintech startups together to see if there is some understanding they can reach.‚Äù

Singapore has been pushing to develop its financial technology sector as a way of creating...

How dangerous is reusing a paper wallet?,"Let's say I have a paper wallet with a public-private keypair that I use for small amounts of pocket money. A phone wallet that allows cold storage sending would let me scan the private key when I want to send a payment without ever storing the private key on the phone (where it could be stolen by a hacker). These are small amounts of money and privacy is not an issue. Is there any know way to steal funds from an address that has been reused multiple times?

It seems to me that a laminated paper wallet w/ BIP38 password plus a cold-spend mobile wallet would be both hack-proof and convenient to use. Am I missing something?",1539201838,10/10/2018 20:03:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9n2yyz/how_dangerous_is_reusing_a_paper_wallet/,1

My idea on how the get popular.,"So I just came up with an algoritm I would want to try out but I'm broke as hell so I'm just giving the idea for free. I need input.

You do this:
1. You buy 1500 dogecoin for 10 dollars. 
2. You find one person and does this: You give him 10 dogecoins and go: I will give you 20 coins if you can get 1 person to send back 1 coin to me, you will get 1 coin extra for every person who that sends a coin back. 
You have 10 coins so you can give coins for up to 10 people WHILE they also can earn another 2 coins if they just send the coin back to me.
 
You tell the first person that the people who wants another free coin has to send their dogecoin adresses to me on twitter so I can transfer the coins to them.

What do guys think about the idea, the algoritm?",1539204088,10/10/2018 20:41:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9n3b81/my_idea_on_how_the_get_popular/,1

The hairy crabs are traced back to the source. Is LEOOY still able to achieve blockchain tourism?,"In the case of blockchain technology and the rising heat, blockchain tourism has also seen the huge potential of blockchains in streamlining business processes, removing middlemen and tracking cargo information. LEOOY took the lead in the tourism industry to reshape consumers' perceptions of tourism. However, in the face of the booming tourism industry, can LEOOY change the current status of the OTA control market with a small force?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/071464wasir11.png

The importance of tourism in the national economy has gradually increased, but the development of the tourism industry has always faced some problems. Nowadays, there are four obvious pain points in the tourism industry.

First, the lack of trust systems, such as the temporary price hikes of businesses, the scams and other issues are endless;

Second, false evaluation. The travel agency and the online travel platform hired the water army to issue false evaluations;

Third, lack of supporting services, such as lack of tourism-related services, such as surrounding traffic congestion, tourism safety and other issues are difficult to resolve;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zzs9vr0xuir11.png

Fourth, the lack of sustainable development, such as the consumption of a single tourist attraction is mostly one-time consumption, tourists lack of follow-up consumption power, consumption is weak.

And LEOOY can solve these four pain points by using blockchain technology. First of all, in response to the lack of trust system and false evaluation, LEOOY uses blockchain technology to package all information (transaction information, service information, user business behavior) of the platform permanently on the blockchain to ensure that the information cannot be modified; In addition to information, all information is open to all, ensuring that all participation and speech can be traced back; ensuring that the platform data is transparent.

Secondly, in the face of the lack of support services for traditional tourism, LEOOY provides each user with an independent digital identity - LEOOY Pass, which enables users to trace the source and ensure user security issues during the journey. LEOOY enhances customer consumption by professional travel services, adopts a community autonomy system, and the platform is only responsible for maintaining the normal operation of the platform. All participants participate in community building. Blockchain intelligent contract rules and incentives automatically contribute to the community. Participants will earn points and credit rewards. The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the user has been mobilized.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hzei6c3zuir11.png

Today, tourism is increasingly defined by stratification. The number of steps required to plan a trip (involving airlines, booking a hotel, finding an event, airport navigation) is inconvenient. However, by implementing a blockchain, the industry can begin to eliminate unnecessary barriers and bottlenecks, streamline the travel process, and provide greater value to everyone involved, from the consumer to the company itself.

Although the blockchain tourism is not mature at this stage, LEOOY provides standardized, intelligent and big data by giving full play to the advantages of blockchain technology, such as multi-party participation, openness and transparency, consensus trust, traceability, tampering, and privacy protection. At the same time, the tourism support service provider realizes efficient management, intelligent service, precision marketing and other business enhancements. LEOOY also brings convenient, efficient, credible and preferential travel experience to tourism consumers.",1539249360,11/10/2018 09:16:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9n8bal/the_hairy_crabs_are_traced_back_to_the_source_is/,1

Find 310 BTC in this picture!,"Recently an anonymous user released a picture online. This picture contains four clues, each clue represents a private key of Bitcoin wallet. These wallets contain 0.1 BTC, 0.2 BTC, 0.31BTC and 310 BTC.

Need advice on choosing a trading platform,"Hi friends. I want to start trading but don't know what to begin with. Stories about exchanges like Bithumb, Bitfinex, or Poloniex freak me out, and I don't want to repeat the mistakes of people who traded there. 

I want to be sure that my money, once invested, will be kept safe &amp; secure, and no one would have access to it. 

I believe cyber security is one of the most important features of a good trading platform. Even though I know what makes a platform secure, I cannot find the one that would be reliable enough. All websites with crypto exchange reviews seem to be pay-to-pay ones - they don't give objective information on the quality&amp;security of those platforms. Given that, I have a few questions:

1. Which platforms would you recommend - centralized or decentralized ones - and why?
2. Are there any trusted websites with real-life info &amp; feedback about different exchange platforms? (I'm not talking about ICO listings here, but about reviews from experienced traders or crypto professionals)
3. Do you know any crypto bloggers who can share their trading skills/knowledge with newbies like me?

Any assistance/advice will be highly appreciated. ",1539253341,11/10/2018 10:22:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9n8owq/need_advice_on_choosing_a_trading_platform/,1

VirWox banned my account after sending in a support ticket about me being hacked,"Im keeping this short, i used VirWox a couple of times to buy BTC via paypal. Around 100 swissfrancs per transaction and had no problems at all to cashout. I then stopped to buy for around 1 or 2 months, yesterday i got an email that my paypal account got charged with 180 Euros and well that was certainly not me. First thing i did was to log into VirWox and it gave me a notification that my last login was a couple minutes before i got the email from paypal and it was from an Amazon Cloud Server.


Well, i then thought im going to contact their support about it.. guess what? They banned my whole account 5-10 minutes later without any reply back.
I know it has to be somehow my fault but i really can't wrap my head around how they got apperantly acces to my paypal account aswell but left money on there? I made serveral virus scanns and all that but found nothing, i never download any shady stuff or click on weird links. I also called paypal yesterday and they said they will look into it and can cleary see that the IP that got into my paypal account was never used before in my history so they will probably decide in my favor.. they did not. Everything seems like a normal transaction to them but i will call them again after writing this post.


TL;DR - Fuck VirWox for banning accounts outright after sending in a support ticket.

An algoritm to understand Bitcoin volatility,"So I'm trying to figure out how the bitcoin volatility and price works. I've come up with an algoritm I want to try out but I have no money so I just gonna write the algoritm here. I would like input.

The algoritm goes like this:
1. You post your bitcoin adress and I send you 0.00000010 BTC (0,00062 dollars)
2.  You then send me back the smallest amount possible of the bitcoin I just gave you and I will send you 0,0000016 BTC (0.01 dollars)

3. To get even more bitcoin do this:
Find someone who wants free bitcoin. Tell him he can get 0.00000010 BTC (0,00062 dollars)
worth of Bitcoin for free if he accepts to recieve and send the smallest amount of bitcoin possible to me.
If he accepts you send him 00000002 BTC (0,00012 dollars) and tell him to send those bitcoins to me. When he has send me the 0.00000002 BTC (0,00012 dollars ) I will personally myself send him 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent) and then send you 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent).

For more and more people you do this to I will reward you with more and more bitcoin. 

3. If you want more bitcoin - find a second person and do the same thing as before. Tell him he can get free bitcoin by recieving and sending bitcoin. If he accepts you send him 0.00000002 BTC (0,00012 dollars). He then sends the bitcoins to me. When I get the bitcoins I will personally reward  both you and him with Bitcoin. I will give you 0,0000048 BTC (3 cents) and him 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent). 

4. You can then do this to a third person. If the third person recieves and sends bitcoin back to me (0.00000002 BTC (0,00012 dollars)) I will give you 0,0000064 BTC (4 cents) and that person 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent).

5. If you do this to a fourth person I will give you 0,0000081 BTC (5 cents) and him 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent).

6. To the persons who got 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent) from me for recieving and sending bitcoins - you can get more bitcoin by doing the same thing as the person did before. Do the same thing and find someone who wants free bitcoin. Tell the person he can get 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent) if he recieves 0.00000002 BTC (0,00012 dollars) from you and then send the smallest amount possible to me. I will then send 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent) worth of  bitcoin to him and 0,0000032 BTC (2 cents) worth of bitcoin to you. 

7. Do this to a second person and I will give you 0,0000048 (3 cents) and that person 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent).

8. Do it to a fourth person and I will give you 0,0000064 (4 cents) and that person 0,0000016 (1 cent).

9. To the people who just got 0,0000016 (1 cent) from me (step 6-8) - you can also get more bitcoins by also finding someone who wants free bitcoin. If they accept to recieve and send bitcoin to get more bitcoin you send them 0.00000002 BTC (0,00012 dollars) and tell them to send the smallest amount possible to me. I will personally send these persons 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent) and then send you 0,0000032 BTC (2 cents).

10. Do this to a second person and I will give you 0,0000048 (3 cents) and him 0,0000016 BTC (1 cent).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that's how the algoritm works to recieve and send free Bitcoin.

Reverse Bitcoin Challenge,"Hello all friends 

The usual challenge is to provide a bitcoin address, in a wallet with a bitcoin equivalent to the one you will receive when decrypting the password.

This time I want to challenge the opposite: I give you address bitcoin wallet, then each person transfers a bitcoin amount into the wallet. Every day, the number of bitcoins in the wallet will be more and more. I will inform you each transaction. One of the earliest finders is the person who gets the full amount of the bitcoin. If after October 27, no one can find the password. The bitcoin will belong to me. I'm not a programmer, just a normal person. I guarantee the game is fair.

Bitcoin is all grown up!,"So a bunch of physicist set out to analyse Bitcoin using the same methods that were used to evaluate if the new EU emerging markets in the post socialist era were stable and mature or likely to collapse. Some highlights from the article:


* An analysis was carried out for changes of the Bitcoin price in the period from 2012 to April 2018, posted in one-minute sequences. Rates of return were first in line. There is good quantitative evidence that in a mature market and in sufficiently short time scales their probability distributions are subject to inverse cubic law. [...] ""Later on, the rates of return fluctuated according to the inverse cubic law"".

* ""In the case of Bitcoin, we detected multifractality in the functions of fluctuations in rates of return, particularly evident in the last six months of the examined period. This was of the same type as for regular, mature markets, such as the stock, dollar, oil or bond markets.""

* It turns out that for the Bitcoin market, the Hurst exponent approaches 0.5, which is characteristic of markets with a high reputation.

* The most important statistical parameters of the Bitcoin market indicate very clearly that for many months now it has met all the important criteria of financial maturity.


Wonder what Roubini, Schiller, Krugman and the other veryverysalty^(TM) bunch of nocoiners will say about this.

Another idea why the stock market dumped in relation to bitcoin,"When you look at the bitcoin (and in general crypto market cap) you see the big support at about 6000 since months now. The ups are getting lower and lower. Its a clear descending triangle. The drop today of bitcoin was just a logical step followed by this triangle. You can do some simple TA on it or have a look at all the analysis [https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/descendingtriangle/](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/descendingtriangle/)

So but why did then the stock market have this big dump? Lets first look again at bitcoin. The triangle is coming to an end within the next days, maybe 2 weeks or less. So there are of course 3 possibilities: Bear market, Pull market or even more sideways. But after this kind of triangle and based on the bitcoin long holders and history, most people except a pull market.

Also the volume is decreasing the last weeks and days, which is a big signal for a bear trap, before we see a big pull market again.

To finally get back to the stock market. There might be a chance, big investors took out some percent of their wealth of the stock market, and will invest it in bitcoin, as they see the charts, the analyses and the next logical step of bitcoin.

The stock market drop was not very big, but the timing of both is just so perfect. And bitcoin did for sure not follow stock market, as bitcoin is in a real trianguar phase. More I think stock market followed bitcoin now for the first big investors coming in.

Last but not least the first ETF will finally be approved the next week. Altough they talk already a long time about the ETF, maybe some big investors know more about it. And I am sure they do.",1539296025,11/10/2018 22:13:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9nei1f/another_idea_why_the_stock_market_dumped_in/,1

A link for those who were wondering. I was always an enthusiast for crypto USAGE (not just hodling). However, as it stands right now it's really risky to do business online with it as it is not protected like paypal. Although there is nobody touching the money when you don't want it - it's tough to have sales because of the fear. I noticed that openbazaar used an escrow service - but was a little off-putting for most people because it's on a completely separate platform. Most people aren't really willing to change their behavior that much. So I decided to make a group on facebook that deals with crypto only. Rules are generally the same as all other buy/sell pages except for the use of an escrow service.

Bitcoin Financialization / Independent Audits,Outside of having your own Bitcoin at addresses that you control in your own wallet how does the average person know that the bitcoin volume quoted at these large exchanges is real. I mean isn't there some way that the average person who runs a full node can examine the utxo set to confirm trading activity as well as how many bitcoins exist and at which addresses?  Otherwise how do we even know that any of what the exchange quotes state are legitimate in terms of volume or price? I would imagine that they could be Financializing Bitcoin because there's no transparency as far as I'm aware. It seems like they can just coordinate amongst themselves and say there x amount of volume at x price.  How would we know?  I mean it seems like they would be able to control the price if there's no way for us to know how many Bitcoin they actually have and where on a blockchain they are located. Maybe someone out there can help me see this more clearly but from where I stand this seems like it can be very effective way to manipulate and control the price of Bitcoin.,1539298833,11/10/2018 23:00:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9neva7/bitcoin_financialization_independent_audits/,1

Art imitates life(my thoughts on how what we are witnessing is truly epic),"I wrote this as a reply to someone who asked me what the fed is dealing with right now. I am sharing it because it made me realize how truly worthy of a movie this all is. One day we might watch said movie and think back to how crazy of a time this is economically:
The fed is trying to reverse the course it has been on for the past ten years. They are trying to get rates to the ""normal"" range after being so low for so long. The problem is that it affects the price of bonds in a way that the 2 year bond becomes more expensive than the ten year bond. This is called a ""yield curve inversion"". Every time this has happened a recession has come within 6-12 months of that. Also, rising bond rates entices investors to become interested in bonds again because they are a safe way to make money (for obvious reasons). This obviously pulls money from the stock market because people are trying to diversify their portfolios and find ways to make money. If you Google the Dow Jones average the past couple of days you will see there is a major correction going on. Also, trump knows this is what's happening and has publicly made statements about how he thinks the fed is being too aggressive with the rate hikes. It's dangerous to invert the yield curve right now because rates are still historically low. This is dangerous because the fed typically lowers rates during recessions to take pressure off the economy to help turn it around. If they don't have the tools they need to fight off a recession we might have to go back into another round of quantitative easing and might even face negative interest rates and another ""great recession"" or worse. Imagine a bank account that takes money out of your account because you park it there? Bonds won't yield anything and stocks/house prices will shoot through the roof again because that's the only place investors will be able to make/protect their money. The only place besides bitcoin, of course. The government won't be able to touch that and bakkt will allow pretty much anyone an onramp. Also, trade wars are adding to the pressure of all of this. It's some pretty fucked up stuff. So if the stock market goes through more of these corrections or even encounters a crash, the publics sentiment of what bitcoin is will be visible by seeing how the price holds up. If the price remains relatively stable... Then WOW. Buy some more because we will have something outside of government control that people truly believe in. This really is like the season finale to the bitcoin saga. Real life really does write the best stories sometimes. The timing of all this couldn't have been any more epic. Unbelievable.""

# ELI5

Statechains let you spend bitcoins without using the bitcoin blockchain (""off-chain""). Spending the bitcoins requires the help of a third party. If they don't help, you can also do it without their help on the bitcoin blockchain. A little bit of trust is required.

&amp;#x200B;

# ELI15

You lock up bitcoins on-chain with a third party -- the Statechain entity. In order to transfer the bitcoins, you sign a message telling the entity that you want to move the coins to a new owner. You simultaneously pass on your transitory key to that new owner, meaning both of you have equal control over the coins. The entity ensures that only the wishes of the last owner get fulfilled. If they misbehave, it is easily detectable.

&amp;#x200B;

# ELI25

Bob (B) locks up coins with Statechain entity A, but instead of using his key B, he creates and uses a transitory key X (this private key will be exposed to future owners). An off-chain timelock transaction will be created back to B, ensuring the coins return to Bob in case of a dispute. If Bob wants to send his coins to Carol, he does three things:

* He signs a message stating he wants to transfer the coins to Carol (signed by B and C)
* Together with the entity, he signs a bitcoin timelock transaction for Carol (signed by A and X)
* These signatures are swapped atomically using Adaptor Signatures (preventing problems with aborting the protocol)

We use Eltoo to ensure the new timelock transaction takes precedence over the old one(s). Multiple UTXOs can be swapped simultaneously as well. For more details, check out the [presentation](http://youtu.be/FI9cwksTrQs?t=47m36s) and [paper](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Avm99d6Nf8PGgp414rF-49twiypBOQ).

&amp;#x200B;

# FAQ

&amp;#x200B;

**Q1**: *If I have 1 BTC locked up on a Statechain, can I send less than that amount?*

**A1:** You can think of Statechains as the equivalent of real-life coins. In order to send less, you will first have to trade your 1 BTC for smaller amounts. E.g. You can swap your 1 BTC coin for two 0.5 BTC coins. You can do this trade with anyone who is online and willing. Alternatively, you can create a Lightning channel on top of a Statechain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2:** *How does Lightning function on top of Statechains?*

**A2:** It ends up working quite elegantly. If Bob wants to send coins to Carol, he can create a channel instead. From the perspective of the Statechain, this means both Bob and Carol must agree before the coins can move, and they can proceed to build their Lightning channel on top of it. Because channel creation happens off-chain, you gain some tremendous benefits. It becomes very easy to recreate the channel, and add or remove funds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3:** *Aren't Statechains less secure than Lightning?*

**A3:** Yes, you're making a trade-off. The Statechain entity should be a federation of multiple entities, similar to Liquid. This means a majority needs to become dishonest before you can lose money. They also require the cooperation of a prior owner (someone that knows the transitory key) before they can steal anything. Theoretically we can add an extra layer of security by using Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to transfer the transitory key, but this technology is not mature enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4:** *Why not just use federated sidechains instead?*

**A4:** The transitory key adds additional security. If the federation goes rogue, they will only be able to obtain a small subset of all transitory keys. As soon as they steal any coins, people without compromised transitory keys can safely withdraw on-chain. This is because you can always redeem your coins on the bitcoin blockchain without specifically asking the federation for permission. From a legal perspective, the entity cannot be seen as a money transmitter, because they lack direct access to the transitory keys (similar to greenaddress), so the barrier to operating a Statechain is much lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q5:** *How does this compare to Lightning channel factories?*

**A5:** Lightning channel factories require less security trade-offs, but you can only change channels with the people inside your factory, and it requires all of them to be online. Anthony Towns and Olaoluwa Osuntokun ( u/roasbeef ) pointed out that factories can be useful on top of Statechains, because it lowers the required number of on-chain UTXOs per user, and you can add/remove users from the factory off-chain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q6:** *What are my options if I want to exit a Statechain?*

**A6:** Everyone has a valid on-chain transaction that they can use at any time to redeem their bitcoins, but it is more efficient to close the channel cooperatively. Assuming graftroot gets adopted, this would be the ideal way to exit the system, because it allows the owner to decide what the redemption transaction will look like, and it even gives them the ability to withdraw coins from different bitcoin hard forks (if any occurred during the time the coins were in the Statechain). This solves the problem of uncertainty over which coins will be honored in case of a hard fork (ETF, exchanges, etc).

UEBOT - Cloud-based Automated Bitcoin Trading Robot,"https://i.redd.it/lw05j8913pr11.png

**UEBOT - Cloud-based Automated Bitcoin Trading Robot**

**Alternative to investing in cryptocurrency directly**

**Exceeds the same period bitcoin benchmark return (371% Compound Annual Return from 2013 to 2018)**  
 

**What kind of people are suitable for using UEBOT?**

The high volatility of digital assets has attracted many traditional ordinary investors, but when many ordinary investors investing in digital assets, they don‚Äôt know when to take profit to maximize the profit during the bull market cycle, they don‚Äôt know how to stop loss and minimize the risk of loss during the bear market cycle. In a complete market, the alternate cycle of bulls and bears does not know how to achieve steady growth of assets, but also is repeatedly harvested by professional investors, watching their investment assets or income shrink.

In this context, we created the UEBOT Cloud-based Automated Bitcoin Trading Robot Service. While helping us grow rapidly with the help of our client capital, we defended our hopes through years of experience in digital asset arbitrage and quantitative trading techniques. The interests of ordinary investors with long-term investment help them to achieve steady growth of assets regardless of whether the market is in a bull market or a bear market cycle, and avoid repeated harvesting by professional investors.

Therefore, UEBOT is suitable for high-net-worth long-term investors who are expected to enjoy high returns on digital assets while maintaining sustained and steady growth and with certain risk tolerance.  
 

**Why choose UEBOT?**

Use the Cloud-based Automated Bitcoin Trading Robot Service to enjoy the following unparalleled investment advantages:

‚úìCustomers can receive excess returns over their holdings of digital assets during the same period, with an average compound annualized yield of over 200%

‚úìThe investment risk is lower, the maximum retracement of UEBOT is about 60%, which is far lower than the maximum retracement of holding 90% of digital assets. At the same time, the income/risk plan can be formulated according to user risk preference.

‚úìUEBOT conducts transactions on behalf of customers through the user account API KEY. The customer manages the assets themselves and manages the assets on the account at any time. Unlike fundraising investment tools such as equity or funds, the assets are managed by others and have a lock-up period. The withdrawal mechanism is restricted, and there is a risk that the funds will not be retrieved if they are absconded with money.

‚úìCustomer assets can maintain steady and sustained growth regardless of bull market or bear market.  
 

**About us**

UEBOT is a cloud-based Bitcoin arbitrage robot service operated by RCHANGE, a well-known electronic money exchange service established in 2012. From 2012 to the end of 2017, RCHANGE is from more than 100,000 individual customers and well-known digital asset exchanges worldwide (bitfinex/btc) -e/okcoin/huobi) provides exchange services for electronic money (such as Perferct Money and Tether, etc.).  
 

**Advantages**  
 

As we know, long-term holding of cryptocurrency can achieve higher returns. However, holding cryptocurrency is only a unilateral going long market, and market prices are unlikely to continue to rise. Usually, when the market rises to a certain high level, it will be accompanied by a large drawdown, unable to maintain sustained growth.

UEBOT uses the API KEY created by the user-supplied cryptocurrency exchange account, and the entire process is automated to perform trading operations on the cryptocurrency exchange account.

UEBOT will do long market and short market in the process of automated trading, and hedge arbitrage through market volatility. As long as there is fluctuation in the market, there will be profit opportunities, so assets can maintain steady and sustained growth.

This is the main reason why UEBOT investment income exceeds the benchmark income of cryptocurrency during the same period.  
 

**Funds Under Your Management**

We are not collective investment scheme.We only provide cloud-based automated bitcoin trading robot technology services.

Customers only authorization the API trading permissions of cryptocurrency trading platforms account to UEBOT, ensuring that the funds in the account are entirely controlled by the customers.

Moreover, customers can adjust accounts assets at any time according to their needs.  
 

**Principal Protected**

Most investment instruments has risks of loss, and UEBOT is no exception. But we have many years of experience in solid disk quantification, usually we can get excess returns more than one year by using UEBOT. If UEBOT still cause losses to our customers after one year, we will compensate the customer for all losses due to the UEBOT trading strategy.

Guide To Buying Your First Bitcoin In Singapore.,"Over the past few days, i have been searching for a guide for new Singaporeans to get their first Bitcoin.

**A Guide To Buying Your First Bitcoin In Singapore**

What Is Bitcoin?  
   
 

It is a digital currency based on the blockchain technology. The currency is completely free from any central authority and transactions are fast and secure.

Bitcoin was envisioned as a utility coin that was meant to take over real money. However, users have found more value in trading the cryptocurrency as an investment commodity. 

Where To Buy Bitcoin In Singapore?

As a Singaporean, we have access to a huge number of both local and overseas exchanges. But for a beginner, I would recommend using some of the platform which has simple User Interface(UI) as the exchanges might be too complicated or intimidating for a new user. Below are the 3 platform that I would recommend.

1.Coinbase:US-Based

2.Coinhako:SG-Based

3.Cryptaw:SG-Based

4.Gemini:US-Based

Through this article, I hope you find the exchange that best suits you. From my experience, I started out using Coinbase. But due to the higher fees and bank fees, I decided to switch to Coinhako after finding out more about them. I used Coinhako for slightly over a year and faced very minimal issues, but most of the time I will have to solve them myself as it takes up to a week for Coinhako Support Team to get back to me regarding my issues. Earlier this year, I came to know of Cryptaw through a friend and after some studying, I decided to switch over to Cryptaw as they solve a few issues I face with Coinhako. No doubt Cryptaw charge a 0.2% higher trading fee, but for the convenience that I am getting with their Bank Transfers deposit and higher trade limit, it is definitely worth it. The reason why I included Gemini was because a few of my friends are trading using Gemini and they told me Gemini provides better support. But in my opinion, Cryptaw is good enough for me as I have never faced any issues with them and their Support Team usually replies within a day.

  

TL;DR: I am using Cryptaw

  

Note: Trading of cryptocurrencies involves significant level of risk. Prices of goods, regardless of their nature or substance, have no permanent nature and are subject to constant change. Price fluctuations directly affect the value of assets held by an individual over time. Any good - virtual or not - can both gain value and become worthless over time. Due to the fundamentals of the cryptocurrency trading system‚Äôs functioning, it is vulnerable to fluctuations in the level of confidence of market participants, which directly affects the level of demand or supply. The level of confidence can be affected both by purely economic factors and non-economic, including technological ones. Given the above, please thoughtfully decide whether the existing degree of risk involved in the cryptocurrency trading is acceptable for you.

An easter egg in the Bitcoin genesis block code,"I'm surprised no one has ever found this before. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at the original code for bitcoin on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/133/tree/trunk/main.cpp#l1616), we can see this comment on line 1616:

      // txNew.vin[0].scriptSig     = 486604799 4 0x736B6E616220726F662074756F6C69616220646E6F63657320666F206B6E697262206E6F20726F6C6C65636E61684320393030322F6E614A2F33302073656D695420656854 

This is basically the signature that is meant to link it to the previous block. Since this is the genesis block, there is not previous block so the content can be anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, lets take that hash and run it through a simple [HEX to TEXT converter](https://www.browserling.com/tools/hex-to-text):

**0x736B6E616220726F662074756F6C69616220646E6F63657320666F206B6E697262206E6F20726F6C6C65636E61684320393030322F6E614A2F33302073656D695420656854** 

=

**sknab rof tuoliab dnoces fo knirb no rollecnahC 9002/naJ/30 semiT ehT**

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting, no?

Everyone knows about the encoded message ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"" but it's also hidden the the tx hash, but mirrored.

Discussion: Current state of currency,"Market forces are a tug of war.  In the current age of Bitcoin we are seeing more institutional investors, which means more bots. With the current dip, I suspect that a lot of value is controlled by bots these days, and the authors of these machines view coin in a similar light to tech stock - which had an identical depreciation.  By contrast we are seeing more adoption by individual in countries who cannot rely upon a stable currency; Venezuela, Zimbabwe, India, and increasingly China.  A large basket of currencies are largely backed by the Renminbi which has seen a lot of turbulence in the past few months - which could be a very good thing for Bitcoin.  Uncertainty moves markets, and there seems to be uncertainty in spades these days.

Can I get advice on where to market my bitcoin exchange site?,"Hey, Reddit bitcoiners.  Thanks in advance for any advice.   I set up a very simple exchange (just bitcoin/usd).  We do a couple of special features, but we realize we are in a commodity service and, other than good service, it may be difficult to distinguish ourselves.  We are finally banked and open for business. 

Obvious first strategies would be to allow people in markets with restrictions to sell coins for cash (China, Venezuela, Zimbabwe). It seems it would be no problem to wire them money, although vice versa would be difficult.  

Where is it \*really\* hard to buy or sell bitcoin?  It seems like  that would be a logical place for us to market.

Thanks!  Irish Nick

Guys lets rally and show your support for an BTC ETF! Here's why!,"Guys, the first SEC BTC ETF public feedback site had **1,300+ comments from fine folks like yourself**. The final one which imo is way more important has just received **90 comments** since it came online on Sept 20. :( I understand the mood's changed, but let's finish what we started and get this across the line!

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know people are sick of BTC dumping whenever the SEC rejects/delays a BTC ETF but I think we need to give this a final push! Here are my reasons: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Ever heard the term, ""so close but so far?"" I think the crypto market is on the verge of one of the biggest bullruns in history but we need that final push. The last SEC inviting the public to file public statements on a BTC ETF garnered 1,300+ comments!!! I don't think they've ever received anything like this and since then, the SEC has taken a much softer tone due to the sheer interest in a BTC ETF.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Yes, we don't need an ETF and the first one is really only designed for big buyers, however the success of the first Bitcoin ETF will open up the doors for a plethora of dozens to come. Every person in the world should own some Bitcoin and this is one of the first steps to making it happen. Remember, not every person has the technical knowhow of buying and keeping their Bitcoin safe. Think of your grandparents!

&amp;#x200B;

3) Crypto constantly gets bombarded with lots of ""negative"" press in the media. Thousands of people have had their bank accounts frozen, closed, and it's STILL happening every day! My dad, who represents the public is against crypto due to these scare tactics by the media, however a thumbs up from the SEC will quickly change crypto's image across the financial world &amp; media.

&amp;#x200B;

4) A lot of people here are down 60% or more.¬†Who are we kidding, everyone who invested in crypto is in it for the money. The tech is a bonus. Maybe not the CBOE BTC ETF, but the upcoming ETF's will unleash an epic bullrun. Billions of real $$ will flow in from traditional finance. One day, you'll turn on the local news channel and they'll not just report on closing numbers for US Dow, S&amp;P 500, Gold, Oil but Bitcoin as well! How cool would that be?

&amp;#x200B;

5) It literally takes 5 minutes to fill in this form. If an ETF finally gets approved, wouldn't you feel ""great"" that you ""might"" of helped in some way? 

&amp;#x200B;

6) Why public opinion matters? There's an interesting doco recently released on Netflix called ""A Leaf of Faith"". In it, the DEA was about to ban ""Kratom"", but stopped due to public outcry. A single supporter managed to get a spot on the Joe Rogan show. After it aired, thousands of public comments hammered the DEA website which led to them re-considering the ban. Government's work for the people. We need to rally behind something we believe in!

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument: ""We don't need an ETF, SEC may/may not approve a Bitcoin ETF one day, but it does not matter.""**

This is true, if BAKKT interest is high, we may not need an ETF, however, we're very close to BAKKT opening and the market is not responding well. Besides, we managed to hit 1300+ comments on the SEC website and now they are asking for a final say, why give up at the last hour?? Let's be realistic. If BAKKT under performs, and an ETF is delayed for another 2-3 years, Bitcoin may drop back under $3,000. This would just give banks more time to ""load up"". In fact, financial institutions will just wait until it falls so low before they acquire everything and become mega crypto landlords. Think of this as hedging our bets between ETF &amp; BAKKT! Look around at what is happening now. Folks are falling out of favor with crypto currencies. Trading volume has dropped off a cliff and down 80% in some markets. The markets were expecting institutional money to flow in, but so far it's nearly non-existent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument: ""Crypto doesn't need greedy banks/wall street.""**

I agree, but it's clear the market doesn't hold that belief. Ultimately, everything falls back to simple supply vs demand. If there's no new money coming in to support the price, it will dump. An ETF approval signals to the market that the SEC have changed their view and more ETFs will come online. This means massive amounts of ""fresh"" money will support Bitcoin. If all US pension funds just invest 5% of their allocation in Bitcoin, we will see $100,000 Bitcoin! Why wait for stuff to happen when you can be a part of it and it takes just a few minutes?

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument: ""An ETF is just one market riding on another, it's exclusively a financial instrument and has no connections to any real trade / value exchanges. This is exactly the sort of financial nonsense that a finite and distributed currency like bitcoin is trying to get away from and bitcoin ETFs keep fiat users away from actually using bitcoin.""**

A regulated ETF opens up access to Bitcoin investment to more traditional organisations. Pension funds being the obvious one. While a pension fund could go and buy actual Bitcoin's I doubt they are (a) allowed by law or (b) motivated to make such special effort for one asset class. In that sense, a Bitcoin ETF adds a feature to Bitcoin: holdable by more conservative organisations. A holder is a user, and more users makes a currency stronger.""

&amp;#x200B;

**How to file a public comment and help approve BTC ETF:**

Find and click on ""**Submit Comments on SR-CboeBZX-2018-040**"" 

Remember, Public opinion matters. Be heard!

&amp;#x200B;

YES There's going to be people here saying ""Who cares. Sc\*\* the ETF"". To these people, I say ""an ETF doesn't harm Bitcoin, it just makes it stronger. You're not selling your kidneys! It's just 5 minutes of your time.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you and god bless Satoshi!

Benefit to Bitcoin hodlers during a stock market crash,"""Stomach"" is a phenomenal attribute for long-term investing.

A common fault in investing behavior is panic-selling during a market downturn, and failing to re-enter before  reversion to upturn. It's been shown that staying the course and enduring all market conditions has been a winning investment mindset over the long-term.  For many, this is easier said than done. 

A small portion of my investments are in crypto.  After enduring the volatility of the past two years, I find myself comparatively numb to fluctuations in the stock market.  I am more confident I can psychologically handle a recession and come out ahead.

Buda.com adds Lightning Network payment for Latin America,"Redditors!

I work as and advisor at[ Buda.com](https://buda.com/) and I have awesome news to share with you.

As most of you at /r/Bitcoin probably already know, in addition to being a way to pay Bitcoins with very low fees and practically infinite scalability, the main feature of the Lightning Network is that it is built as a layer on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain, so it provides a decentralized protocol where you don't have to trust intermediaries.

Most of LN wallets that are being developed in the world have a strong focus on decentralization, and that‚Äôs very good news. As what is sought is that the user does not depend on anyone, these applications generally include a lightning node and a sometimes even a bitcoin node, which allows monitoring transactions on their own. The problem is that this keeps some users out, as installation, configuration and use is still a bit difficult for many.

At[ Buda.com](https://buda.com/) even though we're an exchange, we are also convinced that the future is going towards total decentralization, so we know we will have to reinvent ourselves eventually. But we also know that along the way the world needs some temporary centralized services that allow less technical users (or with less time!) to try and use this technology. This will surely allow the ecosystem of crypto payments to keep growing while more decentralized solutions mature. As long as the base protocol is decentralized, competition in the long run will move intermediaries (even part of our current business model) out of the way.

Therefore, after much effort we are very happy to tell you that from today we are giving the possibility to any Buda.com user to pay in Bitcoins using Lightning Network without having any technical knowledge at all. All accounts now have a simple way to pay with Lightning and payments will be deducted directly from their Bitcoin balance in the exchange.

For those who do have more technical knowledge and want to try on their own, we invite them to connect directly to our [Lightning node](https://1ml.com/node/0282734a2ca9bdca61859c71efdc43234ea664ecba9a785f780c6eec8c80243b45) ",1539357493,12/10/2018 15:18:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9nl59s/budacom_adds_lightning_network_payment_for_latin/,1

Winklevoss Twins' Gemini Crypto Exchange Gets Regulatory Green Light for Litecoin Trading,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 1ivwx4kb6sr11...*

U.S.-based¬†cryptocurrency¬†exchange¬†Gemini, owned by the¬†Winklevoss twins, has sealed regulatory approval to add Litecoin (LTC) custody and trading.

Gemini‚Äôs vice president of engineering, Eric Winer, informs Gemini traders that they can begin depositing Litecoin into their exchange accounts as of 9:30 am EDT Saturday, Oct. 13. Litecoin trading will reportedly go live Tuesday, October 16th at 9:30 am EDT.

The coin is set to be the fourth crypto supported on the platform, alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Zcash (ZEC). Consequently, LTC trading pairs will be available against all three cryptos, as well as against the U.S. dollar.

The Differences between BTC and Bcash?,"Hi!

Thanks in advance for any help...

Can the community explain as simply - and objectively - as possible what the main/important differences between Bitcoin (core?!) And Bitcoin Cash are?

I find the opinions of this quite polarizing and seemingly subjective:

1) Roger Ver's heavily biased ""facts""

2) BTC loyalists trolling of BCash.

In laypersons' terms, what are the differences I should know if a beginner were to inquire about it? What does BCash have going for it that BTC or Ether doesn't?

THANK you in advance!!!

"What's the best ""elevator pitch"" to merchants, coming from a customer?","In the interest of boosting merchant adoption, I know it's been suggested before to simply ask ""Do you accept Bitcoin?"" when shopping in person at stores, such that even if the answer is ""no"", they then know there's someone out there interested in paying in it.

As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gotten more media time and are entering the common vocabulary more, I'd suspect the answer from the merchant might be along the lines of ""No, but I'm interested in starting"". In that situation, what are the best options/suggestions to offer them? I'm working on putting together a presentation to help local users of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies be good advocates and sources of information for merchants wishing to get started, and I'd love any feedback you have to share!

With the Segregated Witness (SegWit) feature rollout last year, it became evident that BitPay (which had been a market-leader for making it easy for merchants to start accepting payments) shifted to be more focused on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sidechain. In its wake, a few others have joined the merchant bridge space, and so from my research I see:

* CoinGate: Good for a plug-and-play option. If a merchant can get a tablet at the checkout counter, just install the CoinGate app on it, and you're good to go.
* BTCPayServer: Lowest fees, since you host it yourself. Requires a bit more technical know-how, but good if looking for the lowest per transaction fees.

In theory the lowest-tech way to get started as a merchant is to print out a QR code for an address and slap that on the checkout counter. Are there any tools out there that help a merchant manage that sort of setup a bit nicer? (e.g. creating a nicely-formatted sign with the QR code, like the BitAddress.org ""paper wallet"" artwork, but full-page-sized? Or tools for using an HD wallet to generate new addresses/QR codes on a daily/weekly basis?)",1539379818,12/10/2018 21:30:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9noc13/whats_the_best_elevator_pitch_to_merchants_coming/,1

"Bitcoin wiki example for checking WIF key validity, hash doesn't match!?","So I was navigating the wiki in the pages about WIF addresses and etc.

There are steps to convert from base-58 to HEX, then removing the checksum and sha256 hashing it twice, and so on. [I linked to the webpage but previous post got removed, so just google bitcoin wiki WIF etc]

This is where I'm puzzled. Hashes do not match the results I get using any other tool.

Bitcoin wiki says that the hash of

`800C28FCA386C7A227600B2FE50B7CAE11EC86D3BF1FBE471BE89827E19D72AA1D`

is

`8147786C4D15106333BF278D71DADAF1079EF2D2440A4DDE37D747DED5403592`

But if you go to any online hash website, hashing that string gives

`E2E4146A36E9C455CF95A4F259F162C353CD419CC3FD0E69AE36D7D1B6CD2C09`

So what is going on here?

BTC ‚Äúthe mother of all bubbles‚Äù said Roubini - Are you going to keep your cash in your bank on the next creditcrunch ?," **Roubini**  who predicted the financial crisis of 2008 - thousands smart guys did predict that not only Roubini. It is a typically behaviour for an economist to predict hoping they'll be right in the future to gain fame over it.

* **the mother of all bubbles** \- it's like saying Internet is the the mother of all bubbles, or the stock . Anything can be.
*  **favoured by ‚Äúcharlatans and swindlers‚Äù**  \- Roubini forgot to mention all the crapy gambling products the banks are selling to the poor investors (calls and puts etc) . Products that worth nothing and make people loose more of what they invest while the chances to win are almont 2% .
*  **use by criminals and people evading tax** \- the most rubbish statement . Anything can be and is used for this purpose starting from the real estate to stocks and fiat. I mean the VAT fraud b EU is at 200  bln $, the drugtraffic 350 bln$ . This was not driven by BTC .
* **Market crashed hence BTC worth nothing** \- yes but the dot-com did exist and yet companies like RedHat did recover from 130$ down to 3$/share and now back to 150$. It does not means the coin/project or company are crap because the market crashed 
* **Many scams &amp; pumps and dumps** \- that's the only point where I Agree with Roubini and this is where he has to focus his brain to help with. Genuine concern that needs to support to clean up the space from all the crap.

"Scam Victim Loses $48,000 Claim Against Canadian Bitcoin ATM Firm","**A woman suing for 62,500 Canadian dollars ($48,125) sent to a phone scammer over a bitcoin ATM has lost her court case, local media reported. On Friday, Charlottetown Provincial Court chief judge Nancy Orr ruled that the fiat money deposited by the woman into the teller machine belonged to Instacoin ATM Canada Inc., owners of the digital cash dispensing unit.**

***Also read:¬†Funny New Advert Shows Bitcoin Is on Google‚Äôs Mind***

## ‚ÄòUnfortunate Victim of Sophisticated Fraud‚Äô

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs most unfortunate that she was victim of such a sophisticated fraud,‚Äù judge Orr is¬†quoted as saying, when she handed down her decision. However, she added that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to the bitcoin purchaser to know what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The woman, unnamed for security reasons, deposited 62,500 Canadian dollars into a bitcoin automated teller machine believing she owed taxes. It was a fraud. A man claiming to represent the Canada Revenue Agency called her, threatening the new immigrant with arrest and deportation for tax default.

According to a¬†report by CBC News, the case centered on who legally owned the money she deposited into the ATM, later seized by police in cash.¬†In court, the woman spoke of how the scammer had her on speed dial, and of the intimate detail he held about her family. She testified that as a new immigrant, she believed the threats of arrest and deportation and that this could be avoided by sending the large sum of money demanded.

Over two days in February, the woman made a series of withdrawals from her bank, which she deposited into a bitcoin machine at a restaurant in Charlottetown, said the article. She transferred the money to a bitcoin address supplied to her by the unknown man on the phone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard. I need that money back,‚Äù the woman told local media, tearfully. ‚ÄúI want other people to know what happened to me, so it doesn‚Äôt happen to them,‚Äù she sobbed.

## Bitcoin ATM Fraud Rising in Canada

Incidences of bitcoin scams are¬†on the rise¬†in Canada. In November last year, police said more than 40 people had lost 300,000 Canadian dollars to phone scammers, who compel victims to make bitcoin ATM deposits on the threat of arrest for tax default.

&amp;#x200B;

In Charlottetown, lawyer Michael Drake, representing Instacoin ATM Canada Inc., ‚Äúargued that the company merely provided a financial service to the woman, by converting cash to bitcoin currency, and sending it to the computer address she provided,‚Äù the report said. The woman supplied the bitcoin address of an unknown telephone fraudster, in this case, it detailed.

Jonathan Coady, the woman‚Äôs legal counsel, argued that at the time of the ATM deposit, the woman acted ‚Äúunder duress.‚Äù The judge wouldn‚Äôt have it. ‚ÄúBoth sides involved in this case are completely sympathetic to the woman‚Ä¶but Instacoin did not put her under duress,‚Äù said judge Orr, adding that while anonymity was a key feature of cryptocurrency, it was also its weakness where cases of fraud are concerned.

Ex-Bitmain Chip Designer Takes on Crypto's Mining Goliath,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img r114dorpiyr11...*

At Yang Zuoxing‚Äôs modest office a short drive from the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing, desks are strewn with cryptocurrency mining equipment and cots stand ready for engineers too exhausted to go home after marathon days at work.

This is Yang‚Äôs bunker as he fights an uphill battle against Bitmain Technologies -- his old employer and the world‚Äôs dominant provider of crypto mining chips -- that may include an initial public offering for Yang‚Äôs two-year-old startup as soon as next year.

Yang says he helped Bitmain design its market-leading technology but left the company in June 2016 after co-founders Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan turned down his request for a stake in the business. Yang started his own crypto chip company, MicroBT, a month later. He now claims his firm‚Äôs mining gear is just as...

I own crypto but not Bitcoin.,"I own crypto but not Bitcoin.

When I ask friends, colleagues or other people who are into cryptocurrencies if they own Bitcoin, almost all of them respond with ""I own crypto but not Bitcoin"". Then explaining me why Bitcoin is old and slow and that &lt;insert CoinMarketCap top 10 coin&gt; will soon supersede/surpass Bitcoin.

As a Bitcoin fanboy (or maximalist), I try to point them on a few facts about Bitcoin and why I think Bitcoin is still king and a better store-of-value than all the others. However, it is hard to convince them and I believe thats because they suffer from, as I call it, the ""missing boat effect"".

They probably feel like they missed the boat on Bitcoin and now just look at the next coin which is cheaper. So they buy all kinds of other coins except Bitcoin and are completely ignoring what makes Bitcoin so strong and great.

Does anyone else recognize this?

Lightning Network: is it here yet?,"Every few months I make this post. I‚Äôve been in this community a long time, since back when BTC was less than $100.

One of the main advantages I used to tell people about was very low transaction costs and fast speed. Ever since those started changing, I‚Äôve stopped being interested in bitcoin. But there was hope: the lightning network.

Now every few months I think about it again, and I ask this subreddit about it. I‚Äôve been seeing some stuff about it lately so: **what‚Äôs the current status on the lightning network?** is it finally being used?",1539439713,13/10/2018 14:08:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9nu050/lightning_network_is_it_here_yet/,1

Question on discounts and accepting Bitcoin as payment,"I want to give customers discounts on my shop if they pay with Bitcoin. (but I also accept Paypal at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

But a recent paypal policy change makes it look like they're going to give me trouble in the future. (see section ""1.5 Presentation of PayPal"" here: [https://www.paypal.com/bm/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full](https://www.paypal.com/bm/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full))

My TLDR understanding of that section implies that you can't give preferential discounts based on which payment method the client chooses.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just ditch Paypal altogether?? I'm seriously thinking about it.

ETFs - European with a query (and concern),"**Query:**
With an ETF regulation approved by the SEC for BTC-backed products, would a company offering an ETF be able to sell off a % of their customers' holdings if they believed that the market was bearish? And if they suddenly believed that BTC's value would increase, would they be able to buy (pump) a % of their customers' deposited fiat in BTC for them? I.e. does it allow them to control their customers' investments to this extent?


**My generic thoughts on ETFs:**
I'm okay with ETFs as it allows companies to deal with investors' Private Keys - something that's needed to facilitate the process for adoption, and for improved security since they would have to be trained and knowledgeable in this area. If the ETF were not backed by BTC, then they can blow things out of proportion, and 'promise' customers too much BTC, that for them to actually acquire that amount, it would increase the price by way too much, that they can never really but that amount, and customers would lose the BTC they thought they bought. Another point that bothers me is that we'll start to see ETFs first be available to large institutions only. Regular people wouldn't be able to afford the high capital the investments will require. This means that it's not a fair playingground. But hey, does fair even exist?


**Back to my question...**
However, if the ETF company can control their customers' investments, then I'd have a problem with that. In essence, they become a whale. They could claim to believe that the market would go bearish simply to have an excuse to dump. They could do the same to pump the market. It puts them in a position where they can make pump and dumps in a legal manner.",1539459016,13/10/2018 19:30:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9nwj27/etfs_european_with_a_query_and_concern/,1

"Will we need transaction-value depending fees, is it fair?","If we would look far ahead enough, eventually no BTC rewards,  or if BTC value would not rise in value as fast as it has been rising, the mining task will not be primarily paid by the value of mined BTC, but more and more by the transaction fees.

When we get there we could choose to keep the current fee system, independent of the value of an transaction, in place and it would lead to, much, higher fees.

Or we could go to a fee system that takes into account the amount of an transaction.
Small transaction would remain cheap, and higher value transactions would be charged more.

With current rewards of 1800 BTC every day total value would be ~ 12.000.000 $/day 
We could divide total costs by total value transferred ~500.000.000 $/day what would give us a cost of ~ 0,0024$/$ transferred. 

If we divide total costs by number of transactions ~250.000 /day we get a cost of 48$/transaction.

Only from above numbers it would make more sense to make fees transaction-value depending.
a lowest fee would have to remain to prevent spamming of the network.

I didn't take into account that this variable fee would reduce a lot of current big transactions ( I would guess it would) nor that currently we also pay a, small, fee that should be included in above calculations.

Would like to hear other thoughts or arguments.

How would I go about reporting a bug in Bitcoin core?,Unfortunately it appears that I may have found a bug that I'm not comfortable disclosing publicly yet in Bitcoin core. As far as I can tell this bug will not have any major impact of how the network operates or how the currency app is for that matter but just to be on the safe side I'd like to go ahead and submit it to the people responsible for maintaining the code directly and anonymously. Can anyone out there give me any suggestion on how to go about submitting this apparent bug report to the appropriate people for them to take the necessary actions to remedy this?

Intensive to mine for the BTC chain after every BTC is mined,"Hi, I would like to ask if someone could explain me why someone would mine if every coin is mined.

I always thought the fees would be enough eventually, if enough people use it in transactions at least. But with all the development like lighting network, fees are drastically released. Will it still be interesting to mine with close to zero fees?

I imagine by then there could be companies mining because they have a big stake in BTC or something, but I don't see why an individual would still own a mining rig.",1539471978,13/10/2018 23:06:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ny57u/intensive_to_mine_for_the_btc_chain_after_every/,1

Bitcoin address of blackmailer - Can something be done about this?,"I just noticed this email in my spam folder in which somebody claims to have hacked me and threatens to expose the sites I've visited unless I pay $500 to this Bitcoin address: 1MN7A7QqQaAVoxV4zdjdrnEHXmjhzcQ4Bq.

Unfortunately it appears some people have already fallen for this obvious scam and sent quite a bit of money to that address.

I wonder if it would be possible to monitor that address and see if Bitcoin gets sent to an exchange so that person can be identified.

Hello cjones@

My nickname in darknet is bone90.
I'll begin by saying that I hacked this mailbox (please look on 'from' in your header) more than six months ago,
through it I infected your operating system with a virus (trojan) created by me and have been monitoring you for a long time.

Even if you changed the password after that - it does not matter, my virus intercepted all the caching data on your computer
and automatically saved access for me.

I have access to all your accounts, social networks, email, browsing history.
Accordingly, I have the data of all your contacts, files from your computer, photos and videos.

I was most struck by the intimate content sites that you occasionally visit.
You have a very wild imagination, I tell you!

During your pastime and entertainment there, I took screenshot through the camera of your device, synchronizing with what you are watching.
Oh my god! You are so funny and excited!

I think that you do not want all your contacts to get these files, right?
If you are of the same opinion, then I think that $500 is quite a fair price to destroy the dirt I created.

Send the above amount on my bitcoin wallet: 1MN7A7QqQaAVoxV4zdjdrnEHXmjhzcQ4Bq
As soon as the above amount is received, I guarantee that the data will be deleted, I do not need it.

Otherwise, these files and history of visiting sites will get all your contacts from your device.
Also, I'll send to everyone your contact access to your email and access logs, I have carefully saved it!

Since reading this letter you have 48 hours!
After your reading this message, I'll receive an automatic notification that you have seen the letter.

I hope I taught you a good lesson.
Do not be so nonchalant, please visit only to proven resources, and don't enter your passwords anywhere!
Good luck!",1539476720,14/10/2018 00:25:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9nyogu/bitcoin_address_of_blackmailer_can_something_be/,1

Voidtools 'Everything' is a search tool thats extremely useful at work where i use windows. 

Lot of free open source tools/libraries and free-ware accept donations through paypal.  Paypal however has transaction fees and hidden fees in the exchange rate for international transactions ( up to 5-8%). When I am at work if i see a useful tool that i use i always try to compensate its developers especially if they accept cryto currency.

I dont need to sign in ( ie with paypal and be extorted with fees ) I simply scan a QR code and i am done!

Asking developers of free software and third party libraries is a great way to spread adoption to new people. If you look at the way back machine the crypto links were removed due to lack of interest. But they are back up!

If you find this software useful please consider donating, if you find other useful projects that only have a fucken paypal button teach them about crypto.

"Crypto miners (and traders), how do you keep track of daily profit margins? Also how bout them taxes?"," Hey guys,

So I‚Äôm building a crypto dashboard for miners ( eventually for traders as well)

I‚Äôve just started a company, I‚Äôm partnered with a CPA who specializes in crypto accounting One of his clients is a mining company out of Arizona, pretty small operation but large enough to be profitable. Anyway, they‚Äôve paid my partner a good deal of money to (manually) upload their excel transaction data into their Xero accounting software and to generate monthly reports to show profit/loss and other business metrics

It seems to me that there is a need for a software that will import excel sheets of mining transactions (or integrate with your wallets) and show how much you‚Äôre earning from mining each coin Day by Day and other metrics on a sleek customizable dashboard.

This same software could be used to prep all your tax documents for the IRS if you‚Äôre running your operation like a business and choose to report your taxes

Am I right that there is a need for this software for the crypto mining community?

What do you currently use to track how lucrative it is to mine each type of coin? Considering token prices are constantly changing and rewards are different for each token, it would involve some calculations, reporting and analysis to figure out how to best spend your electricity.. am I right? Wouldn‚Äôt it be sweet to have all that info in a sleek unified dashboard ?

Btw I‚Äôm aware of the competition that exists in the crypto-asset-monitoring and crypto tax spaces and it doesn‚Äôt scare me too much, but if you guys know of other companies doing these things feel free to mention them here, especially if you‚Äôve used their products and can give feedback

For example I‚Äôve been told- by a crypto accountant- that bitcoin.tax is shit

So my application is going to have:

1. A crypto dashboard.. I want this to pack some Magic. No really I want my dashboard to be visually stunning, the kind of thing that gives the user an experience like they stepped into a 3D world that‚Äôs more video game than website.. using ReactJS for this
2. An Excel ingestion engine which parses an excel file and creates appropriate DB nodes. Also does custom functions like send imported data to quickBooks. Currently I have all this coded and I‚Äôve got one client whose using this daily to import data into their quickBooks
3. (When we open this up to not just miners but traders as well ) there‚Äôs going to be a tax preparation suite that ingests data ( in a variety of formats) and after doing the needed calculations (FILO etc) spits out the form that the miner/trader then submits to the IRS
4. integrations with Coinbase Bittrex and all major crypto exchanges, as well as all widely used crypto wallets, so that data can be imported from every crypto-holding entity our users utilize
5. Command line tools for my users to interact with their data and generate reports and stuff like that

All intelligent feedback appreciated! Thanks",1539517391,14/10/2018 11:43:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9o2453/crypto_miners_and_traders_how_do_you_keep_track/,1
Bitcoin Etf: Will the Tail Wag the Dog?,"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-12/etfs-are-driving-the-price-of-gold-more-than-tracking-it

The Etf convo has been beaten like a dead horse. Largely because most conversations around potential Bitcoin ETFs have 1. Been fundamentally opposed to it based on founding BTC principles hoping to keep the traditional financial system away from BTC as much as possible 2. Support an Etf in the belief that an Etf will increase Bitcoin exposure to the masses and thereby significantly increase both demand and price.

I believe the matter is more complicated. While this article only mentions Crypto in passing and does not discuss the the Bitcoin ETFs specifically, it does offer interesting analysis on the effects of ETFs on Gold. While Bitcoin is often considered to be a digital gold; I am not saying there is a true apples to apples comparison between the two assets; or in the effects of ETFs on them if any; just that maybe SOME aspects/effects of Gold ETFs on that market should be evaluated when considering pros/cons of a Bitcoin Etf.

Lightning fast!,"I don't personally have any interest in working on a system that boils down to a complicated and expensive replacement for wire transfers. And I suspect many other developers, including Gavin, don't either. If Gavin decides to lift the cap, I guess you and Gregory could create a separate alt-coin that has hard block size caps  and see how things play out over the long term.


I really don't understand this logic. Yes, it is a fact of life that if you have a system where people are competing, the people who are less efficient will be driven out of business. So there will be fewer people in that business. You seem to be saying that we should subsidize inefficient miners by limiting the block size, therefore driving up fees and making users pay for their inefficiency. All in the name of vague worries about ""too much centralization.""



The cost of a Bitcoin transaction is just absurdly low and will continue to fall in future. It's like nothing at all. Saying Bitcoin is going to get centralized because of high transaction rates is kinda like saying in 1993 that the web can't possibly scale because if everyone used it web servers would fall over and die. Well yes, they would have done, in 1993. But not everyone started using the web overnight and by the time they did, important web sites were all using hardware load balancers and multiple data centers and it was STILL cheap enough that Wikipedia - one of the worlds top websites - could run entirely off donations.",1539524720,14/10/2018 13:45:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9o2t9b/lightning_fast/,1

Yesterday I tried to pay the local bar with Bitcoin....,"Late night with the boys, drinking beer and getting hammered while having some fries to keep us from passing out on empty stomachs. Finally at the end, I waved (like get over here MKX style) at the waittess; when she arrived I asked for the bill and also the bitcoin address of the local Bar. Shockingly she declined my bitcoin payment request with the ""we dont accept bitcoin here"". FUUUUU what? I was furious. I wanted spend my GPU/ASIC hard earned electronic cash that is Bitcoin. But I was unable to. Sadly.

When the waitress returned after I paid with my Fiat money :( I asked her personally if she would accept Bitcoin as a tip, and while asking her the same time she dropped my fiat coins on the wooden floor (which had holes in it) only to see her bend and search for shiny metal on the ground like a house cleaning lady punching for scrub with a tooth brush. 

""A lesson to be learned"" I claimed as she unwillingly reached for new fiat coins from her purse. ""Why is that?"" she replied. ""That wouldn't happen with electronic cash like Bitcoin"" I added and smiled. ""Ahh.."" she moaned and thought for a split second. ""More so,"" I added, ""your boss wouldn't be able to steal ur tips once I personally send u bitcoin directly to you"" I added. ""TRUE!"" She replied. ""Next time I see u, you better wear a nice QRCode with your bitcoin address next to your name"" I said and smiled. 

Then off she went thinking to herself that either that was a lame pickup chat (which it wasn't) or that she can actually steal off her hard earned tips off her greedy boss using the awesomeness of Bitcoin. Alas, I wish more places could accept Bitcoin, even if it includes lame pickup chats and losing fiat. 

Bars, crypto. Women. It makes sense.

Exchange besides Coinbase &amp; Gemini - Instant Buy &amp; Withdraw,"Hi,

I used to have a Coinbase account until they closed the account, but what I liked about Coinbase was that I was able to purchase AND withdraw my bitcoin purchase immediately with ACH purchase without having to transfer the my USD to Coinbase first wait a few days for the funds to be available, and then purchase the coins.  I have now switched to Gemini, but I have to wait for the funds to clear first before I can withdraw the coins, I can purchase the coins before my USD balance is available, but not withdraw.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is there an exchange that will allow me to purchase AND withdraw my coins like Coinbase did without having to wait for my USD balance to clear into the exchange first?

Getting Started with BTCPay Server - Free and Open Source Bitcoin and Lightning Network payment processor,"This post is a sequel to my earlier [Merchant's Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81h1oy/the_merchants_guide_to_accepting_bitcoin_directly/) and the [Ultimate Guide to BTCPay](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f1eqf/the_ultimate_guide_to_btcpay_the_free_and/). Since then, the software has matured, it's more feature-rich, light-weight and easier to install with plenty of documentation and video tutorials available.

## What is BTCPay Server?

BTCPay Server is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin (on-chain and via the Lightning Network) and supported altcoins, directly to your wallet without fees, transaction cost or a middleman via your own full node.

Think of it as a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the third-party. The private keys are never uploaded to the server. There is no address re-use since each invoice generates a new address deriving from your xpubkey. That means increased privacy, security, and censorship-resistance. It's a tool for self-sovereign businesses, organizations or even individuals.

## Who can use BTCPay?

* Merchants with an online or a physical store (connect your store to your BTCPay with one of many integrations or use a Point of Sale app)
* Charities, organizations or content creators (receive donations via POS app or payment button)
* Users who want to deploy Lightning Network node easily
* Users who want to become payment processors for their friends or local community
* Exchanges which want to integrate with BTCPay and allow merchants to receive fiat payments
* Hosting providers which want to offer 1-click deployment to customers
* Developers who want to help and learn

## Why a business should run a full node?

[Read this article](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Why_Your_Business_Should_Use_a_Full_Node_to_Accept_Bitcoin)

## BTCPay vs other payment processors

The most significant advantage of BTCPay over other processors is that it is entirely free and open-source, non-custodial software, created by the community. While most of the other processors hold your Bitcoins, BTCPay allows you to receive payments P2P, directly to your software or hardware wallet.

BTCPay is a self-hosted software. This means that you are your own payment processor. There are no subscriptions, no transaction fees. There's no third-party involvement which significantly increases the censorship-resistance, privacy, and security for you and your customers. Furthermore, BTCPay enables you to become a processor, which means you can charge for registration of your local merchants, or provide a free service to help spread the adoption.

## How to deploy BTCPay Server?

The easiest way is to use a [web-wizard deployment](https://medium.com/@BtcpayServer/launch-btcpay-server-via-web-interface-and-deploy-full-bitcoin-node-lnd-in-less-than-a-minute-dc8bc6f06a3) and launch your BTCPay, Full Bitcoin and LND node in under a minute. Please visit [this page for more deployment methods](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc#deployment).

## How much does it cost to run BTCPay Server?

BTCPay is a 100% free software. You can run it as a self-hosted solution on your local server, or use a hosting provider, which is what a majority of users do. Additionally, you can use a third-party BTCPay host and attach your store to it.

If you choose to host it externally, the price depends on the hosting provider. Be sure to choose a VPS which meets the minimal requirements.

The low-priced VPS servers tested by the community start at around [8.8$/month](https://medium.com/@BtcpayServer/launch-btcpay-server-via-web-interface-and-deploy-full-bitcoin-node-lnd-in-less-than-a-minute-dc8bc6f06a3).

## Is there a list of merchants using BTCPay?

BTCPay is decentralized, non-custodial service, so we don't really have a way of keeping a track on the number of users. However, some community members try to keep a [list of BTCPay stores](https://bitcoinshirt.co/btcpay-stores/).

Best Bitcoin Debit Card/Easy Instant Exchange?,"Okay so I understand that bitcoin debit cards are probably looked down on here, because well they are antithetical to the idea of bitcoin but...

I‚Äôm sick of relying on sites like paxful that has so few verified and trusted BUYERS of bitcoin and local bitcoins just put me on a forced vacation after having 100+ successful trades 100% feedback and fully verified. 

I want to either get a bitcoin debit card (toss up between BitPay or Shift from coinbase) or just find a reliable exchange that utilizes a payment processor where I can immediately have the money in my bank account (I.E Venmo, Zelle). 

So really anyone have experience with BitPay or shift and which would you recommend?

BitN00B: Help with Python/JSON call : getNewAddress(account) - fail,"When making a JSON call, RPC to bitcoind, what is ""account"" parameter in getNewAddress(account).

Does anyone have actual code to demo this?  This is frustrating given how much time I have spent ( a day ),

trying to get this to work in code, trying different things, googling all over, following things to a dead end.

&amp;#x200B;

In my Bitcoin QT, I see no reference to ""account"", I don't know what to put there as a parameter.

&amp;#x200B;

Reference:

 [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original\_Bitcoin\_client/API\_calls\_list#Full\_list](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list#Full_list)

&amp;#x200B;

If I leave it blank, or I make up something to put there, I get a socket timeout.

I can successfully call: getblockchaininfo() (no params), and a few others with no socket timeout, but not getNewAddress.  Anything and everything requiring a parameter fails.

\--

Also if anyone can help, I please need a clear concise example of sending a transaction.  I can find no good code examples on how to create a raw transaction and send with any Python/RPC/Bitcoind library out there.  None.  It should not take more than a few lines of code to send a transaction.

1. set variables in a data structure

2. make a call to send the transaction (that's it).  The library will take params from the data structure, construct a raw transaction, convert that raw transaction to the format it needs when sending over http (json/rpc), as it does and I understand it to work that way.

 I would like to have the raw transaction printed out to debug, both raw transaction and the actual hex code that is sent.

 

 Thank You,

Which Web-Based Wallet Shoild I Use?,"Hi,

I'm new in the cryptocurrency world and i'd like to know which wallet is safer or easy to use for my attempt here. The official Bitcoin website (r/https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/web/) offers three options to storage my coins.

&amp;#x200B;

1-[BTC.com](https://wallet.btc.com/#/setup/register): This project was founded 3 years ago and later was acquired by a chinese company called Bitmain Technologies Limited in 2016. The history of this wallet, at least of what i can research by my self, is almost non-existent (probably because the company was re-branded not so long ago).

2- [Coin.Space](https://coin.space/?network=bitcoin): They don't even have a page in the official wiki of the Bitcoin Foundation, no information regarding to previous management quality of customer wallets. Mixed reviews in their mobile apps both for Android and IOS.

3- [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/info/): The previous history of Bitnifex and BitGo as shown in their [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitGo) doesn't make it trustworthy for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Which one should i choose? Am i being a paranoid or something? I just was told to do some research before choose a company to store my coins. Any recommendations?",1539546196,14/10/2018 19:43:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9o5okc/which_webbased_wallet_shoild_i_use/,1

Why Crypto Traders Are So Worried About Tether,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/j368zvaqxas11.jpg

It‚Äôs one of the most hotly debated questions in the world of virtual currencies: Is Tether telling the truth when it says that each of its digital coins is backed by one U.S. dollar? The answer could have big ramifications, given that Tether‚Äôs coin (also called Tether or USDT) is among the most actively traded cryptocurrencies -- treated by many as a substitute for the greenback on crypto markets around the world.

Over the past few days, USDT has broken out of...

[Traders are increasingly questioning their faith in the cryptocurrency world‚Äôs most important dollar peg.](https://i.redd.it/ilocwwsczas11.jpg)

Tether, the digital coin used as a substitute for the U.S. currency on crypto markets around the world, has broken its historically tight link with the greenback. It recently¬†[traded](https://trade.kraken.com/markets/kraken/usdt/usd/1h)¬†for about 95 cents on U.S.-based exchange Kraken, while transactions on Binance, one of the world‚Äôs most active Tether venues, implied a price of about 96 cents, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

That‚Äôs a tiny move relative to other cryptocurrencies and not unprecedented for Tether, but it‚Äôs...

![img](qitb75km3bs11)

USDT is a USD-backed stablecoin, issued by Tether. It currently has the largest volume and is the most widely used token among its kind. However, Tether is a centralized business entity and lacks sucient transparency. The price support of USDT fundamentally comes from its full dollar reserve, which has NOT been convincingly proven for a very long time.

Real BTC price is wrong on many sites now.,"It happens because part of them use USDT as USD. But now we can see that it's wrong.

For example:
BTC price on CMC - $6636
BTC price on Bitgur - $6424.
BTC price on Bitmex (doesn't use USDT) - 6425.
BTC price on Coinbase (doesn't use USDT) - $6428.
BTC price on Binance (via usdt) - $6910.
Real BTC price on Binance calculated by Bitgur - $6295.

r/Bitcoin recap - September 2018 - V2,"Hi Bitcoiners!


This is a reworked repost of the [21st monthly Bitcoin news recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kezwc/rbitcoin_recap_september_2018/). I'm testing out a new format where I list items by topic instead of date so they are easier to digest for the reader. I would love to hear your feedback! (on the categories, the new format vs. the old,...)


For those unfamiliar with these recaps, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in Bitcoin over the past month.

How it all started (Finding Partners) - RevenYOU #4,"Finding Partners 

&amp;#x200B;

And then it is time to collaborate with others. Other expertise is needed and extra input. Think of a financial institution to be able to make payments, what does the legislation say about dealing in cryptos, how are we going to present RevenYOU to the world, how are things going to look like, you name it. Many conversations follow and just as many conversations ultimately yield nothing. The chaff separates from the wheat. Parties that want to go for fast money, companies that do not want anything to do with cryptos or companies that promise the world but ultimately do not deliver anything. What a lesson in entrepreneurship is that process. We are now very happy with a solid core of partners who are with us and are indispensable for the continued existence of RevenYOU.

Liquid question - Do exchanges even transfer BTC between each other at all?,"It's supposed to be the main use case.

Of course I know that the transfers to and from and between exchanges make up the majority of on chain transactions. But they are transfers done by USERS. The exchange sending the coins to a user's address on another one has no idea where that destination address is, could be anywhere.

I'm trying to find a reason why one exchange would transfer a large amount of BTC to another, if not on behalf of it's users. 

Lending, like banks do? But that would mean some exchanges wouldn't keep full reserve...

Or is the implementation of Liquid by exchanges also going to mean they will communicate between each other all their deposit addresses? Or, alternatively would they give the users an option to do a ""Liquid"" withdrawal/deposit at the benefit of lower cost and instant speed?

I think the community would benefit from knowing the advantages of this biggest use case of Liquid, because there's much confusion now (I'm among the confused too).",1539605622,15/10/2018 12:13:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9oc4jj/liquid_question_do_exchanges_even_transfer_btc/,1

‚ÄúPossibility of Arbitrage

"If bitcoin mooned and you became very rich, how would you give your life meaning?","Imagine you held bitcoin and bitcoin started to go to $10 million following the halvening in 2020 and a subsequent bitcoin ETF approval into 2021. You now have more than enough money to never work again.

I have seen many wealthy people who eg have inherited large sums of money or had huge gains in crypto, and their lives are what most people would describe as chaotic and without purpose probably because they have so much money they search for what will make them happy, and this is a never-ending search because rarely are humans content with anything. As such, there is an existential crisis that is reached and this can lead to depression or addictions. 

It seems as if those who are wealthy who have purpose and seem to have their lives in order are actually wealth but not free. That is, they have found some way to enslave themselves eg by taking on a huge mortgage they are forced to work to pay or they have multiple children thereby forcing themselves to work to provide for the children.

Thus it seems as if freedom is just not meant for humanity. Freedom leads to a philosophical void that risks nihilism, and to fill that void or to resolve that cognitive dissonance humans must enslave themselves gain, find purpose in some sort of self-inflicted slavery whether it be family, financial obligation, or religion.

Why Tether and Bitfinex conspiracy theories have no logic,"Facts:

1  - The Company Bitfinex and Tether are unrelated companies. It does not  matter if they share one or more owners in common. Tether is the sole  responsible for USDT, legally Bitfinex has nothing to do with it.

2 - Bitfinex does not hold any USDT.

3 - Tether simply sells non redeemable USDT and does not hold any either.

4 - USDT is simply one more crypto traded in the markets, like ETH, Bitcoin, XRP and so on. It is nothing more than that.

5  - Tether can't ever be insolvent because they do not have to redeem  Tethers. No returns accepted. They simply back it with USD to keep the  the ratio of 1:1 for USD/USDT in the parallel markets.

6  - If USDT loses value for any reason, including reasons spread by  conspiracy theorists the only insolvent parties are altcoin traders that  hold USDT.

7 - Whatever you think of it all, i will repeat, Bitfinex is unrelated to Tether, unaffected and fully solvent.

8 - Bitfinex does not even have USDT trading pairs, their market is USD and other fiat currencies only.

Personal opinion:

People  paying high prices for Bitcoin at Bitfinex are  being fooled by  manipulators that spread rumors in forums and take  manipulative trade  actions to fit the narrative, so that they cash out  with a premium.  Nobody will ever send fiat to Bitfinex to buy crypto until the premium  is gone.",1539615120,15/10/2018 14:52:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9odcsz/why_tether_and_bitfinex_conspiracy_theories_have/,1

Here's how decentralised second layer implementations should work on top of Bitcoin Core,"



I am very excited for the growing usage of the Lightning Network and I certainly believe that it could make great changes toward how bitcoin is used; however, I do believe that there are better ways to implement a second layer. 



The Lightning Network uses exclusive channels, but second layers should operate with one continuous channel. This may be hard to grasp, but hear me out. 


Alice wants to send one singular bitcoin to Bob. Using SegWit, it would take about 20 minutes with a fee of 95 satoshis per byte to confirm said transaction. Obviously we know that sort of thing would never persist as a usable currency for a ""rapid economy"" as fast as fiat is today. 



However, using an ideal second layer that is decentralised, these transactions can be transferred in a matter of seconds, especially if those running the second layer assume the burden of time and combine the fees. 



If transactions are combined together and ran in a block-series format on a second layer, then the burden of time is shifted away from the user and the fees would be lowered. Additionally, a second layer of fees would be needed to exchange for those running the second layer. 



Send multiple transactions to the network and then to the blockchain 



Have server clients run a full node from Bitcoin Core and broadcast their presence to the network. Have an open-source protocol be added to their broadcast to prevent spam attacks and DDos. 



Use a bitmixer open source to regulate how the server clients send the transactions to Bob. Use such a bitmixer to transfer funds to a decentralised middleman whose private key is encrypted. Server clients, who are decentralised, broadcast their diagnostics to the network as well, which would be correlated with the transactions. Clients who fail to broadcast their diagnostics in a consistent manner would be auto-booted by the network. The script protocol to connect the network includes a function to boot inconsistent clients. Alice can now transact with Bob without sending a private key. In a way, these clients who run the info on their own servers act as ""miners"" in a way. 



Group all of the proposed transactions, including the Alice-Bob one, in a public series organised similarly like a blockchain. Have the script protocol (which the clients run) verify the consistency and use BitRef or blockchain.info to create another series block of ""receipts"", this is to not only double but triple verify the transactions. 



For Alice to use said network and thus transact with Bob, her wallet would also need to be transferred to the network along with the proposal to transact, along with the diagnostic property makeup of such transaction. That would then be matched by the clients who run a script protocol to start the process of sending and verifying the funds. Once Alice's and millions of other transaction proposals are grouped and reach an agreed-upon size, they are sent to the Bitcoin blockchain en masse using the ""sendmany"" command in Bitcoin Core. All server clients who participated and whose consistency in diagnostic reporting has been checked would be granted a portion of the lower, combined fees by running another script protocol grouping those funds. 



The double-run script protocol of processing the fees and sending the transactions to the blockchain would be run simultaneously in a block-like fashion, and multiple blocks could be run at once. 



In this manner, millions could combine their fees together (if the MB isn't too big to run all st once, the clients can break it up) and transact in a matter of a few minutes with super low fees. 



Also, this would ideally be run on a P2P network or on I2P with multiple VPN layer configurations.

Bitcoin Technicals Are Breaking Bad After Sideways Trade,"Bitcoin bulls might be in for some bad news: technical indicators  show the cryptocurrency could be entering a new downward trend.

The  world‚Äôs biggest digital token entered a new negative divergence pattern  Thursday, according to the Directional Movement Index, a technical  momentum indicator. The index‚Äôs ADX line, which determines the strength  of the trend, appears to have bottomed and has started to curl upwards.  This could indicate that the negative trend is gathering momentum and  that it could have more room to run.

All  eyes remain on Bitcoin‚Äôs $6,000 support level, which the digital token  has not tested since mid-August. The cryptocurrency has been trading  sideways in a slightly positive divergence for the past three weeks,  with the price hovering between $6,300 and $6,600. The price dropped  nearly 5 percent Thursday, extending its losing streak to a third day.

Tethering ain't easy yo," 

Ok so let me explain what's going on with Tether imo. It's not that complicated. Major movements lately have all been due to the Tether implosion...

1. When did the Tether implosion start? It started when USDC was introduced by the goldman sachs proxy, circle/poloniex.
2. Why did it start? Simply because there was a massive exodus from USDT to USDC which also curiously happened as  
Bitfinex had banking troubles again. This exodus broke the peg, finex et al could not keep up the peg with their fiat reserves and thus must dig into their Bitcoin/altcoin reserves to maintain the peg. This means that they have to sell BTC for USD and then buy USDT (or simply sell btc for USDT). But selling BTC to maintain the peg is like shooting yourself in the foot before a marathon, the more BTC they sell the more they need to maintain the peg. Eventually they run out of BTC!
3. Here's a chart [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDTUSD/ObnzRwwj-Tether-implosion-with-bitfinex-to-coinbase-premium/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDTUSD/ObnzRwwj-Tether-implosion-with-bitfinex-to-coinbase-premium/) that shows when tether gets dumped for USDC the premium on BFX increases.
4. /Tinfoil new narrative -&gt; Goldman sachs want to be the first ones out with an Ecoin (Evil coin) but they don't want their name on it yet, so they used circle and polo. At the same time they pulled some strings and fucked Bitfinex over to gain market share...",1539620205,15/10/2018 16:16:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9oe3vo/tethering_aint_easy_yo/,1

The last couple have years have seen a drastic change and had a negative impact on the way us Top Traders have been treated. Customer service is lacking, undecided disputes, banned for with no reason given and lost funds to scammers because lack of action taken! 

We are taking this power back. We know the revenue generated for these sites are because of our trading volume and the just seem to ""take the money and run"". We are left dealing with untrained admins to deal with complex trade issues that just copy and paste preset communication content to answer our questions. We are cut off from any real moderator/admins that have the ability to actually get stuff done! Why wait for days or even weeks to get something done just because they say they are to busy to help you and you've been a Top Trader for years. 

We are creating this new trade site with the traders best interests in mind. Better quicker customer support, safety first trade practices and policies, quick efficiency on scamming reports so hopefully we can recover some funds... 

If you are a long time trader on Localbitcoin or Paxful feel free to respond with input or ask for contact info if you would like to be involved in this site venture.

C'mon smart cypherpunks et al, there must be things we can do!

...

I am a beginner/intermediate Crypto/Blkchain enthusiast. 

In my interactions with interested 'no-coiners' ... the hurdle of BASIC fluency regarding the technology is HUUUUGE. This is complex stuff. Most people don't even have a basic understanding of fiat currency or any computing science. 

I find it VERY concerning, alarming and extremely disingenuous/a massive disservice to the ENTIRE project of adoption etc that [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) and @Bitcoin are NOT controlled by developers (or what the custodians of the updates are referred to as - excuse my limited vocab here!). 

(Yes, there is huge irony here, suggesting that a 'centralized' medium of media (twitter, website) should be representative of a distributed/decentralized network).

But this is a HUGE trust factor for getting people on board and using. I've had SO many conversations with people where after a minute of explaining the Fork and Roger ver etc... a glazed look of EVEN MORE mistrust comes over their eyes on top of their already hesitant/uncertain understanding and framework.

What I am saying is that, can anyone more in the know suggest a way to unsurp Ver and the Forked currency from claiming those domains and handles? What can we do?

Hitbtc is a scam? Just a long KYC procedure. My apologies to Hitbtc exchange," I want to apologize to Hitbtc exchange for what I said earlier. That Hitbtc is a scam and all that. Recently I accused hitbtc in fraud and now I see that I was wrong. Now I want to share with you my story. Please do not repeat my mistakes.

A month ago I wanted to exchange my ETH to BCH. I traded for a bit on hitbtc earlier and chose it once again for this exchange operation. I had never faced any problems there before, that‚Äôs why I chose it, even though I didn't operate with big sums there before.

I deposited my ETH coins, exchanged it to BCH and tried to withdraw the whole amount. It was about $5K in dollars. I didn‚Äôt manage to do that!! My withdrawal didn‚Äôt pass for some reason. I checked system health page for BCH and everything was ok. I checked once again but nothing changed and I decided to try again later.

Next day I tried again. I couldn‚Äôt make a withdrawal. Got \*\*\*\*ing angry. From that point I was sure that Hitbtc must be a scam exchange or fraudulent scheme.  In my opinion the worst thing which can happen to you while using cryptocurrency exchange is withdrawal problems. You want you money back right now and they do not \*\*\*\*ing give it to you. I won‚Äôt lie to you, for a moment I went off the rails. The first thing I did was going to Hitbtc forum and to Hitbtc page on Cryptocompare and expressing everything that I thought about them. I called Hitbtc scam in every place where it was possible.

Right after that I contacted hitbtc support team and they said to me that I should pass through their KYC procedure. I didn‚Äôt want to pass through that procedure  because I had already read that it could be a long process. I tried to disagree with them and told that it was not such a big sum of money and that funds were absolutely legal. They answered that I should pass through it without objections. Even though I was angry and didn‚Äôt see a reason to go through that verification process, I had no other —Åhoi—Åe.

They asked me for a set of questions. I provided some screenshots they asked for and also photos of myself and my ID. It all lasted for about 1 week. I was still annoyed but not so angry anymore, cause Hitbtc team answers to my assaults were quick and polite. I even got ashamed for a bit  because of my cruelty towards them.

After I had provided everything they wanted, it took couple of days to unlock my account. So all in all the whole process took 9 or 10 days. After that I withdrew the sum I needed without any problems.  

As I understand, now my account is verified and I can do any operations without any extra proofs. I still feel a bit ashamed about what I was talking about Hitbtc exchange, so if you guys read it, you should know that I am sorry. It‚Äôs not honest to call Hitbtc a scam.  

But as your customer, I‚Äôd like to have more information on KYC procedure. If I had read it before, I wouldn‚Äôt be so confused about that temporary withdrawal issue and I wouldn‚Äôt be so angry  and tough with you guys. So it would be great if you had some kind of youtube channel or something like that describing all these verification details and other stuff. If you had more tutorial information, nobody would call Hitbtc a scam exchange IMHO.",1539629444,15/10/2018 18:50:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ofjot/hitbtc_is_a_scam_just_a_long_kyc_procedure_my/,1

Yesterday was another reassurance that I‚Äôm no longer a FOMO‚Äôer,"I was one of those people that got in just before the big price boom last year, I doubled my money within a week or two and I thought I was a genius trader and that I could do no wrong. I was literally just putting my buy orders at the top of the buy order book, and then selling at the top of the sell order book and making $20-80 every time. 

But I was also that person who thought that my life was about to change so I invested basically all I had at $18k, thinking that it would never end, well you know how the rest of the story goes...

I‚Äôve been making sure that I don‚Äôt FOMO anymore, and I‚Äôve been very slowly getting better at it, I didn‚Äôt realise how hard of a habit that is to break. But yesterday made me feel reassured in myself that that‚Äôs no longer me. I had some buy orders go through around 6100-6200, I said to myself I‚Äôd wait till it hit 6600 and then I‚Äôd wait till it came back down to 6100-6200 to buy again. Well I sold at 6600, and the price kept going up and at 6900 I had that little thought in the back of my head ‚Äúmaybe this is the start of the bull run, I don‚Äôt want to miss out if it is‚Äù. I decided ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm going to stick to my plan‚Äù id rather miss out on potential profit than risk losing money on a bad trade by going against my plan. 

It‚Äôs working out good so far, the price is coming back down and had I brought in, I would be in the red, once again... I feel great.",1539630123,15/10/2018 19:02:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ofnky/yesterday_was_another_reassurance_that_im_no/,1

The UnTethering: What happened to Tether and Market today?," This will be a two part post. First will explain the Current Situation of Tether and market while the Second one will explain the Downsides of Tether and its Future Impact on the Crypto Market.  


Impending Tether Collapse Rumors are not new if you have been in the crypto space for a while. But, today was a little different. The crypto market and Bitcoin investors went in for a shock today, as Tether, a self-proclaimed ‚Äústablecoin,‚Äù fell 6% below its U.S. Dollar (USD) peg touching its ATL at $0.86 while shooting its competitor coins above $1.10. A USD-peg stable-coin touching that mark was both funny and disturbing situation.   


These are the few things that escalated the situation further:  
1. **FUD** \- Tether bank insolvency ([https://www.bitcoinforbeginners.io/cryptocurrency-news/usd-tether-noble-bank-insolvency-news/](https://www.bitcoinforbeginners.io/cryptocurrency-news/usd-tether-noble-bank-insolvency-news/)).  
2. **FUD** \- Bitfinex stopping USD deposits and withdrawals. Same goes for Kucoin USDT pair.  
3. **Fake Rumour** \- Binance delisting USDT. ([https://ethereumworldnews.com/reports-of-binance-delisting-tether-usdt-turns-out-to-be-fake-news/](https://ethereumworldnews.com/reports-of-binance-delisting-tether-usdt-turns-out-to-be-fake-news/))  
4. **Bandwagon Effect** \- A Belief that everybody thought all USDT pairs are pumping because everyone wants to get out of USDT. Thus, I should also do the same.  


FUD related to Bitfinex and Kucoin got cleared after Bitfinex released the statement that they will open the deposits in next 24HRS ([http://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1051750465782906880](http://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1051750465782906880)), or in case of Kucoin, already opened ([https://news.kucoin.com/en/usdt-deposits-and-withdrawals-are-now-enabled-2/](https://news.kucoin.com/en/usdt-deposits-and-withdrawals-are-now-enabled-2/)). That Binance delisting FUD was fake though. We even saw someone circulating fake Binance USDT delisting notice. And last but not the least the typical Bandwagon effect we can always see in trading markets.  


Thus, Against the background of Tether fall, BTC and ETH were growing. But there is a significant difference in the rates between USD and USDT. At one point, the price spread between the value of Ethereum on Bitfinex and Coinbase surpassed 10%, which is nearly unheard of in the nascent crypto market. While USDT is one of the most liquid crypto assets in this market, the order books of the BTC/USDT trading pair couldn‚Äôt handle this unprecedented liquidation, resulting in Bitcoin‚Äôs unrelenting move above $7,500 on Tether-enabled exchanges.  


**However, it is unlikely that this irrational price action will be sustained for an extended period of time. All you need to do, is the math behind 'premium' value of USDT supporting exchanges, against ones with real US dollars.**  


**(2/2) The UnTethering: Tether and its Impact on Future Crypto Market Collapse.**   


Now, even though we have cleared the FUD regarding Tether, we don't mean that Tether won't eventually collapse. There is a strong likelihood of that happening. You can count the situation today as a cautionary bell for future Tether implosions. We highly recommend you use other stablecoins as much as possible for stability requirements. The next scandal is brewing as we speak. The only thing we don't know is when. So, Better safe than sorry. Here is a simple explanation for the same.  


***Note: The idea behind this post isn't to create FUD, but to create awareness among the masses.***   


***Q.¬† If tether's value goes to zero, but I have alt coins on binance, how would I lose some of my alt coins?***  
A - The idea is that on first sight Tether doesn't seem like a very big coin. Sure, it's top 8, but there are bigger coins on Binance. However with a lot of coins their market cap on paper is not their ""real"" market cap, it's not a real value invested in those coins, so a $1 billion market cap coin might only have a $5 million of value that was actually invested in it. So if somebody sold $5 million worth of that coin, it would basically drop to zero and have no market cap (some people would obviously buy it up at that point just due to the opportunity but that's a different thing).  


So you have hundreds of coins on Binance, which combined on paper have a market cap of hundreds of billions of dollars, but the real value in them is maybe 5% of that.  


**But with Tether every 1 USDT is actually 1 real dollar of value invested** (obviously this is debatable, but that's the premise of tether). So you have $2.4 BILLION of REAL value against maybe $10 billion of real value with other coins (if we exclude BTC). **So if Tether collapses and goes to zero, Binance suddenly doesn't have the money that it ""technically"" owes its users, because Tether is never supposed to be under $1, it's not treated as a traditional coin where if it goes down it's your fault.** Meaning, If tether is trading at 97.5, it means that people think there is a 2,5% chance they will not be able pay you the $1 when you ask. That‚Äôs the risk you take with your strategy. So, Binance will likely halt all trading and moving of tether, and that will create bunch other problems. There will be massive outrage and there will be thousands of lawsuits.  


**Simply put Binance will suddenly find itself in a position where they owe people $10 billion dollars, but they only hold coins worth $8 billion dollars, so they might be forced (either willingly or by law) to pay up and bail out the tether holders.** But that might be debatable based on whatever the courts would decide at that point. Not to mention Binance (and just about every exchange out there) uses Tether for trading with other exchanges, and that could create a range of other issues.  


Tether claims that every Tether they print is backed by real US Dollar, but although their website claims that they are subject to frequent professional audit, this has never happened. There has been one incomplete audit (and some conflict of interest) back in June. So basically nobody knows if Tether is backed or if they are printing it from thin air.  


**Thus, If tether collapses the entire market will break for YEARS.** It might even be worse than Mt. Gox. Not to mention basically every exchange out there uses Tether and many people that have funds on these exchanges may lose portions of their funds or even all of it, even if they never touched tether. Thus, We need better stable coins, we can't rely upon a really shady currency propping up the market. There's starting to come better alternatives like Gemini, DAI and Paxos but they don't have enough circulation or volume to cater the needs of the crypto market. So, we need to carefully revisit our strategy and deliberate what's good of us in a long run.

Using Bitcoin to Help a Friend Flee from an Abusive Relationship,"A while ago, an old friend of mine contacted me asking for help.  She was at her last straw in a physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive relationship and was desperate to escape.  Her significant other regularly beat her and gaslighted her.  She flew across the world for him and was stuck in another country which was male-dominated -- the police wouldn't help her, the government wouldn't help her, and she was in the middle of the country; she had no where to go.

Her significant other had control of all her social media, bank accounts, and confined her to their house.  He'd beat her regularly to the point that she had difficulty moving.  He was monitoring all her communications and would regularly question her about them.  Needless to say, she was a prisoner.

We had dated a long time ago and parted on good terms.  I broke up with her when she told me about her relationship with this person in another country and how she still had feelings for him.  I told her that she should follow her heart. She did.  I didn't hear much from her after.  I bore no ill-will; we're all human after all.  

When she contacted me in secret, I thought it was a scam at first.  I had known her for many years, but I am a skeptical person.  She didn't know I had access to any means to help her and it seems she was reaching out to anyone for help, desperate for support even if it was just encouraging words.  The thing about abuse is that people become frozen in time, and I could see this was true for her.  As she confided in me and I learned more about her situation over time, I decided that I'd put faith in her even if it was a scam -- I had little to lose and her story was one I couldn't ignore without offering any help.

So I decided to help her.  I had known her for a long time, after all -- even if it was a scam, I'd rather live trusting people who have been a part of my life instead of swirling in a pit of constant doubt.  After telling me some details, I explained to her what Bitcoin was and told her she needed to setup a wallet.  She was scared since her devices were monitored, but I explained how she could secretly setup a Bitcoin wallet and no one would be able to monitor it but her.  Once she illustrated enough competency, she gave me a wallet address and I funded her enough to buy an international plane ticket and get baseline established back in her home country.  I told her that the rest is on her.

With that money, she escaped her situation in secret and was out of the country before her SO could stop her.  She is living a happy life now in the safety of her home country, far away from abuse.

I share this with you because that activity would not have been possible without Bitcoin.  An international transfer was possible within minutes to an anonymous wallet, which was then used to purchase a plane ticket without any indication to a third party that could monitor her financial situation.  She was able to setup a wallet in moments without asking for permission, waiting for approval, providing paperwork, or even having to leave her prison.

P2P money on world-wide, public infrastructure without intermediaries enables economic self-sovereignty.  That is powerful and why I believe not in the current price vs fun-money (fiat), but the technology itself that empowers us to be more human without asking for permission from authority.  That's what it's all about.

Bitcoin is the only real money we have and the only safe-haven asset I personally believe in.  When considering if I feel safer holding my liquid assets in USD or Bitcoin, the answer is clear to me.  With Bitcoin, the world becomes our oyster.  Borders vanish.  Asset forfeiture becomes a challenge instead of a promise.  With knowledge of magic words, wealth is fabricated out of the ether like magic.  We can safely cross borders without anyone knowing our power.  Really, it's far more magical than anything in fairytales.  A real system powered by crypto enabled by group theory tapping into other mathematical dimensions, we use energy to mine these other dimensions and secure our network.  It's incredible.

This story isn't much, but I'm happy I was able to use Bitcoin to change someone's life in a positive way.  I hope to hear some of your stories of how you've also used Bitcoin to also help people in need.

Peace.

Conspiracy Theories are Fictitious Eccentrics - or are the Rothschild‚Äôs IMMO About to Destroy the Dollar?,"The Rothschild dynasty, the total capital of which even in the 21st century has amounted to trillions of dollars, is not ready to weaken its position, even two centuries after the birth of its founder. A few months ago, it became known that the oldest banker dynasty is now developing the IMMO cryptocurrency. Details of which are still kept secret from the general public. It is known that IMMO is a cryptocurrency, which is designed to oust the dollar, and become a global reserve currency with true intrinsic value.

Difference between Liquid and OpenTransactions?,"Hey Justus, long time fan.

I was just wondering, I saw Blockstream's liquid sidechain release and couldn't help but draw parallels with OpenTransactions technology.

I still haven't seen anything about the specifics of minting LBTCs or how the network nodes will mint transactions exactly, but I have already begun to hear criticisms from folks about the setup, such as the ability for members to hold fractional reserves.

IIRC in OT, /u/fellowtraveler solved this supposed problem of the federation members cheating by having tamper-proof balances and voting pools so cheating federations could be caught and be removed from the system.

Does anyone have an overview of the specific mechanics of block minting on Liquid and the associated incentives?  Is it true that federation members could inflate their holdings or do similar shenanegains?  Surely this is something that was thought about during the design by the smart folks at Blockstream.",1539637925,15/10/2018 21:12:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ogw04/difference_between_liquid_and_opentransactions/,1

How can someone steal my BTC in the same block?,"First time poster, so please be kind ;-)

I wanted to test how quickly someone steals bitcoins from addresses with a very weak private key. So I transferred $100 to [1Cw4iTCkanJFZhLAQh3hBzD22QdBMrkPND](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1Cw4iTCkanJFZhLAQh3hBzD22QdBMrkPND). The corresponding private key to this address is  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000023.

But to my surprise the money was gone even quicker than I thought...   My transaction to this address was transmitted on 2018-10-15 at 10:27:03 UTC and was included in block 545852 five minutes later (2018-10-15 at 10:32:14) .

Included in the same block (!) was a transaction that transferred the $100 USD to someone else‚Äôs account. To be honest, I‚Äôm a bit perplexed how fast this went as someone took the money in the same block (!). How is that even possible as the block hasn‚Äôt been broadcast out to the world yet. Are miners doing weird things here?

Either I‚Äôm missing something or some weird things happen here‚Ä¶

P.S. I did another transaction to a BTC account with a ""proper"" random private key and that money is obviously still in there...

Any ideas what might be going on there? ",1539642165,15/10/2018 22:22:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ohioz/how_can_someone_steal_my_btc_in_the_same_block/,1

New sub: /r/BitcoinCore - for open and spirited discussion of Core development.,"Hello! My name is Malcolm Rose, and I run an [educational site about cryptocurrencies](https://rosecrypto.com) and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNTzYOqcIPo) about crypto and the politics associated with it. I've recently come into partial ownership of /r/BitcoinCore (formerly owned by Core devs, I believe). It was being used for news updates, but has been idle/abandoned for two years. I messaged them to try to get their input on the fate of the sub, but didn't receive a response, so I'm taking the sub in a new direction.

While /r/bitcoin seems to be a good place to freely discuss this sort of thing, my experience has been that it's mostly the positive view that gets prominence here. I'm looking to create a sort of middle ground where supporters and detractors of Core can get together and debate the issues with a neutral third party as the host. I realize the BTC/BCH fork was quite awhile ago, but tempers remain hot to this day and many people are interested in Core development, the Core team's response to current issues such as the recent inflation bug, and so on. 

Hopefully it's okay that I'm posting this here. It doesn't seem to be against the rules, and I saw that the talkcrypto guys were able to post their sub here awhile back.

Hurling Rocks at Caimans: A Cowboy's Tale,"In 1991, my mother had the foresight to leave Venezuela for the United States. She sacrificed a medical profession, her family, her friends, and the comforts of her own land and culture. It was before Chavez, before communism, before famine, before societal collapse. She didn‚Äôt know it at the time (perhaps she felt it), but she was saving our lives. Recently, I was asked by her brother, my uncle, to give some words of advice to his youngest son, whom he sent to upstate New York earlier this year to learn English and look for opportunities. He‚Äôs 17 and fascinated by cryptocurrencies, but knows next to nothing about them.  I wrote this letter for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Cousin, 

I  write you in the hopes that you will take away something useful from my own experience. 

There‚Äôs a saying in English that‚Äôs always stayed with me, **‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù** In other words, nothing in life is easy, not money, not love, not anything. Nothing worth your time is ever going to be easy. There‚Äôs no free lunch!  

I first got into trading in 2008. Your dad had heard from a friend that Citigroup stock was going to pop soon and that he should buy it. The US Stock Market can only be traded by U.S. citizens and special types of corporations, so he asked me to act as a proxy for his investment, and I did. I did it because I thought it would be a get-rich quick rich scheme that I could learn to do on my own. At this time I was in graduate school and unsure of what to do with my life. I‚Äôve always been good at school. It‚Äôs easy for me. I had professors telling me I‚Äôd make a great scholar or a great lawyer, but at the time I was teaching middle-school English in a poor neighborhood of Miami. I had a big decision to make. 

Naturally, I decided to get rich quick! I spent 2-3 months reading books on stock trading and executing simulated trades on practice accounts. I learned to work a variety of trading platforms so that I could trade several markets around the world, which I did. I quit my job in the fall of 2008 and took my entire life savings of $20,000 into the market. The broker gave me 3.5 times leverage on my money and I had $70,000 of available trading capital. When your dad made his deposit my account had a trading capacity of over $2,000,000. With that kind of margin, I was able to turn $20,000 into over $160,000 in less than 9 months! I was making over $15,000 a month. As a teacher, at the time, I think I made about $2,700 a month. So, as you can imagine, I thought I was a genius! I was getting rich quick, right? 

Wrong. There‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch. When your dad sold his share of stock being held in my account I was also forced to liquidate my own positions. I had bought call options on the future price of Apple stock, and the way that kind of trading works is that your money is locked until the future event you are betting on occurs. If you liquidate before a certain date there may be a penalty to pay. In my case, it was $35,000. After this, I had the good sense to step away for a moment, to cash out my chips and think about what came next. Also, I didn‚Äôt have a $2,000,000 trading desk anymore, and without the added margin, there was no way I could continue to trade the way I wanted to. I wanted to make medium to long term trades, because one of the first things I learned along the way is that short term trading (day-trading, scalping) is, for the most part, a scam. There are technical reasons for this, but trust me, short-term trading any market, be it cryptos, stocks, or commodities is a bad idea. You will lose money with an almost 100% guarantee. 

I walked away from the stock market in 2009 with $150,000 cash but no market to trade it in. So, I did the next best thing: I bought a nice new car (in cash), took a crazy trip to Europe, and consumed over $25,000 worth of shit I didn‚Äôt need, and when it was all said and done, I went back to teaching. I taught at an even poorer neighborhood this time. I had gang members in my class. There were arrests on a monthly basis. Some of the kids had psychological problems, emotional problems, learning disabilities, and many of them were being abused at home in one way or another. This was a middle school. Twelve year-olds. I did that job and others like it because I believe in morality and in helping people. That‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm writing you this letter, because I want to help you, and I think it's the moral thing to do. And you‚Äôll see what I mean by that when I tell you about cryptocurrencies and the blockchain later on. Anyway, during that year of teaching I discovered a new market to trade. One that would give me 100 to 1 leverage on my money. One where I could manage a $5,000,000 trading desk with only $50,000! That market is called FOREX, and its the global ‚Äúfiat‚Äù currency market. It‚Äôs the opposite of the crypto market, which is the global ‚Äúdigital‚Äù currency market. More on what all that means later, but for now just understand that FOREX is the most liquid and highly traded market in the world. 

After the school-year ended in May of 2011, I took that summer off to research the FOREX market. I read many new books on trading, which were specific to the currency markets. I watched hundreds of hours of video on technical analysis and even more hours of ‚Äúfinancial news,‚Äù which is mostly economic propaganda, but I won‚Äôt digress here. The point is that by late August of 2011, I was once again ready to dive head-first into trading. This time, I thought, it would be even better, because I‚Äôd have even more money to ‚Äúplay‚Äù with! This time, I thought, I‚Äôm going to get rich!

I‚Äôll stop here and tell you that the journey up until this point had not been the smoothest. While trading stocks there were many days when I lost hundreds, thousands, and even tens of thousands of dollars in hours, sometimes in minutes! You may imagine the added level of stress I had to deal with because I was trading with my entire life‚Äôs savings and my wife had just given birth to our son, Sebastian. He was a toddler at the time. I‚Äôll give you a brief example of trading‚Äôs unpredictable nature, and the unpredictability of financial markets in general: I had spent several months preparing for my first live trade. I‚Äôd read many books and  practiced my ass off until I thought I was ready. I had a system, a strategy. I was going to get rich, quick! The first week I traded stocks I lost $10,000 in 3 days. I will never be able to fully articulate what it feels like lose 50% of all the money you‚Äôve ever had in less than 72 hours. All the while knowing that if you fail, it will be your family who suffers the most. 

You might be wondering: ‚ÄúShit, why‚Äôd you do it?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you keep doing it?‚Äù That‚Äôs understandable. After all, my academic  background is in history and political science, not finance and economics, not statistics. Well, cousin, I did it because I‚Äôm a cowboy. A risk-taker. I‚Äôve always been one. I remember being four or five, at our grandfather‚Äôs farm, and lassoing calves in the cattle pen by myself. Men were around, but they let me do it. Although, in retrospect, some of those calves were twice my size and could have easily trampled me, I don‚Äôt ever remember feeling scared---I loved that shit! I remember sneaking out and walking down to the pond, then going up to the water‚Äôs edge to see if I could spot the caiman that lived there. I would even hurl rocks at it sometimes, just to see if it would move! Another time, I found myself alone in the dark with a 15-foot anaconda not more than a yard away, and all I could do was stare at it, not out of fear, but purely out of wonder. Again, in hindsight, probably not the best of ideas, but I‚Äôve never been scared to follow the path laid out by my own curiosity. I am a natural risk-taker. I tell my city-slicker friends that it's because I come from a land of cowboys, where men are born tough and always ready for a challenge. Cowboys are risk-takers by nature, they have to be, the land demands it of them. There‚Äôll be more on risk-taking and the role it plays a little later but for now, let‚Äôs focus on FOREX and what I learned from it. 

Trading FOREX was not easy. The hardest part was that it had to be done between 3:00 am - 11:00 am, because these are peak trading hours in London and New York, where the majority of the market‚Äôs money resides. This means major price moves, the price swings that can be traded, for the most part, happen during this time window. For me, this meant I had to live a type of quasi-vampiric lifestyle, waking up at 8:00 pm and going to sleep at noon, every day. At first, it takes a toll on your social life, and eventually starts to affect you mentally and emotionally. There is a certain degree of isolation that comes with it, too. You are awake when your friends and family are asleep, and asleep when they are awake. It can get lonely. However, my first six months of trading FOREX were OK. I wasn‚Äôt making $15,000 a month anymore, but I was making more than I would have been, had I been teaching. However, I had a deep-rooted feeling of uncertainty. Although I‚Äôd had some initial success in trading stocks, and now currencies, I‚Äôd always felt, at the back of my mind, that I‚Äôd just been lucky, and nothing more. 

This fear materialized itself in June of 2012 when the strategy I‚Äôd been using for some time was no longer profitable. I panicked. I started experimenting with new strategies, which only made matters worse, and lead to even more panic. It is no exaggeration to say that trading is one-third mathematical, and two-thirds psychological. No amount of books, videos, or paid mentorships, which I also consumed, had prepared me for this eventual reality check: I didn‚Äôt know what the fuck I was doing. I had no clue. 

I left FOREX humbled, with barely enough money to buy a decent car, much less trade any time soon. The next two years, 2013-2015, were some of the hardest of my life. Harder even than 1991-1993, which, up to that point, had been the worst couple years I‚Äôd ever experienced. Those were my first years in the United States, and they were full of hardship. A type of hardship I‚Äôd never experienced before, and never have since. Remember the school I mentioned? The one with the gangs and the troubled kids and all the poverty? Well, I attended schools just like that as a kid, too, until I turned 15. I had many more encounters with caimans and anacondas there, except now they had first names, and for some reason, were always more prone to strike! Anyway, those were tough times, but not as tough as the post-FOREX experience.

Failure at FOREX took a mental toll on me. After all, I had gambled everything, my entire future on the bet that I could earn a living as a professional trader. I realized I had failed because of my own intellectual laziness. I always knew I had been lucky, and instead of using the wonderful gift of leisure-time the universe had granted me through that initial success to fill the knowledge gaps I knew would keep me from true and long-lasting success, I let my ego convince me otherwise, and talked myself into making decisions I knew to be extremely dangerous and outside my expertise. I wanted to wrestle the caiman! Cowboy shit. Irrational, youthful folly. Needless to say, I lost 80% of my account, which was also my family‚Äôs savings, in less than four months. 

Now, I had a real problem. How was I going to pay the bills? What was I going to do with my life? I was 30 years old, had a five-year old son, very little real-world work experience and a college degree in history and political science. How was I going to make money? Serious money? Enough money to help my mom retire and give my son all the advantages I never had? Enough to deliver on the promises I had made to my wife during all those years she put up with my crazy hours and wild ideas about getting rich quick?  What was I going to do now? I tell you, cousin, these are the kinds of questions you will find yourself asking if you do not heed my advice. 

I didn‚Äôt want to teach anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything anymore. I was depressed. I had what we call here in the United States, ‚Äúa quarter-life crisis.‚Äù I abused alcohol and drugs to cope with the pain of my failure. I was weak. I was unprepared for the realities of life. I did not yet understand, even at 30 years old, that there is no such thing as a free lunch. I won‚Äôt dwell on the specifics of the hardships I endured during these two years, except to say that I almost lost it all, including my life, but I‚Äôm grateful I didn't.

However, it was also during this period, 2013-2015, that I began to fill gaps in my knowledge about markets, economics, and the nature of money itself. Gaps I knew would need to be filled one way or another, if I was ever going  to trade or invest in anything again. Luckily, towards the end of my FOREX days, I had come to realize there was something wrong with all the information I had been given by the mainstream media, specifically on the topics of economics and finance. I noticed that nothing they ever said about the markets turned out to be accurate, that mainstream financial ‚Äúnews‚Äù could not be trusted for investment purposes. It took tens of thousands of dollars in losses and several years of headaches before I learned that lesson. I‚Äôm glad I finally did.

I decided to use the last bit of money I had left to buy some gold and silver (by this time I had begun to understand the definition of sound money) and to open up a brick and mortar business. I did not want to work for anyone else, only for myself. I wanted to be an entrepreneur. The trouble was that the only business I had enough money for was a mobile car wash. So, a friend and I bought a van, some pressure cleaners, a whole bunch of soap and got to work! We were going to hustle hard, work warehouse and shopping center parking lots, save enough to reinvest into our business and go after the luxury car market. We were going to charge rich people $1000s to detail Ferraris and Lamborghinis, and it was only going to take six months, tops! Great plan, no?  Easy money, right? Well, we washed cars for exactly one day before we realized what a terrible mistake we had made. It turns out car-washing is a backbreaking, low-paying, and degrading business. There‚Äôs no free lunch, remember that.

My friend and I were lucky. We quickly transitioned our business from a mobile car wash to a painting/pressure cleaning company, and had immediate success. In less than two months we were hired as subcontractors by a much larger company and I was more or less making what I had made teaching, but working for myself. After a couple of months, my partner and I were already envisioning the hiring of our first employees. Cool, right? No. About a year after we started the business, my partner, a high-school friend of mine, a guy I‚Äôd known for more than ten years, decided he didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore. That he was too tired of the hardships that come with that kind of work. Tired of making the constant sacrifices required to be successful in business. So, he quit. I lost everything I had invested, because without him, I could not operate the business on my own, and our corporate partner dropped us. I begged him not to quit. I told him that business takes time, that there‚Äôs no free lunch, and that we would be rewarded at some point for our hustle and hard work; that we would be able to hire laborers to do the work in less than 6 months, and that we would then focus on sales, and start to make some real money. He did not care. He had his own demons, and chose to steal from me and end our friendship instead of facing the hardship head-on. By this time, however, I was already used to failure, and although I was still coping with the mental stress of having failed at something I once had thought would be my profession, it still did not stop me from following my curiosity, as I always have. 

It was during these years that I first learned about Bitcoin. About blockchain. About the nature of money, economic history,  and the effects of monetary policy on financial markets. I‚Äôd wake up at 6:00 am every day, paint houses, pressure clean dirty sidewalks and walls, spend over 2 hours commuting back home every night, and then stay up for as long as my body would allow it learning about macroeconomics and the history of markets. I researched the nature of debt and gold a medium of exchange. I read about counter and Austrian economics. I became an anarchist.  And, after almost two years study, I began to discover legitimate sources of financial news and information, intelligent voices that I could trust. I had acquired enough knowledge and experience to discern the truth from the propaganda, and it was during these same years, these terrible times of hardship, that I finally learned a most valuable lesson on money and markets: capital preservation is the key. 

Remember, when I said we‚Äôd come back to risk-taking? Well, the trick is not to take it, but to manage it. The secret is education, knowledge. Knowledge truly is, power. Traders are only as successful as the depth of their own knowledge, because it's the only way to keep in check that inherent, paralyzing fear which ‚Äúplaying‚Äù with money eventually engenders. As a trader, you must have complete confidence in your ‚Äúplaying‚Äù abilities, and this is something only achieved after much study and practice. There‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch, ever. 

I want you to know that Bitcoin, the blockchain, and cryptocurrencies are NOT get-rich-quick schemes. They are NOT Ponzi schemes either. They are cutting-edge financial technology, and an emerging asset class. The blockchain has been compared to the agricultural revolution of the Neolithic age and the invention of writing by ancient Mesopotamians, in terms of its importance and potential impact on human civilization. It is a technology which will eventually affect and reshape almost every single industry in the global economy. In the next two decades, all types of industries will be impacted  and disrupted by this technology--banking, real estate, healthcare, the legal industry, politics, education, venture capital, just to name a few! This technology allows for something called ‚Äúdecentralized store of value.‚Äù Basically, it allows for the creation of an alternative financial system, one where power resides in the hands of the people, instead of corrupt governments and corporations, so that currency crises like the one Venezuela has recently experienced, may one day be eradicated, like polio, or bubonic plague.  

I will tell you that, at 17 years old, you have an amazing opportunity to set yourself up for incredible success in this brand new industry called the blockchain. There are entire professions that will be birthed into existence in the next 5, 10, and 20 years, in the same way the internet has allowed millions of people around the world  to work from home, in their pajamas, doing a million different things--things which were unimaginable to those who knew the world before the internet existed. Of course, it will require a great deal of work and effort on your part, but I assure you, it will be totally worth it!

Today, I am 35 years old.  I run a successful ghostwriting business that I manage from the comfort of my own home. I invest exclusively in Bitcoin and precious metals, and are on my way to retirement by age 40. Well, not really retirement, but the start of a new and much-anticipated phase of my life, one in which I won't have to worry about financial independence anymore.  

To that end, cousin, here is my advice:

1. Forget about getting rich quick. There‚Äôs no free lunch!
2. Learn the English language, it is one of the tools required for success.
3. Work or go to school. Either way, dedicate yourself to learning about this new technology as much as you can, and begin to save, as much as you can, in Bitcoin. 

I reviewed the website you told me about, [www.criptoguerreros.com](http://www.criptoguerreros.com/), and while I respect, and to a certain extent admire what those gentlemen are doing, I can tell you, unequivocally, that taking those courses won‚Äôt turn you into a trader. It won‚Äôt make you rich quick. Far from it.  In fact, there is nothing that these ""warriors"" will teach you, that you could not teach yourself, for free, at [www.babypips.com](http://www.babypips.com/).  

I‚Äôll end it here. Hopefully, you made it to the end and took away a nugget or two. Please feel free to ask me anything you want, about any of it, cousin.

Hurling Rocks at Caimans: A Cowboy's Tale,"In 1991, my mother had the foresight to leave Venezuela for the United States. She sacrificed a medical profession, her family, her friends, and the comforts of her own land and culture. It was before Chavez, before communism, before famine, before societal collapse. She didn‚Äôt know it at the time (perhaps she felt it), but she was saving our lives. Recently, I was asked by her brother, my uncle, to give some words of advice to his youngest son, whom he sent to live in upstate New York earlier this year in the hopes that he might find some opportunity there. He‚Äôs 17 and fascinated by cryptocurrencies, but knows next to nothing about them.  I wrote this letter for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Cousin, 

I  write you in the hopes that you will take away something useful from my own experience. 

There‚Äôs a saying in English that‚Äôs always stayed with me, **‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù** In other words, nothing in life is easy, not money, not love, not anything. Nothing worth your time is ever going to be easy. There‚Äôs no free lunch!  

I first got into trading in 2008. Your dad had heard from a friend that Citigroup stock was going to pop soon and that he should buy it. The US Stock Market can only be traded by U.S. citizens and special types of corporations, so he asked me to act as a proxy for his investment, and I did. I did it because I thought it would be a get-rich quick rich scheme that I could learn to do on my own. At this time I was in graduate school and unsure of what to do with my life. I‚Äôve always been good at school. It‚Äôs easy for me. I had professors telling me I‚Äôd make a great scholar or a great lawyer, but at the time I was teaching middle-school English in a poor neighborhood of Miami. I had a big decision to make.

After all, my academic  background is in history and political science, not finance and economics, not statistics. Well, cousin, I did it because I‚Äôm a cowboy. A risk-taker. I‚Äôve always been one.

You are awake when your friends and family are asleep, and asleep when they are awake. It can get lonely. However, my first six months of trading FOREX were OK. I wasn‚Äôt making $15,000 a month anymore, but I was making more than I would have been, had I been teaching. However, I had a deep-rooted feeling of uncertainty. Although I‚Äôd had some initial success in trading stocks, and now currencies, I‚Äôd always felt, at the back of my mind, that I‚Äôd just been lucky, and nothing more. 

This fear materialized itself in June of 2012 when the strategy I‚Äôd been using for some time was no longer profitable. I panicked. I started experimenting with new strategies, which only made matters worse, and lead to even more panic. It is no exaggeration to say that trading is one-third mathematical, and two-thirds psychological. No amount of books, videos, or paid mentorships, which I also consumed, had prepared me for this eventual reality check: I didn‚Äôt know what the fuck I was doing. I had no clue. 

I left FOREX humbled, with barely enough money to buy a decent car, much less trade any time soon. The next two years, 2013-2015, were some of the hardest of my life. Harder even than 1991-1993, which, up to that point, had been the worst couple years I‚Äôd ever experienced. Those were my first years in the United States, and they were full of hardship. A type of hardship I‚Äôd never experienced before, and never have since. Remember the school I mentioned? The one with the gangs and the troubled kids and all the poverty? Well, I attended schools just like that as a kid, too, until I turned 15. I had many more encounters with caimans and anacondas there, except now they had first names, and for some reason, were always more prone to strike! Anyway, those were tough times, but not as tough as the post-FOREX experience.

Failure at FOREX took a mental toll on me. After all, I had gambled everything, my entire future on the bet that I could earn a living as a professional trader. I realized I had failed because of my own intellectual laziness. I always knew I had been lucky, and instead of using the wonderful gift of leisure-time the universe had granted me through that initial success to fill the knowledge gaps I knew would keep me from true and long-lasting success, I let my ego convince me otherwise, and talked myself into making decisions I knew to be extremely dangerous and outside my expertise. I wanted to wrestle the caiman! Cowboy shit. Irrational, youthful folly. Needless to say, I lost 80% of my account, which was also my family‚Äôs savings, in less than four months. 

Now, I had a real problem. How was I going to pay the bills? What was I going to do with my life? I was 30 years old, had a five-year old son, very little real-world work experience and a college degree in history and political science. How was I going to make money? Serious money? Enough money to help my mom retire and give my son all the advantages I never had? Enough to deliver on the promises I had made to my wife during all those years she put up with my crazy hours and wild ideas about getting rich quick?  What was I going to do now? I tell you, cousin, these are the kinds of questions you will find yourself asking if you do not heed my advice. 

I didn‚Äôt want to teach anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything anymore. I was depressed. I had what we call here in the United States, ‚Äúa quarter-life crisis.‚Äù I abused alcohol and drugs to cope with the pain of my failure. I was weak. I was unprepared for the realities of life. I did not yet understand, even at 30 years old, that there is no such thing as a free lunch. I won‚Äôt dwell on the specifics of the hardships I endured during these two years, except to say that I almost lost it all, including my life, but I‚Äôm grateful I didn't.

However, it was also during this period, 2013-2015, that I began to fill gaps in my knowledge about markets, economics, and the nature of money itself. Gaps I knew would need to be filled one way or another, if I was ever going  to trade or invest in anything again. Luckily, towards the end of my FOREX days, I had come to realize there was something wrong with all the information I had been given by the mainstream media, specifically on the topics of economics and finance. I noticed that nothing they ever said about the markets turned out to be accurate, that mainstream financial ‚Äúnews‚Äù could not be trusted for investment purposes. It took tens of thousands of dollars in losses and several years of headaches before I learned that lesson. I‚Äôm glad I finally did.

I decided to use the last bit of money I had left to buy some gold and silver (by this time I had begun to understand the definition of sound money) and to open up a brick and mortar business. I did not want to work for anyone else, only for myself. I wanted to be an entrepreneur. The trouble was that the only business I had enough money for was a mobile car wash. So, a friend and I bought a van, some pressure cleaners, a whole bunch of soap and got to work! We were going to hustle hard, work warehouse and shopping center parking lots, save enough to reinvest into our business and go after the luxury car market. We were going to charge rich people $1000s to detail Ferraris and Lamborghinis, and it was only going to take six months, tops! Great plan, no?  Easy money, right? Well, we washed cars for exactly one day before we realized what a terrible mistake we had made. It turns out car-washing is a backbreaking, low-paying, and degrading business. There‚Äôs no free lunch, remember that.

My friend and I were lucky. We quickly transitioned our business from a mobile car wash to a painting/pressure cleaning company, and had immediate success. In less than two months we were hired as subcontractors by a much larger company and I was more or less making what I had made teaching, but working for myself. After a couple of months, my partner and I were already envisioning the hiring of our first employees. Cool, right? No. About a year after we started the business, my partner, a high-school friend of mine, a guy I‚Äôd known for more than ten years, decided he didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore. That he was too tired of the hardships that come with that kind of work. Tired of making the constant sacrifices required to be successful in business. So, he quit. I lost everything I had invested, because without him, I could not operate the business on my own, and our corporate partner dropped us. I begged him not to quit. I told him that business takes time, that there‚Äôs no free lunch, and that we would be rewarded at some point for our hustle and hard work; that we would be able to hire laborers to do the work in less than 6 months, and that we would then focus on sales, and start to make some real money. He did not care. He had his own demons, and chose to steal from me and end our friendship instead of facing the hardship head-on. By this time, however, I was already used to failure, and although I was still coping with the mental stress of having failed at something I once had thought would be my profession, it still did not stop me from following my curiosity, as I always have. 

It was during these years that I first learned about Bitcoin. About blockchain. About the nature of money, economic history, the effects of monetary policy on financial markets. I‚Äôd wake up at 6:00 am every day, paint houses, pressure clean dirty sidewalks and walls, spend over 2 hours commuting back home every night, and then stay up for as long as my body would allow learning about macroeconomics and the history of markets. I researched the nature of debt and gold a medium of exchange. I read about counter and Austrian economics. I became a libertarian, later, an anarchist, and, after almost two years study, I began to discover legitimate sources of financial news and information, intelligent voices that I could trust. I had acquired enough knowledge and experience to discern the truth from the propaganda, and it was during these same years, these terrible times of hardship, that I finally learned a most valuable lesson on money and markets: capital preservation is the key. 

Remember, when I said we‚Äôd come back to risk-taking? Well, the trick is not to take it, but to manage it. The secret is education, knowledge. Knowledge truly is, power. Traders are only as successful as the depth of their own knowledge, because it's the only way to keep in check that inherent, paralyzing fear which ‚Äúplaying‚Äù with money eventually engenders. As a trader, you must have complete confidence in your ‚Äúplaying‚Äù abilities, and this is something only achieved through much study and practice. There‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch, ever. 

I want you to know that Bitcoin, the blockchain, and cryptocurrencies are NOT get-rich-quick schemes. They are NOT Ponzi schemes either. They are cutting-edge financial technology, and an emerging asset class. The blockchain has been compared to the agricultural revolution of the Neolithic age and the invention of writing by ancient Mesopotamians, in terms of its importance and potential impact on human civilization. It is a technology which will eventually affect and reshape almost every single industry in the global economy. In the next two decades, all types of industries will be impacted and disrupted by this technology--banking, real estate, healthcare, the legal industry, politics, education, venture capital, just to name a few! This technology allows for something called ‚Äúdecentralized store of value.‚Äù Basically, it allows for the creation of an alternative financial system, one where power resides in the hands of the people, instead of corrupt governments and corporations, so that currency crises like the one Venezuela has recently experienced, may one day be completely eradicated, like polio, or bubonic plague.  

I will tell you that, at 17 years old, you have an amazing opportunity to set yourself up for incredible success in this brand new industry called the blockchain. There are entire professions that will be birthed into existence in the next 5, 10, and 20 years, in the same way the internet made possible millions of people around the world to work from home, wearing their pajamas, doing a million different things--things which were unimaginable to those who knew the world before the advent of the internet. Of course, it will require a great deal of work and effort on your part, but I assure you, it will be totally worth it!

Today, I am 35 years old.  I run a successful ghostwriting business that I manage from the comfort of my own home. I invest exclusively in Bitcoin and precious metals, and hope to retire by the time I‚Äôm 40. Well, not really retire, but start on a much-anticipated new phase of my life, one in which I don‚Äôt have to worry about financial independence anymore.  

To that end, cousin, here is my advice:

1. Forget about getting rich quick. There‚Äôs no free lunch!
2. Learn the English language, it is one of the tools you'll need for success.
3. Work or go to school. Either way, dedicate yourself to learning about this new technology as much as you can, and begin to save, as much as you can, in Bitcoin. 

I reviewed the website you told me about, [www.criptoguerreros.com](http://www.criptoguerreros.com/), and while I respect, and to a certain extent admire what those gentlemen are doing, I can tell you, unequivocally, that taking those courses won‚Äôt turn you into a trader. It won‚Äôt make you rich quick. Far from it.  In fact, there is nothing that these ""warriors"" will  teach you, that you could not teach yourself, for free, at [www.babypips.com](http://www.babypips.com/).  

I‚Äôll end it here. Hopefully, you made it to the end and took away a nugget or two. Please feel free to ask me anything you want about any of it, cousin.

Paper Wallet Hacked - Please Help Troubleshoot,"The other day I checked my paper wallet balance to find the paper wallet was emptied.  I really would like to know how this could have happened.  Please list out any possible scenarios and how to rule them out.

Background:
Operating system- Mac OS     
Paper wallets were likely generated while connected to the internet.  VPN was possibly connected as well.  Only one wallet was compromised while more than one was created at the same time period.  
      
Paper wallets were saved as pdf, stored in an encrypted drive on computer.  Nobody has physical access to my computer, computer was never used in public, no CC TV or shared network, etc  Every square inch of the macbook has been scanned with 10 different virus scanners, nothing has been found.    

I ran the website through lots of online site safe scanners and all came back with zero threats or suspicions.       

Other paper wallets created at the same website and stored in the same folder were not affected.    

The odds seem slim that the hack came from my computer, though I have a forensic security specialist that will sandbox and monitor my computer to fully rule out any malicious processes.      
   

While I know the standard operating procedure is to create wallets offline, I would like to know how a thief would steal these keys.    

I'm hesitant to think it was a bot or malware because why not take the other wallets?  They certainly took the biggest of the three wallet balances from the wallets I created that day though.     

The site owner denies any wrongdoing.  If the site owner is a bad actor and decided to cherry pick my wallet for the taking, where would this site code exist that could be proof of the activity?  I'm not a coder but even if there is a record of this, I'm assuming he can simply edit logs and records to deny wrongdoing.      


If anyone has the expertise to chat about this I'm willing to compensate you for your time.  Please PM me if that is the case.

Nodes or Miners - 51% attack mechanics,"Can someone please help me understand.  I understand that if a miner (or group of miners) accumulated 51% or greater of the hashing power then they can change the entries for some of the blockchain.  But isn't it the thousands of nodes, not the miners, that verify the legitimacy of the new blocks and these nodes would not allow this to happen?  I know I am missing something because it seems 51% is a real risk.  Thus, what is the real benefit of so many people running home nodes other than to verify their own transactions?  

Same question with changing of the code.  If someone rewrote the code to allow (for example) more than 21mn BTC, then do the miners have any influence or power to push this through?  Isn't it just if the majority of the nodes start running the new code?",1539661178,16/10/2018 03:39:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ojyvn/nodes_or_miners_51_attack_mechanics/,1

Use Blockchain as secure timestamp source,"Hi All,

I want to prove a situation is current at a certain time or after it. I want to make a picture or a short movie on this situation with the prove this photo was taken on or after a time.

Then I need something I can derive from a happening in the real word I cannot fake or I cannot predict on forehand.

What I can not predict on forehand is the last valid blockid of the blockchain at a given time. I can only get this information for the actual or past time, not for a future time.

So what I want is: I have a date (current or in the past) and I want to have a short string (say 5 character) derived from the blockchain, belonging to that time in a very easy way. I see a scenario as follows:

I get a derived value of five characters from the latest sure block on the blockchain and I write that on a note. I make a picture with my phone of the situation together with this note, I send this picture, together with the time I used to derive the value to my counterparty. My counterparty derives from that time the same value from the blockchain and checks this with the value written on the note on the picture or movie. When this check validates, my counterparty knows for sure the picture is taken on or after the time I sent together with the picture.

I have two problems:

1. What is the valid blockid at a given time? I think this is a bit complex because of the possible existance of orphean blocks. Maybe I can make a hash of all block id's currently the last one, even if it is not known which one will be the valid one after 10 confirmations.
2. Well I am technicall, I can do this derivation steps by hand, but my counterparty is not that handy. I want to offer my counterparty a very easy way to check the time against the derived value.

My questions are:

1. Is this a possible way of working? Are there any pittfalls?
2. Is there a way I can do this in an easy way?

However, if crypto-asset markets became more significant, market liquidity risks, volatility risks, leverage risks, and technological and operational risks ‚Äúcould possibly lead to financial stability implications,‚Äù claimed the FSB.

"Weku, a new crypto blockchain with potential","Hi, been a while we had a heart to heart talk i know lol, but don't worry i still care about you.

&amp;#x200B;

Today i want to tell you about a  crypto platform i discovered a few days back. It seems we are having more and more of steemit forks now on the net. 

&amp;#x200B;

This one is called WEKU, and it's functions and features are just like steemit so maneuvering and being active on the chain should not be too difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](iz9deyrsdjs11)

&amp;#x200B;

The cool thing about Weku i discovered was the level of community interaction and sustenance for growth. The Weku platform and it's recognises cool original content and rewards it. There are no bots to annoy the living hell out of you, and certainly no buying of votes. You either interact with the community or are left alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

There will be  token sales happening early November so i am really gearing up to level my goals of reaching the top in the platform by buying more tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels good to be noticed lolz, i must confess and the Weku community rock.

&amp;#x200B;

Now Bitcoin has more uses and excuse to buy as people will purchase Bitcoin to trade for Weku when ICO starts.

Mike Novogratz: Institutions Will Get Into Bitcoin in Q1-Q2 2019 Bringing ‚ÄòNew Highs‚Äô,"Investor and cryptocurrency bull Mike Novogratz has fine-tuned his Bitcoin price outlook, repeating to Bloomberg Monday, October 15, that it would not break $10,000 in 2018.

The Galaxy Investment Partners creator, who is known for his optimism about Bitcoin‚Äôs future, had previously called a ‚Äúbottom‚Äù in the market in mid-September.

Now, he thinks more time is required for momentum to build to take prices higher, and the long-anticipated wave of institutional investors piling into the cryptocurrency space will only occur next year.

‚Äú...I think Q1 \[or\] Q2 \[2019\] if the institutions start coming in, we‚Äôll put in new highs,‚Äù he told the network.

[SCAM ALERT] Binance blocks my account and suggests me to contact LLE.,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôve got a binance account that I‚Äôve made this spring (May 18th) for trading via their API using the bot I‚Äôve made. I was trading EOS, ETH, BTC, USDT and TRX using this bot for a couple of months. All the deposits that I made were processed since 22 to 28 May, it was 5 BTC in overall.

I was trading for a while, and everything went pretty fine, until the 4th of September, when I‚Äôve received a message from Binance, which claimed that they‚Äôve detected suspicious login attempts. I‚Äôve contacted them as soon as I‚Äôve noticed the message, and they have required to proceed the verification procedure through their verification system (my account wasn‚Äôt verified before). They‚Äôve asked for the documents to prove that this account really belongs to me. After I completed the verification on my side, there were no reaction from them for sometime, but then another news appeared.

Recently I‚Äôve received a message, which states that my account is now a subject of an ongoing investigation, and I should contact my local law enforcement if I consider this investigation unwarranted.

The most obscure thing is that my last deposit was made in the end of May, and they‚Äôve detected something suspicious only 3,5 months after. The other point that I find quite strange is the amount of funds on my account. It‚Äôs only about $30K, is that the reason for the investigation? I didn‚Äôt thought that AML or any other authorities may be interested in such amounts. Anyways, I do find this action unwarranted, and the ugliest thing is that I don‚Äôt have an access to my funds.

Is there anyone who has successfully passed the same situation? Has anyone contacted their local law enforcement? I have too many doubts, and want to know if there‚Äôs a chance to win the trial.",1539706670,16/10/2018 16:17:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9op4it/scam_alert_binance_blocks_my_account_and_suggests/,1

Why the Fed's Real-time Payment System Will Fail,"Last Wednesday, the day the markets started to slide, there was a US Senate Banking hearing on crypto. If you didn't get a chance to see it I've included a link to the video below. [1]

About precisely 51 minutes in you'll hear Chris Van Hollen begin to discuss what he described as the Fed's desire to implement a ""real-time"" banking system because it could help people living ""paycheck-to-paycheck"". But that's wishful thinking no matter how well FinTech seems to work due to Shadow Banking, the dark underbelly of of the banking world which is so gross it the banking sector has tried to use MSM to change the name. Gross.

Anyway, I'm happy to report I just used crypto instead of a Chase wire transfer to move some of my greenbacks from the US and convert them into some pretty Rupiah cash money here in Bali, Indonesia and the results were surprising.

Here's what I did:

I put a limit order buy on GDAX and scooped up some BCH on a dip, sent it through two mobile burner wallets for less than a penny each, then put a limit sell at 1% above market on Indodax, then paid Rp30.000 (about $2) to withdraw the money straight to an Indonesian Bank.

And here's the result:

I saved a $40 Chase wire fee and about a week of waiting for SWIFT (that name though right?) to clear. I also ended up making about $11 dollars in the process from well-timed trades and had my money in a few hours.

So will FinTech help the Fed reach a real-time payment system so poor people can have more liquid access to their money as Dr. Roubini suggests in the video? I kindly doubt it...unless FinTech starts using Bitcoin.

Do you speak more than one language? Then help spread Bitcoin around the world by translating Bitcoin.org!,"Hello Everyone,

My name is Simon AKA Komodorpudel (I know, my name on Reddit is Komodor123, but that is a different story üòä) and I help manage the translation efforts for Bitcoin.org. **Bitcoin.org** is by no means Bitcoin‚Äôs official website, but it has been **one of the most visited Bitcoin websites for quite some time**. And a few months ago, in August, Bitcoin.org turned ten years old.

When I started to assist with the German translation in 2013, the site was just redesigned, numerous pages were added, additional Bitcoin-software was listed, and the translation system was created. The objective was **providing an independent and transparent source of information**; I was happy to help. Back then, Bitcoin was hovering around a one billion USD market cap and MtGox was still a thing (at least for a few more months üòä).

A lot of things have changed since then. Bitcoin has matured; exchanges have grown out of nowhere and millions of people have entered the space. Bitcoin now offers relief for people in countries such as Venezuela, Big 4 firms provide blockchain services, US presidential candidates accept bitcoin donations, and in general blockchain is the new ‚Äúsolution‚Äù for everything üòä.

But a few things stayed the same. **Bitcoin.org remains a leading source of information about Bitcoin**, currently available in 27 different languages. While the site has had its share of controversies, this does not change the fact that just about everything is still **handled publicly through [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/) and everyone can participate** (unlike some of the other Bitcoin-related websites people may end up on). I personally do not agree with certain opinions of Cobra-Bitcoin, the owner of Bitcoin.org, but Bitcoin.org itself remains very transparent and I can personally vouch for the content on the website.

Over the years, many dedicated volunteers have helped Bitcoin.org by adding content and translating it into their language; **thank you very much!** But like for all of us, life goes on. Many volunteers got a new job and no more time to spare, founded a family, or simply lost interest in Bitcoin and dedicated their time to new projects. Nobody can blame them for that, but this ensures that Bitcoin.org is in **constant need for volunteers that help translating the site**.

Thus, I want to address a new generation of Bitcoin-interested people here on Reddit ‚Äì **please help support Bitcoin and Bitcoin.org!** Help us spread Bitcoin around the world! There is a lot of stuff to translate and we are more than happy to welcome you!

**You can find information on how to get started with translating [here]( https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/blob/master/docs/assisting-with-translations.md#getting-started-with-the-translation-team).**


**Feel free to join or [Telegram Group] (https://t.me/joinchat/Bgh47RC1BZb2YE6u8iznOg) and introduce yourself!**

All work is on a voluntary basis, but thanks to a previous sponsorship from Paxful, people who translated during the summer were contacted so they could be paid some bitcoin for their efforts, and we plan to offer more of these opportunities in the future!

Thank you very much for your time! If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask them here or by writing me on Telegram (Username: ‚Äú@Komodorpudel‚Äù).

Best regards,

Simon

Nobody can blame them for that, but this ensures that Bitcoin.org is in **constant need for volunteers that help translating the site**.

Thus, I want to address a new generation of Bitcoin-interested people here on Reddit ‚Äì **please help support Bitcoin and Bitcoin.org!** Help us spread Bitcoin around the world! There is a lot of stuff to translate and we are more than happy to welcome you!

**You can find information on how to get started with translating here: https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/blob/master/docs/assisting-with-translations.md#getting-started-with-the-translation-team**

**Feel free to join or Telegram Group (Infos can be found in the previous link) and introduce yourself!**

All work is on a voluntary basis, but thanks to a previous sponsorship from Paxful, people who translated during the summer were contacted so they could be paid some bitcoin for their efforts, and we plan to offer more of these opportunities in the future!

Thank you very much for your time! If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask them here or by writing me on Telegram (Username: ‚Äú@Komodorpudel‚Äù).

Best regards,

Simon

How could bitcoins survive further," Like recently the banks banned the bitcoins transactions in India and since there is no money or hand to hand transactions going on now people won't be able to buy and sell bitcoins using the money in their banks . Person to person transactions is something that requires us to paly with a dice of luck.  
What you think Bitcoins can do to survive in this world right now ?   
What can it do to gain favor of the government and banks ?   
Could it be possible that banks see it as an ally contary to a threat ?   
Aren't government already regulating Bitcoins and aren't they already making people pay taxes how much they demand ?  
What you think Should be the next move of Bitcoins.

Massive amount of rumors going around tether right now. [**BTC** **-0.26%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) is not worth 7.7k. SHORT IT   


Why [**Bitcoin** **-0.26%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) must break down to break up. [**Bitcoin** **-0.26%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) needs to create a new pattern   


I've been meaning to to do a long term update for [**BTC** **-0.26%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) for sometime now. This is strictly the message straight out of the book of Richard W. Schabacker (Father of Classical Charting Principles) Right triangles, are robust patterns that usually indicate a continuing trend after a declining trading range runs its course. They can occur regardless of the length or duration of a trend, but a trend must always be present. They are usually accompanied by contracting [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/volume/) that suddenly increases as they break through the resistance or support levels formed by the base of the triangle.

I am for Cities banning mining from the electric grid.,"Hear me out on this one before going all crazy on my statement.   


I started working on bitcoin in 2013, at the time I turned political after they started banning it in New York State. *(You can read the whole story here:* r/https://article78againstNYDFS.com *don't know my work in the space.)*

&amp;#x200B;

The goal of bitcoin is to create a network that doesn't rely on the physical properties of the current world. Banking system (to convert BTC to Fiat or the Electric Grid to mine.   


When I became politically involved I was working to get an ASIC chip powered by a 3W DIY by Solar panel. The idea at the time is that mining should come from renewable energy and that we the bitcoiners would be able to save the world.  


Because of politicians like Chuck Schumer that doesn't get it, they managed to screw it up for everyone. We were supposed to get our electricity from renewable energy.   


We need to go back to that research ! If every community were to forbid mining from the electric grid and force renewable energy, we could protect the network (the difficulty rate would plummet back down to very low) but BitMain would be pissed because it would take a while before they could make money.

I came on right after a bubble and received a lot of information from this sub and am excited about the opportunity to give back to the newbies.

One of the things I felt was very effective in this sub were the mottos we've adopted. Interestingly they came about to protect newcomers from common pitfalls as they became known.

1. ""Read the white paper"" - Protection against losing sight of what is being achieved.
2. ""Don't invest more than you're willing to lose"" - Protections against some of the fervor the market generated.
3. ""Not your keys, not your coins"" - Protection against failing exchanges like Mt.Gox

While the whole ""blockchain not bitcoin"" attack isn't new the various scam coins made a killing off of this in the last run up. My personal belief is that this is primarily due to the fact that the term ""blockchain"" is undefined and I believe it's time we adopt a term to help protect against scams.

What does ""undefined"" mean? It doesn't mean that there is no meaning. Obviously everybody who ever used the term had a meaning in mind. However if you took a survey of 100 people from various backgrounds there would be little to no consistency between them aside from an alias for a ""block"" like ""record"", or ""data"" and another alias for ""chain"" like ""table"" or ""ledger"". As there is no official definition as a software engineer I can see how the term ""blockchain"" could be used to describe everything from the bitcoin block chain to a linked list. 

Surely Satoshi gave a definition? Actually the white paper itself never used the term ""blockchain"" and in fact never even says ""block chain"". It speaks of blocks and chains as very general concepts but never uses them together as a term.

See for yourself: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

So where does the technical definition of ""blockchain"" reside? While we all (hopefully) know that Wikipedia is not a source, it does cite it's articles.

&gt; A blockchain,[1][2][3] originally block chain,[4][5] is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.[1][6] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,[6]

1. ""Blockchains: The great chain of being sure about things"". The Economist. 31 October 2015. Archived from the original on 3 July 2016. Retrieved 18 June 2016. The technology behind bitcoin lets people who do not know or trust each other build a dependable ledger. This has implications far beyond the crypto currency.

Notice all but one of the sources come from articles in *2016* a full seven years after bitcoin was created and the top three are The Economist, Fortune and The New York Times. I think anyone with a background in computer science or digital cryptography would agree that these are not authorities in the computer science, cryptographical or cryptocurrency spaces.

By adding the motto ""The term blockchain is undefined"" to our conversations we accomplish a few things:
1. Creating another distinction between Bitcoin and other (potentially, likely) scam coins.
2. Educating the public that technology which has been around for decades could be described as using a blockchain.
3. Remind everyone that no authority exists who could give a technical definition of what a blockchain is.

I believe there will be another run up with the next halvening and when that happens the shit coins will flow once again. I believe we have an opportunity now to lessen their ability to sucker the general public into wasting their money on pump and dumps.

* Their link to ""Youtube blog post"" show a (very active) ""live transaction"" log, and a 'Remaining Bitcoin' counter. Prompts sending crypto to ""Youtube's"" address and they will return 10x crypto... before time runs out!!!
* Checking the Bitocin address on blockchain shows they've received over 2.1 BTC in under 1 hour. Absolutely zero transactions outbound.

This is a post may cost you a Ferrari!,"Hi,everyone

&amp;#x200B;

2 days ago,I saw a Bitcoin challenge([https://bitcoinchallenge.codes/](https://bitcoinchallenge.codes/))on twitter, I'm happy because I feel like I had a chance to be a millionaire, but when the website shows 310 BTC challenge was solved on 12 oct. I felt so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Q&amp;A on the website, the owner said it's just for fun. And after watch the cracking procedure on youtube it turns out that even if I saw this website at the beginning, I still didn't have a chance to win the challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not clever enough to be a programmer, it seems only the top of them can solve it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, May I ask you guys on this sub for a new challenge like: Travel around the world by motorcycle in 80 days to win 80 BTC.(I can risk my life in it)

&amp;#x200B;

Q&amp;A

**Why you ask for this challenge?**

&amp;#x200B;

Because I'm at the edge of bankrupt(sh\*t happens), at the end of last year, My EX broke up with me and married a rich guy now(it happens),in my country you need a car and a house,then a girl will marry you under most circumstances.My dog ran away from home (He can watch porn with me for hours,he's a good dog),My company arrears of wages for 4 months...So I quit the job went into cryptocurrency hope I can get rich, unfortunately, my money all gone(it happens too)

&amp;#x200B;

And Now I'm in debt which worth 8 BTC(It's a ridiculous number I know).when this month comes end, the bank will take suitable legal actions against me.Actually,I wanna suicide a couple days ago,I'm such a loser,never achived something in my life.Definately I'm not the most miserable person in this world,but I'm a miserable one indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why post this on this sub?**

Because there's a person willing to giveaway 310 BTC just for a puzzle game,I thought maybe I had chance to let some generous guys be my sponsor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ask your parents or friends for help?**

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes a stranger better than a friend,and my parents can't afford my debt,They are just farmers,I didn't let them know,I feel sorry for them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why don't you try crowdfunding on Kickstarter?**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a product such as a magic vibrator can make all girls orgasm,besides,I'm running out of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why don't you just ask for 8 BTC to clean your debt?**

Good Question,If I ask for 8 BTC to clean my debt and someone donates me,there will be more and more people to ask it on this sub,I'm not a beggar.I won't say Im in end-stage cancer to gain sympathy or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask for a challenge,My life worth 80 BTC by now I think.

&amp;#x200B;

**If I donate you,what's your plan?**

&amp;#x200B;

I never go abroad before,I need 3 months to prepare,get a driver license,go to the gym,buy a motorcycle and some gears,and I need about $20000-30000 in my bank account to prove my wealth to get VISAs.Clean my [debt.So](https://debt.So),at the start,I need about 20 BTC.

The most important thing is that I want to get together with my family during the new year,I don't know if I had a chance to stay with them the year after next.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why should I trust you?if you got 20 BTC and disappear**

&amp;#x200B;

Im a loser,not a scammer, do the math,80&gt;20,I will try my best to get 80 BTC,and If I failed or die on the journey,I will return the rest of money by claim it on my testament,and If you do willing to donate me,I will send you my ID files before transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of scammers,I've seen a lot of them,the Vitalik(Elon Musk) ETH giveaway scam,fake phising Myetherwallets(OKEX,Bittrex etc.),sometimes even I'm on the official site I feel like it's a fake,and various scams on telegram and Slack.Honestly,I've been think about to run a scam too,but, it's a slash of conscience to cheat someone like me.So I didn't do it.I prefer ask someone willing to pay this challenge which makes no difference to his financial statements.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I want to prove there's **Love&amp;Trust** in Cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What's in it for me?**

You can set the route and some missions for me,like cross the Sahara desert alone(I might die in it).Stay in Newyork or London at least 1 day,not TAG by someone on this sub(TAG means without being aware of it,someone stick an logo of Reddit on my back and take a picture then upload to this sub)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's something crazy I'm unable to do:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sbhpttm95ps11.gif

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pv2qy92d5ps11.gif

If I failed,you lose less than 20 BTC,if I made it,you lose less than 80 BTC.But it will be fun.

I will broadcast my journey on Instagram or youtube everyday,and paint your BTC adress on my bike(if you allow me to do this),if I win the challenge,I would run a noodle house,Return the profits of 3 years to you,and everyone on this sub who replies my post will be the VIP for 1year,VIP means free,in spite of you won't able to come everyday...

I promise I will try my best to help other people in the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

**If nobody wants to help you,what's you plan?**

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a plan B, in the next few days,I will share some fun stories which happend in my life by post here everyday till Oct.31 to change you guys' minds,after that,It dosen't matter,I had to say this is extremely high possible to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

After all,***life needs miracle!***

&amp;#x200B;

Forgive my poor English,I didn't learn it hard on my college.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't judge me,if no one donate me on this sub ,Judgement day will come to me at Oct.31,No more judgement cuz I'm the guy bear the consequences

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to \~\~get my life back\~\~ start a new life if I'm lucky

&amp;#x200B;

If you have interest to donate me,contact: [Email:yodoshine1988@outlook.com](mailto:Email:yodoshine1988@outlook.com)

&amp;#x200B;

We can discuss the details of challenge.

What Makes Bitcoin So Special?,"Bitcoin, an invention by the anonymous cypherpunk Satoshi Nakamoto is the worlds first successful cryptocurrency. Prior to Bitcoin it wasn‚Äôt possible to pay anyone on the internet without having intermediaries or middle men involved. Shortly after its introduction many variants of it arrived on the scene called altcoins, with promises of faster confirmations, better scaling, better privacy features, and with more robust smart contract support. However Bitcoin holds far more value than any of the newcomers. Where does this value come from, and why do so many consider Bitcoin far superior?

In modern-day times its natural to think that if something is brand new, just wait and a better, faster, cheaper version will be out soon enough. This is certainly a contributing factor to the allure of altcoins. However Bitcoin has developed in a way that may be impossible for it to be replaced. It seems that the really important properties don‚Äôt come along when its copied.",1539762482,17/10/2018 07:48:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9owkjq/what_makes_bitcoin_so_special/,1

I hate scammers,"So today I woke up, with the news that YouTube was down overnight. I saw a tweet from YouTube, and some people complaining about it below. Then Google (so it seemed) answered that tweet saying sorry for the downtime and here's some cool stuff we're working on. The link went to a Bitcoin technology of some sorts. If you would send x BTC you would get a little higher amount back. Obviously stupid of me to fall for it. I was on my phone so I couldn't see the domain. There was a nice bar that was running down that showed how much there was left. There was a disqus chat that showed people thanking Google for earning money. There were recent transactions that showed who used this.

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought (half sleeping still), lets do it. I had a small (50 bucks) portfolio that I once started with some bucks I had left. So I tried that, and when the site kept saying ""waiting for transaction"" I woke up and was like ""fuck"". So now I'm like ""how can I be that stupid?"". I didn't use all of my BTC, so I wanted to withdraw that I have left and just quit the whole BTC game since my portfolio didn't really grow the last few months anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

But now my funds are too low to even withdraw... goddamnit. Now I have a few bucks left, but can't withdraw because I don't exceed the threshold. I feel so stupid right now. I'm tempted to buy some new BTC so I exceed the threshold and can withdraw, but not sure. What should I do?

TLDR: there's no such thing as free crypto obviously, and don't fall for it. Don't be a fool like me.",1539763652,17/10/2018 08:07:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9owo71/i_hate_scammers/,1

"Lending Bitcoin, how is this even possible!?","Hi everyone,

I have been wondering how people can lend Bitcoin to one another. Of course I understand you can send (a fraction of) Bitcoin to someone else. But, if I would lend out my Bitcoin to someone I would want to receive interest. 

But isn't the interest part a bit of a problem with Bitcoin? The borrower would have to pay back the amount lend plus interest, while Bitcoin becomes more sacre over the years. Think about a mortgage lend in Bitcoin for example.

Wouldn't this cause problems or am I missing something?",1539767305,17/10/2018 09:08:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9owza6/lending_bitcoin_how_is_this_even_possible/,1

Large sum of crypto currency stolen by someone on the same exchange as me,"# The Situation
I am a software engineer, but sometimes a very stupid one. I made a mistake and accidentally committed my API key and Secret key to a public repository, where I was developing a trading app, free for the general public. This key is used to make trades and view account balances on a crypto-currency exchange (no password required).

&amp;nbsp;

After committing it, I realized my mistake and logged onto my my crypto-exchange account, to amend the mistake. I deleted the keys, or so I thought and logged off and that's that. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to me, a thief developed a script, which would transfer my funds from my account, to his account, by executing rapid fire transactions within the spread of the chosen crypto-currency. 

______________________________________________________

#The Thieves Technique

Sounds complicated? It's not. Here's how it works; The attacker will write a script which sends buy and sell commands to the cyrpto exchange API. First he gets my account to sell at the price just below the current lowest sell price of a crypto, then he will get his account to buy at the same price. The transaction is completed. Now he gets his account to sell at the price just above the current buy price, and gets my account to buy at the same price. Again the transaction is completed and the thief is now a little richer, while I'm a little poorer. 

&amp;nbsp;

For example, if BTC was selling for $501 and the lowest buy order was $500, the thief would get my account to sell at $500.01, then he would buy at this value. Then he would sell at the higher price of $500.99 and get my account to buy at this price. Each transaction in this example would transfer 98c across. 

&amp;nbsp;

Of course Bitcoin is not the best crypto to use in this attack, rather cryptos with larger spread were used instead. This way the amount transferred was maximize for each iteration of the 4-step sequence. I call this technique the *Crypto Spread Attack*.

&amp;nbsp;

The follow chart shows 4 transactions, out of over a thousand transactions that occurred.

Transaction #| User   | Exchange   |    Type   | Quantity |   Limit   |
|:-----------|:-------|:----------:|----------:|---------:|----------:|
|1           | Me     |   BTC-NXC  | LIMIT_SELL| 4900     | 0.00000279|    
|2           | Thief  |   BTC-NXC  | LIMIT_BUY | 4900     | 0.00000279|    
|3           | Thief  |   BTC-NXC  | LIMIT_SELL| 4900     | 0.00000287|    
|4           | Me     |   BTC-NXC  | LIMIT_BUY | 4900     | 0.00000287|    


&amp;nbsp;

______________________________________________________

#The Aftermath
Now the technique used is not super important, but what is is his transactions are completely trackable and the exchange will know with 100% certainty who performed the attack. Every user on the exchange is verified, in other words they have had to submit many copies of different forms of ID. So he has stolen this money in full daylight. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have contacted the Exchange and the Repository host, for information about the thief. My repository wasn't very popular, so it was only visited a few times within the vulnerability period. The Repository host should be able to tell who looked at what files and when (by IP). Also they may even be able to tell which user account looked at these files - if the thief was logged in at the time.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I am waiting for the information from the two parties, but I thought I would let you guys know, just in case I have missed something. Is there anything else I can do here? Should I try to contact the thief, by leaving him a note on my repository? Should I try to track the transactions in the block chain?

Please if someone has any information that might be of use, please share.

&amp;nbsp;

#Note to the Thief

If you are the thief, please know you are in trouble and will not get away with this crime. I will pursue this until I find you and I will make sure justice is served. What you did was wrong and I hope you feel even a fraction of how broken I feel. I am not even rich, you have stolen half of my entire life's savings. Many years worth of savings that I have been investing for the future. Now my future is unknown.

**You can make this right**.

 Please do the right thing.

Puerto Rico Act 22 and Bitcoin,"I'm a full time bitcoiner and I'm really considering the move down. In case you didn't know, Act 22 allows US citizens to avoid paying any capital gains tax to the IRS or the Puerto Rican tax authorities. You just have to sign up with the Puerto Rican government and move down.

However, there's a particular loophole that some people claim exists that I'm unsure about. [This person](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8e7g4i/any_us_citizens_here_moving_to_puerto_rico_to/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=act2022&amp;utm_content=t3_9k4mt4) says that if you hodl bitcoin and sell it when you arrive in Puerto Rico, you owe zero to the IRS. Even you bought bitcoin for $500 years ago, hedl it for years and then sold the day you landed in PR, you pay the IRS and the PR government nothing. He says that it differs from stocks and whatnot in how it's taxed because it's ""personal property."" 

Does anyone know if there's any truth to this? [I've asked on the Act 22 subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/act2022/comments/9k4mt4/bitcoin_prior_appreciation_loophole/), on Act 22 Facebook pages, and I keep getting different answers.

"What Is a Good (Safe, Cheap) Way to Buy Altcoins With Bitcoin in Europe?","Hello /r/bitcoin,  

   

it took me a while to get into crypto since I felt funny sending exchanges like kraken copies of my ID (which was the only way apart from meeting traders in person to get BTC in my home country in central Europe). I recently found a way to get Fiat to BTC and I am now looking to diversify my portfolio and invest some money in various altcoins. I found that kraken does not have the ID-restriction when trading from BTC to altcoins, but I thought I ask the hivemind (i.e. you) first if there is a more convenient (cheaper, secure, etc.) exchange for these transactions. I am looking for an exchange offering a wide array of altcoins so I can diversify.

"When you give, you never know what good can come from that.","Today I met a guy who needed fuel and I helped him out. Normally I wouldn't say anything but this guy was special. He is part of a group called The People's Project who went to Standing Rock Indian Tribe in North and South Dakota. He witnessed that standoff situation recently in the media regarding the Native Americans protests against the pipeline and US Government incident. He was emotional about what he witnessed happen to those Indian tribes and the turn of events in the end. Well he didn't know much about Bitcoin so I was telling him how Bitcoin and Blockchain runs hand in hand with what his project is doing. Bitcoin can help by being the currency which facilitates sending and receiving donations, and blockchain companies like Propy can help facilitate the legalities they face with regard to proving they own that land. Bitcoin can free people in so many different sectors. These projects like The People's Project. 

https://www.facebook.com/helpingpeoplehelp/ 

have little choice but to live meagerly because of funds, but they have big hearts, they're very smart and have been helping to promote equal rights for native Americans for the past 5 years even though they barely can eat sometimes. If they use Bitcoin as currency I can see this being a way to fund more of what they're aiming for and if they can get property deeds of the Native Americans onto the Blockchain it will prove the ownership of that land and no one will ever be able to take it from them in the future, unless they do so by just and legal ways. 

In the end I told him how to get Bitcoin and where to learn more about it. I video tape some of our discussion it's like almost half hour long. Once I edit it and all I'll share it. It had me shaking. He really seen a lot and kicked off another fire in me to help out these people as well. All people, no matter who they are deserves equality, justice and fair treatment no matter who they are, nation religion, race or creed. But, when we see someone treated unfairly, we could step in and help. Maybe something big will come back your way just for helping.

"BitMex Research: ""Competing with Bitcoin Core"" or Does Bitcoin Core really control bitcoin? TL;DR No","Another great article from BitMex Research: https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-cores-competition/


&amp;nbsp;

**Abstract:** We examine the power and dynamics of the ‚ÄúBitcoin Core‚Äù software project and we draw distinctions between the various different ways one can compete with the project. ***We address the misconception that the Bitcoin Core software repository has the unique capability to change or prevent changes to Bitcoin‚Äôs consensus rules.*** We also discuss some common misconceptions and explain that if the Bitcoin Core repository becomes hijacked by nefarious actors or deleted, Bitcoin should be largely unaffected.


&amp;nbsp;

Some snippets from the article:

&gt; During the blocksize war, many characterised the debate as being Bitcoin Core vs miners or large businesses, with the Bitcoin Core side opposing hardforks and blocksize limit increases. In our view the characterisation was mostly incorrect. However, many who made this characterisation then subsequently concluded that Bitcoin Core won, since there was no hardfork. This same group therefore currently overestimate the power of Bitcoin Core, in our view.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Actually, in the summer of 2017, in some ways, a client competing with Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin UASF, overthrew Bitcoin Core and deliberately changed the networks consensus rules. Therefore, concluding that Bitcoin Core is all powerful, is the wrong lesson to learn from the blocksize war.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Following the resolution of the blocksize war, there is too much emphasis on the power of the Bitcoin Core software repository. Common questions now are ‚ÄúWho controls the repository?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat if they delete the Bitcoin Core GitHub?‚Äù. ***In our view, these questions may illustrate one is missing the point of Bitcoin.***

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;***The truth is, as hard as it is to appreciate, end users are ultimately in charge of Bitcoin.***


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


Don't fall for the bullcrap promoted by conspiracy theorists in dark corners of the Internet. If, as some genuinely but misguidedly think, the ""majority"" of the community wanted big blocks, bitcoin would have big blocks. There is no Core &lt;-- Blockstream &lt;-- AXA &lt;-- Bilderberg control of Bitcoin by the *banksters*.  

You, and only you, decide which consensus rules to run. That's what makes the network as strong as it is. 

&amp;nbsp;

What is the VALOR Platform and who is it for?,"The VALOR Platform is an **online investment platform with focus** on digital assets such as:  

1. Cryptocurrencies and non-security tokens (protocol, utility and payment tokens)    

2. **Asset-backed security tokens** such as equity in young companies, real estate, crypto funds, venture capital, and private equity funds  

All investments on the platform are created in a form of token, a cryptographic object issued on the blockchain, powered by smart contracts.  

All these investments belong in the space of alternative investments. Therefore, the VALOR Platform is positioned as a marketplace for tokenized alternative investments. It is operated by SMART VALOR AG, a Swiss company founded in 2017 in Zug (CH)15.  

**SMART VALOR** operates as Financial Intermediary, being accepted as member of the VQF SRO, an officially recognized self-regulatory organization pursuant to the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act. 

The unique service proposition of the VALOR Platform is an easy, secure and compliant access to alternative investments for investors independent of their wealth or destination. 

For traditional investors it solves the problem of legitimacy and security in the crypto space. Additionally, it gives them access to alternative investments, which are not available for them today. This USD7 trillion industry  is today accessible to only rich and influential people in developed countries. The tokenization of assets is a gamechanger which will democratize access to wealth, independent of net-worth and location.

Something I've always wondered but not really addressed,"So there are over 16 million BitCoin's in circulation. Obviously this isn't accounting for lost/dead BitCoin's. So assuming one were to sell 1% of the current BitCoin market supply for, this would be 160,000 BitCoin's. One might value this at over a billion dollars based on 1 BTC at $6,400, but in a ""mass sell"" the person with 160,000 coins wouldn't get anywhere near this amount.

So firstly assuming no government agency flagged over a Billion dollars transferring to GDAX in one spend, and GDAX didn't hold the funds, and someone put a sell order of ""$1"" essentially buying the entire buy order book... This would cause the highest exchange to drop, while all other exchanges are still trading at $6400. A domino effect would happen as just the bots alone on all other exchanges would auto sell due to BitCoin dropping 10,000% or more since CMC/WCI value a coin based on the average price of all exchanges.

My question is where does the overall crypto value go as an entity? CMC currently values all blockchain's at 210 Billion, but all price points are based off Sats. So one person sells 1 Billion of the current 210 Billion, which is 0.005% of total crypto value, but we all know total value could drop below 100 Billion. Where does this value go? Or in the entire market seriously inflated?",1539802725,17/10/2018 18:58:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9p1jk5/something_ive_always_wondered_but_not_really/,1

I'm sure everyone reading this is excited about disrupting fields like **currency**, online identity, and data storage, and countless others, you're also psyched when hearing companies' plans to adopt the technology.

&amp;#x200B;

*But how many of you have fully grasped the blockchain mechanism from a high-level?*

&amp;#x200B;

Learning how the blockchain works helped me put all the news and hype into perspective, and understand the elegance of the technology itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I have interactive examples w/ explanations about:

* Hashing
* Transactions
* Blocks
* Nonce
* Network difficulty
* Proof-of-work
* Timestamping
* Consensus

&amp;#x200B;

I hope to help the conversation so that everyone can understand the fundamentals and we can focus on implementation, the crux of the issue.

This New Technology Will Change Your Life (Really),,1539855369,18/10/2018 09:36:09,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O93Z6VQunU0,1
LEOOY: Let the OTA of the tourism consumer drop the butcher knife,"The introduction of blockchain technology can open up the imagination space for the tourism industry to break the short board and make new developments in the tourism industry. The new technology and new thinking based on the blockchain should focus on improving the experience of tourism services, safeguarding the interests of all parties involved in the tourism process, and finally achieving the integration of ‚Äútourism + blockchain‚Äù. LEOOY took the lead in the field of blockchain, but due to the shortcomings of the underlying technology of blockchain, LEOOY has overcome many difficulties in implementing blockchain tourism.

&amp;#x200B;

At present, there are five major pain points in the OTA model: high commissions, high transaction fees, high operating costs, comment fraud, and bilateral credit issues. Based on these five pain points, LEOOY subverts the OTA model. The introduction of blockchain technology has opened up a different travel mode for the tourism industry to crack the ‚Äúpain point‚Äù, which has opened up new possibilities for the development of tourism.

In the past few years, OTA has accumulated a huge amount of advertising and marketing expenses, using powerful sales and marketing capabilities to accumulate a large number of users and tourism resources. Therefore, in terms of commissions, OTA has a strong voice, and can even ‚Äúkill‚Äù suppliers and routine consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

Through the application of blockchain technology, LEOOY solves the bilateral trust problem to a certain extent. Based on the intelligent contract system, the transaction relationship between consumers and service providers is established, and tourism resources (hotels, scenic spots, travel agencies, etc.) will be established. Putting on the same blockchain will replace OTA's status as a tourism broker. LEOOY decentralized operation mode removes the centralized management platform of third parties, directly connects consumers and service providers through smart contracts, realizes peer-to-peer transactions and real-time settlement, and solves existing transaction settlement problems.

In general, LEOOY has created a travel sharing platform through advanced blockchain, big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Tickets, hotels, small transportation, and destination fragmented local play products are included in the travel chain credit system.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment of rapid technological change, although the application of blockchain is still in its infancy, the value of blockchain technology for tourism is unquestionable, and it is likely to become mainstream in tourism in the next few years. And the greater value of the tourism blockchain is that it forms a transparent, decentralized and non-tamperable global database where every user on the network can upload and retrieve travel data in real time.

&amp;#x200B;

A group of blockchain tourism products represented by LEOOY may subvert the traditional tourism industry. While changing the traditional way of travel, it is also a participant in the industry, whether it is the experiencer or the service party, LEOOY and other blockchains. The tourism platform will bring a significant experience-enhancing effect, and gradually realize the continuous transformation and upgrading of China's cultural tourism and eco-tourism industry, and finally form a win-win ecosystem.

Write your State represenative to complain about laws prohibiting margin lending and margin trading on US exchanges,"By the end of the year, poloniex will stop all margin services for US customers, including US business entities.  The services will remain available for the rest of the world.  Their reasoning for halting US activity is that the move is required to comply with US regulations.  It is rediculous that US law is preventing these servies from being provided in America.  Crypto services should be expanding, not dimenishing.

"I disagree Bitcoin will stay neutral or go down with this stocks and imminent next bear market and correction. Bitcoin was intended as a the correct response to the last crisis, however, wasn't realized then. It will be this time.","I noticed the community insinuating that it will go down with the stock market because people will be trying to pull their money out of markets and look for safe havens in government issued assets and currencies, like the dollar, treasuries and bonds. 

This is flawed logic and counter to the exact solution and correct response that Satoshi originated in the last crisis. 

Bitcoin is a store of non inflationary, non government, digital money and value, that works better than gold, and is extremely powerful because of it's essence. It is a borderless, censorless, immutable, incorruptible, non inflatable measure we can use to evaluate assets distinct from third party interference. It is a power of accurate and true monetary assessment anyone can use. And with community involvement, and cryptographic developments, will become the central means of merchant and consumer exchange.

Stocks, treasuries and all assets were and have been inflated by governments, grossly and incessantly, since the last crisis to stave off the natural discovery of true underlying value within assets. We are now approaching the pinnacle of inflated valuations and indebtedness because of the governments bandaid response to the last crisis. They are simply out of tools now and there is a new measure of value that is immutable, namely, Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the answer.

Bot that generates whalecoins (sells for bitcoins),"**What is this**

This is a way of automating a system that the WhaleCoin developers have implemented to generate whalecoin.

There is an official whalecoin generating bot that most people don't know how to get started as its kind of complicated. There is also a community created bot that is much better and easy to use. It can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/Johan_T/whalebot).

[This](https://imgur.com/a/HNnFgLj) is how my bot looks in the browser currently.

As you can see I have 26 000 whl in total which at the time of writing are worth 0.00000200 bitcoin each, that makes it worth about $335 USD. This is from running the bot little over 2 weeks so I estimate about $150 USD per week ($600 per month if I keep my computer on constantly) using this.

You need 2 whale accounts for this bot to work. This means that you'd have to buy little over 2000 whl and use 1000 whl on each account to convert them in to what they call ""whale"". Know that you need some whl left over on your whale account, I suggest having around 100 whl extra on each account when you are first starting to bot.

**How does this work**

[WhaleCoin](https://whalecoin.org/) works in such ways that an account that is a whale can create what they call a ""post"" and then that whale can also follow that post. When this whale creates a post it gets a passive income of whalecoin for around 3.5 days. This is also when the post can be ""claimed"". Claiming a post gives rewards to its follower which can be yourself and this bot automates this process to quickly create posts on your whale account, makes sure that your whale accounts follows it and also claims it for you 3.5 days later.

As you can see on my screenshot I now have 232 accounts running the bot. This is good because the passive whalecoin accumilation from post creation as I mentioned above. That is a second type of reward apart from claiming that you get per whale account that has created a post so right now I have 232 whale accounts that gather whalecoins quite rapidly. None of the whl that you see in my screenshot are from the post creation reward, it is purely from claiming so I'm sure there are at least 20 000 more whl waiting to be claimed as I have not claimed the reward that gives from posts in a while.

I hope it makes sense and that this helps at least someone out there. All source codes are visible on the link so anybody who can read code can ensure it's not a hack.

Any questions on how to get started, ask me here, I will try to be active in this thread. I am currently running this bot on two computers and my laptop which has 10 whale accounts on it also gets around 10 000 whl each week from posting, following and claiming posts.

If you are interested I suggest you get started because the bot will not work forever. The whalecoin developers might change how their system works making the bot unusable.

Whalecoin can be sold for bitcoin [here](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=Gatua) ([non ref link](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=WHL_BTC)).
Another picture that shows how much WHL I have on cryptopia, waiting to get sold for a better price than 0.00000200 can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/sj69czX).

If you have a really old and slow computer you might feel some performance affected by this bot.

**How to get started from the beginning**

First you'd want to create a whalecoin wallet [here](https://mywhalewallet.com). When you have this wallet you'd want to get 2200 whl which you can buy from [here](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=Gatua) by going to Exchange -&gt; Market -&gt; Search for WHL. After you have sent those 2060 to your whalecoin wallet you would want to create one more whalecoin wallet and send half of what you have so you have 2 wallets with 1100 whl each. Make sure you always save your passwords, private keys and addresses.

Next you would want to convert those wallets to ""whale"" wallets. This will lock 1000 coins (you can unlock them and stop being a whale whenever you want) by going [here](https://network.whalecoin.org/) (if the link does not work, try using another browser, firefox works for me) and clicking V4 in the top -&gt; My whale account -&gt; put your whalecoin address and private key and click ""become whale"" which you 2 minutes later can confirm being a whale by putting the address in ""check whale"" and clicking that button. If you get ""true"" it means your account has locked 1000 coins to become a whale. After that you press V4 at top -&gt; Social Network -&gt; Whale Actions -&gt; put your whale address, your private key and then your whale address again. Do this with all whalecoin wallets that you own and want to convert to whales.

You can now more easily start following the description on the link where you download the bot.",1539883219,18/10/2018 17:20:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9pbarg/bot_that_generates_whalecoins_sells_for_bitcoins/,1

Yes, I know it is exchange, I know  about ""Not your keys..."" etc. But it was small amounts that I was cashing out almost instantly (via local exchanges, neither Coinbase exchange feature nor PayPal aren't supported in Ukraine, where I am from).

&amp;#x200B;

But in few months I had one unspent bitcoin, that  I decided to convert into my first trip to Europe.

Ten days, Poland/France/Belgium/Spain visited, almost whole bitcoin 600 USD worth was spent during the trip.

It was Autumn of 2016, I've never regret my decision to spend it this way.",1539883484,18/10/2018 17:24:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9pbc6i/how_i_spent_one_bitcoin_on_my_first_trip_to_europe/,1

How Prices are Formed - We All Seem to be Confused,"I've been perusing the sub lately, and I see people debating about how the price of Bitcoin is generated. People are getting into arguments saying that scarcity generates the price, and others saying that the inherent value of Bitcoin determines its price.

This is insane and it needs to be cleared up. If you'd like to learn more, beyond what I write here, check out the millions of free hours of lectures, videos, articles, and books available at Mises.org

What I write will be a rather crude representation of very detailed ideas that you can learn more about at Mises.org.

***1) Nothing has inherent value.***

Sorry, inherent value doesn't exist. 

Humans flush shit down the toilet, while flies swim to it for a buffet (to further prove the point, research ""nightsoil""); 

Drawing modern-day hentai-porn takes just about as much effort as the original painting of Mona Lisa, yet one sells for millions while the other is available for free online; 

Up until as late as 150 years ago, one of the most valuable things to our economy today - oil - was seen as a horrific nuisance. Farmers would wake up one day and have black goo ruin their crops and they wouldn't be able to sell their farms because no one wanted it - their lives were ruined. Now, decade-long wars are fought for control over it;

Water is the most important substance on the planet for life, yet giant cities with millions of people are built in deserts and the stuff is handed out for free, and even pumped full of chlorine and used in fountains.

Nothing has inherent value.

***2) All value is subjective.***

All value is in the eye of the beholder.

This is a loaded statement and has a lot of information packed into it, so let's break it down into a few sub-sections

**2.A.) Humans have goals**

Humans have goals - they recognize that their lives could be better in the future than it is now, and they can contemplate a way to achieve that better life.

*2.A.a) This means time exists and it moves forward*

If our lives suck now, and we can imagine - and actually accomplish - a way to make it better, then time must exist.

*2.A.b) This means that ""things now"" are more valuable than ""things later""*

No one wants to have a shitty life at any point of their life. Thus, ending suffering immediately - or pre-emptively avoiding suffering - is preferred to ending suffering later

(Psst: this is why ""loans"" and ""interest rates"" exist)

**2.B) Not everyone's goals are the same**

Many of our goals are the same, but not all of them. Some people desire to become gods of the universe, some just want to make cartoons for a living, and others would rather be non-stop strung out on drugs.

*2.B.b) People can trade! (Provided private property exists)*

If we all have different tastes, then I don't mind giving you a peanut butter sandwich in exchange for a turkey one. Children will begin trading after Trick-Or-Treat because Sally likes Twix, while Jimmy likes Kit-Kats. 

Trading can only happen when the parties involved both agree to do so. It is, per se, always viewed as profitable before the trade happens. ***Barring fraud and horrible accidents, everyone always benefits from voluntary trade by definition.*** This is why socialism ALWAYS fails. Sorry, kids: Socialism IS death.

*2.B.b.a) Trading is difficult*

If you have a chicken, and want pickles, you're a chicken-having-pickle-wanter. You'll need to find someone with pickles who wants chickens, a pickle-having-chicken-wanter. (Thanks to Walter Block for this fun phrase)

This is difficult and really stifles the development of an economy. How many farmers need A.I. technologies for Google Cloud Services? None, that's how many. Thus, A.I. can't be developed because the programmers would starve (or, at least, there would be a strong incentive to NOT be a programmer). 

*2.B.b.a.a) A common medium of exchange facilitates trade*

Money makes trading easier! People have goals, and so do other people, but their goals might not correlate and so countless professions are unsustainable. People eventually see that they can obtain these other professions if they simply create a local medium of exchange (money). Everyone is better off with money.

*2.B.c) People's goals and desires are revealed through action, not speech.*

Liars exist. People might say they want to be the world's best Oncologist, but they spend all their time playing League of Legends. It sucks, but, the person reveals that, indeed, they want to vegetate in front of their computer.

**Bitcoin's Subjective Value comes from the fact that PEOPLE WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING STABLE MONEY OBSERVE THAT (a) money can be used to ease trade, (b) paper monies are completely controlled by sadistic megalomaniacs, (c) precious metals are too heavy and difficult to hide to travel around the globe easily, (d) and Bitcoin is a money that doesn't have these problems. Thus, the goal of having a stable, free, uncontrolled, worldwide money can be accomplished via Bitcoin. THIS is why Bitcoin has VALUE - people GIVE it value via its ability to help them achieve their goals.**

***3) Value alone doesn't generate prices - It takes two to tango***

Prices are generated via a sort of auction system. If I have a tomato, I can go to a market and start yelling that I want to sell a tomato. The people in the market who view the tomato as a means to achieve their goals will then begin bidding on how much to pay for the tomato.

As they bid, the bidders one by one drop out as the price becomes too high for them. 

***4) Many products are fungible***

When you buy 3 turkey sandwiches from the same store in the same order, they're largely the same. Even though the lettuce on each sandwich might have come from different heads of lettuce, the onion slices might have come from different onions, the tomato slices might have come from different tomatoes, the bottle of oil or mayo might have run out half way through the second sandwich and had to be replaced by another bottle, or the person making one sandwich might have been different from the person making the other sandwiches...

...they're still pretty much the same sandwiches. 

They're fungible.

**4.A) We use products for what we think are our most important goals first.**

If you're on a small island alone, and you know you'll be saved in a week, and you have 20 gallons of water, you'll put aside 10 gallons (or so) for drinking, and use the rest for bathing, watering plants, or whatever else.

However, if a storm comes through and destroys 5 of the 10 gallons you set aside for drinking (so now you have 5 for drinking, and 10 for ""other""), you don't have to worry about dehydration. You'll just reassign 5 of the ""other"" water gallons into ""drinking"" gallons. After all, they're all fungible, and 'watering plants' is a less important goal than 'drinking and living'. 

(Thus, disasters are NOT good for the economy)

*4.A.a) The more we have of something, the less each individual thing is worth to us*

If you only really ""need"" 5 pencils for the year, and you ""want"" an emergency 10 pencils just in case... but you have 500 pencils, then you won't even bother to pick up a pencil if you drop it on the floor. Why bother? You'd have to go through 2 every day to actually be worried about running out.

Indeed, after the first 100 pencils, they're largely a nuisance. Thus, pencils #101 through #500 are pretty much worthless to you.

However, your neighbors might need some pencils, so you'd be willing to sell them. Even though the pencils are worthless to you, your neighbors are willing to bid up the price to buy them off you.

***This is why ""Greater Supply leads to Lower Prices"" -- If all 30 people in your neighborhood only need/want 20 pencils each, but you have 50,000,000 of them to sell, people don't need to bid very high to convince you to sell one***. Hell, you might just give them out for free.

--------------------------------------------------------

We've literally just used the phrase ""people have goals and act to achieve them"" to deduce the laws of Supply and Demand.

This is how the price of everything is determined: you have more of something than you feel you need, and you're willing to trade the left-over things for something else; AND someone else wants that thing, and is willing to trade FOR the left-over things with his something else. 

**A price is NOTHING more than ""What someone is willing to give you for whatever it is that you own"". **

* There's no ""advanced market analysis class"" that can predict what the price will be.

* Just because there are only 21 million BTC doesn't mean that each coin will be worth billions of dollars.

* Just because the miner-reward will drop by half does NOT MEAN that the price HAS to increase. 

* Just because Bitcoin achieves a goal that people want doesn't mean that everyone will go bankrupt trying to acquire it.

The amount of Bitcoin is the amount of Bitcoin, and people with goals will assign a value to it, and this value will run into other people's valuation of it, which will eventually, on an open, free market, generate a price of it.

------------------------------------

Again, if you want to learn how REAL economics works, or just get your teeth whet, hop over to Mises.org where you can learn economics in EASY TO UNDERSTAND terms.

If it weren't for Ron Paul waking me up in 2007 and pointing me to Mises.org and Austrian Economics, I wouldn't have ever thought about Bitcoin as anything serious.

And remember kids: Socialism IS death.

A new P2P Bitcoin Trader Platform,"We are a team of top traders On Localbitcoin and Paxful ready to try something new!!

The last couple of years have seen a drastic change and had a negative impact on the way us Top Traders have been treated. Customer service is lacking, undecided disputes, accounts banned for no reason given and lost funds to scammers. No action is being taken!

We are taking this power back. We know the revenue generated for these sites are because of our trading volume and they just seem to ""take the money and run"". We are left dealing with untrained admins to deal with complex trade issues that just copy and paste preset communication content to answer our questions. We are cut off from any real moderator/admins that have the ability to actually get stuff done! Why wait for days or even weeks to get something done just because they say they are to busy to help you and you've been a Top Trader for years?

We are creating this new trade site with the traders best interests in mind. Better and more responsive customer support, safety first trade practices and policies, and quick efficiency on scamming reports so hopefully we can recover some funds...

If you are a long time trader on Localbitcoin or Paxful feel free to respond with input or ask for contact info if you would like to be involved in this site venture.

Thanks

SEC Launches Fintech Hub To Engage With Cryptocurrency Startups And More,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/a8s6ssm021t11.png

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is launching a portal for engaging with companies using blockchain, artificial intelligence and more.

Available today, the new fintech hub, or¬†[FinHub¬†](https://www.sec.gov/finhub-form#no-back)for short, is designed to bring the SEC‚Äôs existing services to a single access point and provide an easier way for companies to communicate with the public.

As startups building with blockchain increasingly come under the SEC‚Äôs attention, the new portal has the potential to streamline the process of building compliant platforms prior to launch.

The SEC‚Äôs FinHub will be led by Valerie A. Szczepanik, senior advisor for digital assets and innovation and associate director in the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing these things for years,‚Äù Szczepanik told¬†*Forbes*. ‚ÄúThis is going to...

I want to set my barber up for accepting crypto,"So my barber has posted flyers all over his business saying that credit cards will no longer be accepted.  I'd like to get him set up for accepting crypto and have been doing a lot of reading.  His main focus is to save the $1000 monthly that credit cards/banks take every month. 

He can easily open a wallet and customers can send him crypto by scanning his QR code. I don't care for Bitpay or Coinbase Commerce because I believe they both covert to fiat currency and take a 1 or 1-1/2% fee.  That defeats the purpose.  With a wallet he can just transfer his crypto to an exchange and sell it for the transaction fee (0.3% or so).  No need for a wallet to do that. 

A POS system running on a tablet would be nice but there are very few on the Apple App Store and they also want a cut. I did see the thread on BTCPay and that looks interesting. Perhaps I can set up a simple website/storefront with his menu items that he could access on a tablet. 

I envision that at the end of each day he'll transfer his crypto to an exchange and sell it for USD.  Or perhaps once per week. Then maybe twice monthly transfer the USD to his bank account. 

Keeping in mind that low cost/fees is the goal:
1. What is the best wallet?
2. What is the best point of sale app if any?
3. What is the best exchange?

If someone developed a POS app for merchants and sold it for a one-time fee it would probably do very well. That's what I'm looking for but there doesn't appear to be any.

Cold Storage vs. Hot Storage,"So, I am new to the world of Bitcoin and been doing tons of research about how to store your bitcoin safely. Majority of people highly recommend cold Storage using a device such as Ledge Nano S, but here's what I don't get. Using the Ledger Nano S is suppose to be a ""Cold Storage"" Offline device to store bitcoin but from the what I've seen on YouTube and numerous of posts is that you have to set it up ONLINE and download the wallet of your liking. Huh? I thought this was a OFFLINE cold storage? Or is it that after you setup everything ONLINE, treat it as an OFFLINE device afterwards? Also, if you're just setting up your Ledge Nano S ONLINE, is it recommend to do so on a Windows Format or Chromebook Format or MAC? Does it have to be brand new, can you use an exsisting PC you own with firewall and anti virus system installed on the computer? Or buy a whole seperate computer, THEN install the Apps ONLINE? After, keep it OFFLINE?

For hot storage I came to the conclusion that usuing Electrum is a EXCELLENT desktop format from all the research I've done. My question is, do you have to have a hot and cold storage set up? It only makes sense to do so?

"About ""Capsule protocol""","# 

# Proof of Allocation

    Our platform design has **native Decentralized exchanges (nDex)** that are implemented default in the protocol. 	By trading the tokens between dApps via nDex, we can express the share of dApps (ie **Dominance of Token**). The Dominance is used as a priority for the decentralized consensus of platform.

**You must declare the token-id before writing contract.** The contract that is related nothing at any token-id is ignored.

# Validation Rights

For validation, the native token \[=qp:Qualified Personnel token\] is used and calculated as follows.

1. Deriving the Dominance of each token **\[Td:Token dominance\]**.
2. Find the Dominance according to the average amount (acquisition difficulty) of qp burned in a certain period **\[Bd:Burned dominance\]**.

Based on the average of Td and Bd, **Validation Rights**  per qp (1) are calculated and nonce of different difficulty are  distributed. The block height grows fast according to the dominance of  qp declared and the dominance of dApps.  This means that the average of past evaluations and current evaluations  should be the basis of consensus.

Vr=Average(Td, Bd) ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ(1)

However, unlike PoS, qp is burned to a pool called **DAM**, not stake.  **So what is the motivation for the validator to burn qp?**

# Motivation

Since qp can not be burned unless it declares with some sort of  dApps, it is necessary to select one of the dApps as investment  destination. At burning, the validator temporarily loses qp, but if  dominance of the declared dApps goes up, **the qp will be paid back according to the rate of increase (=Dincr)**.  If you request a payback when the dominance falls, the funds will be  reduced, but this is the same rule as for regular investment.The most different point from Staking is that there are cases that **not only the opportunity to increase assets but also the risk of decreasing**.  (There are cases in which it becomes a low risk rather than a normal  investment because it is bet on dominance rather than token price.)

# Resource allocation

Resources are allocated according to dominance per dApps.  The resources given by burning qp are determined by the Validation Rights(Vr) declared in relation to dApps.  Since it is averaged with the resource allocation of the previous block, **it does not become completely 0% or 100%**, and fluctuates little by little.  You can not keep the resource right at a high level without continuously burning.

## In addition, there are explanations of various smart algorithms such as Rewards and Attack tolerance. Please check our [white paper](https://capsulefactory.cf/PoA.html) for details.

# Capsule FAQ

## 1.Why do not allocate resources by voting system or stake based validation?

Because the coin itself is not consumed on the stake based system, we  can not reproduce the state of risk &amp; reward. Also, because the rights are fixed in the voting system, Economic  Metabolism does not occur and it is not possible to promote the  development of a sound market.

## 2.Why is risk &amp; reward important?

Selling resources means selling high security. For example startup companies, if they have few assets, and they are not  famous, they can not write a large amount of transaction to the main  chain and can not get high security. Validators with qp are able to give solutions to this problem. Burning qp on exchanges with dApps tokens is synonymous with that qp  validator invests in dApps. If run it on a stake based platform, the power of the validator will be  fixed in a biased state, and a smart and fair business will not be made. This is essentially the same as domination, And multiple similar  platforms will occur. In the end, each security falls.

## 3.Why is the distribution volume of qp fixed?

Once burned and compensated and issued repeatedly, market inflation  easily happens, the value of qp approaches zero. In this state, the act of ""burning the value"" itself becomes impossible,  so qp is finite and it is necessary to adjust the timing of payback as  well.

## 4.Why can not I issue tokens with same functions (allocation of  resources) as qp freely? Why can not bet by directly burning dApps  tokens?

In order to grow dApps they need to be able to design their own  management strategies themselves. However, to generate tokens like qp that can control resources, is  equivalent to ""making qp infinite"". If there is a motive in ""burning the token of dApps"", specializing on it  will be occured as a strategy. (For example, supplement qp with tokens prepared on the other hand.) It is concerned that this will not only impair the stability of the  platform but will also encourage the creation of useless tokens and  contracts. Also, there is a demerit that the meaning of ""burning"" will be weak if  the price of the token is not stable. For example, suppose that a token that can compensate is issued in  exchange for qp in the same way as above. When everyone uses such tokens, as a result, since the total amount of  qp is fixed, so the qp price will be rising steadily. You can not continue to purchase qp unless the price of supplement token  goes up endless, and such things will not happen (there are nobody they  want infinite token and sell a finite qp). By using the qp for burn dedicated token, it is possible for the  platform to have the function that both parties can share the common  concept of ""burning the Value"". And we make it possible to lay the foundation for business. In fact Bitcoin actually gives a process by which essentially infinite  energy (electric power) is replaced with a finite numerical value (BTC).  With this, the user gains the yardstick„ÄÄwhich measures common values. Like that, the Capsule gives the user a yardstick of new value by taking  leadership of a ""burn (bet) token"". Security by the acquisition difficulty level can not be maintained  unless concentration to a certain extent occurs. Therefore, it is thought that it is difficult to occur a situation that  infinite forks can be created, so the platform of similar mechanism does  not occur infinitely.

## 5.Why burn qp tokens and gain network resources? What is the difference between buying tokenized resources directly?

The primary difference is that you can not keep the resource right  permanently. The role of the platform is ""market liberalization"". When resources are tokenized natively to Capsule, the monopolization of  the platform is caused by the buying up of the token, and market  liberalization is hindered. Therefore, by permitting only the rule ""acquire resource by burn of qp  token"", we are designing to be able to freely develop business and  financial products of abundant variations. (For example, insurance for resouces or making rules to encourage  competition.) It can be freely designed by anyone to tokenize resources via burning  qp. By promoting the liberalization of the market, qp tokens are structured  so that qp can not possess dominant power.

## 6.What is the average time or block time for calculating dominance?

It is expensive to burn when the total burn volume (difficulty) is large  of the past several days, but if you burn when the total amount is  small, resources can be obtained at low cost, so the burn volume will go  up and down. This means that the market price of the resource fluctuates. In other words, even though the market price exists in the resource,  there is a situation that the resource can not be monopolized. It may be interesting to compare resources to live things like marine  products. This is a feature never seen in PoS and other consensus algorithms so  far. There is no precedent.  (For example in PoS, since it can keep betting the whole amount, there  is no such thing as temporal difficulty level) Therefore, it is necessary to experiment well to investigate average  time, block time, etc., and we do not declare fixed values ‚Äã‚Äãat the  present time.

## 7.Does qp have value as a currency?

There is a second merit that the rule ""to have a burn token on the  outside of the dominance and use it "" leads to stabilizing the price of  the qp token. If you do not burn  qp to a certain extent the platform will not work so  the burn volume will not go away, but too much will not continue to  rise as it will be expensive. That is, it is expected that the weight of qp, will remain in a certain  level. This is very similar to the mechanism of difficulty (Retargeting), which  is an algorithm common to PoW currencies such as bitcoin. If qp do not have popularity you can get a lot of percentage of Burn  Dominance, and it costs that when it has popularity, so the number of  people will naturally be limited. However, as the cost rises too much, as the number of people decreases  again, it becomes easier to enter the burn competition is repeated. In the case of Bitcoin, the price is not stable because there is a gap  between the mining difficulty level and the price of the BTC, but in the  case of the qp token there is an immediate correlation between the  price of the qp and the burn difficulty. Since BTC requires initial investment, entry is difficult, there is a  time delay to recover the loss. And there is also a gap between the minor and the holder. In Capsule, you can burn qp immediately when difficulty level is low,  and can be quited immediately when it is high. Therefore, it is expected that the transition of the difficulty level  will be the transition of the token price as it is. We can not conclude clearly, but the value from a different perspective  will be anticipated.

## 8.Is there surplus of resource with high dominance tokens?

Yes. It can happen that resources temporarily remain. However, the fact that resources are left means that dApps is running  even if you do not burn for a while, so the benefits of burning are  reduced, and the validator moves away. Because the dApps with big dominance is expected increase rate is lower  and the expectation rate of payback is lower.

## 9.What is the merit of developing a new dApps with Capsule?

The higher the security, the more difficult it is to acquire the  resources needed for contract. For example, when investing in the form that the validator obtains the  dApps token in exchange for the burn of the qp token, it can make a  foundation on which sustainable grows of dApps  even if it can not  collect funds with ICO etc.

Blockchain Practitioners: Go on or Retreat?,"&amp;#x200B;

As the bear market effect becomes even more apparent, articles about blockchain practitioners‚Äô running away from the blockchain industry appear frequently. Moaning sweeps the WeChat Moments, contributing to the increasingly strange climate in this stagnant industry. As far as we (CHAINBS, ID: iqklbs) concern, however, the running away from the industry is only one of the hundreds of states of blockchain practitioners. More practitioners are striving in this industry for different considerations. Like ordinary workers, they go up and down along with the blockchain industry.

Recently, we have interviewed several blockchain practitioners who held different posts, entered the blockchain market at different time and chose to stay in this industry for different reasons. In the competition with blockchain, they performed happy encounters at a new era related to belief, desire and money.

01

Entering the blockchain market

Money and belief are the most powerful motivations.----Dan Brown

‚ÄúWe are preachers but you are more like a professional white-collar worker. These are two totally different states.‚Äù Alan straightforwardly told his colleague, who had taken up the post for one month but remained out of form though working very hard.

As a copartner in a blockchain project, Alan is mainly responsible for project operation. In early 2018, he quit his high-paid job in a listed company and turned to the blockchain industry, bidding farewell to the role of workers and starting his own business. Leading such a life, he had to work late until 4:30 a.m. in Zhongguancun Science Park, four times a week.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs paper. When I really understand it, I realize that it feels like finding out a new engine that leads the global trend,‚Äù said Alan, who praised himself as a lover of freedom and a distributed thinker, recalling his decision to invest all his properties in the blockchain industry.

According to Coindesk, as of early 2018, the funds raised through ICO (Initial Coin Offering) worldwide in recent years had reached about USD 6 billion. In 2018, the funds raised by the blockchain Q1 even amounted to about USD 6.3 billion.

Under the backdrop of lack of underlying platform, imperfect performance, insufficient compatibility and other problems, however, most projects became a tool for financial shuffle (or, getting newcomers‚Äô money), with very few of them being implemented.

This gave a head-on blow at Alan, who had been ready and resolute to make all-out efforts. In his word, it felt like boarding on Mayflower and sailed across an ocean to the American continent. He, ambitious and very confident, decided to build a Disneyland on such a vast land. But it turned out that he couldn‚Äôt even find a toilet the first night he arrived there.

Under that situation, Alan‚Äôs team had to reconsider. Based on the status quo of blockchain, public blockchain became the only choice at that moment. From the perspective of long-term interests, at the same time, underlying technologies determined the superstructure.

However, the public blockchain projects proceeded slowly, which was beyond their expectations. They might stay up for several nights to fix a bug that seemingly could be ignored from the perspective of outsiders, and spend two weeks modifying a code number.

In contrast, the ICO disturbance made the equity investment become marginalized in the blockchain industry. Based on a Coindesk report, the funds raised through VC (venture capital) by the blockchain Q1 were only USD 885 million, accounting for about 13% of ICO funds.

There were mainly three reasons behind it: firstly, the structure of fund LP (limited partner) determined the projects and directions in which to invest; secondly, the blockchain project Token was unable to keep accounts; and thirdly, there were great uncertainties in the supervision on policies.

Nonetheless, new opportunities are always born in challenges. As Internet dividends accelerate to decrease, the industrial pattern becomes even more stable. Many traditional investors perceive a favorable turn from the boom of blockchain market and make a fresh start. Eric, one of the above-mentioned investors, believed that the blockchain was an opportunity for him to make a corner overtaking.

‚ÄúVenture capital became most popular in September 2014 but gradually declined after 2016. Investors who entered the market during that period, to reach the height those investors who entered in 2011 achieved, have to carry out more case study and spend at least threefold time before they can exit the market. I mean ‚ÄòPOSSIBLE‚Äô. A right moment is very important. I will take into consideration the changes of our times when making a choice.‚Äù

In an equity investment institution, Eric tried to invest in the blockchain. Due to the restrictions in the institution, he left there in September 2017 and established his own Token Fund, becoming an activist in the coin community.

Unlike Alan, blockchain‚Äôs greatest impact on Eric was rapid changes. The period from November to December last year was the craziest one, during which one person could invest in 20 to 30 projects in 30 days. These projects could be put on exchanges in one or two weeks and their values would triple or quintuple, without being locked. In addition, it was very easy to exit with high returns.

‚ÄúAt the early stage of entering the¬†market, the values of these projects were increased by 30 times, turning hundreds of thousands into tens of millions. At that moment, many money-making ideas sprang up uncontrollably. It was from then on that I thought I should arrange my ecology.‚Äù

In addition, Eric was deeply touched by the human nature hidden in the blockchain market. He thought that most investors entering this market overestimated it. When the market value rose, they imagined that it would further increase, but at the same time, they were worried about missing the opportunity. When the value declined, they would thumb their nose at it. This was a normal phenomenon of human nature, which, in essence, contributed to the blockchain bubble.

The bubble, of course, is a double-edged sword. Advantageously, it can attract more capitals to accelerate the implementation of projects. Disadvantageously, the whole market will become very complicated if different capitals swarm in, bringing an underlying structural problem in the market. This means that the market needs some time to digest after the bubble vanishes.

02

Bear market

Volatility is greatest at turning points, diminishing as a new trend becomes established. --George Soros

The so-called bear market is, in fact, an underlying structural problem left by the market. In bear market, the blockchain suffers from a temporary shortage of technological development. The fundamental question is: the coin community and blockchain community walk together, like two legs. But the former is too fast and the latter fails to keep pace with it.

In this aspect, Alan had his own interpretation. He believed that the bear market was the logic in the coin community. For the blockchain community, the climate in this winter won‚Äôt stop the advent of next spring. He even thought that the age of bear market would in turn hold people in reverence towards technologies.

He had deep feelings on this when communicating with people around him. In the past, they would, in a scornful manner, tell him that ‚Äúthe bear market is coming‚Äù to expressed ‚Äúconcern‚Äù on him. Today, although with the same scornful manner, they ask ‚Äúwhen will your projects be implemented‚Äù.

Alan regarded this change as a kind of progress: ‚Äúassuming that the cognition degree of the public on coin and blockchain was 9 and 1 respectively in the past, and then the cognition degree on blockchain has reached at least 2.5 so far.‚Äù

When talking about his adherence, Alan thought that it was very boring at the beginning. But at a certain key link, the adherence would arise spontaneously. It felt like hitting a huge swing ball. The ball would remain absolutely still when you hit it with a sledge only once. But it would waggle slightly if you strike it with a small ball constantly lasting 40 minutes. And it would waggle even higher and remain pendulant because of inertia.

Besides creating products, Alan also applied himself to building an ecological alliance. He believed that, compared with the bear market, the wane of the whole society‚Äôs confidence on the blockchain was more terrible.

Externally, he hoped his team became preferentially oriented to build the ecology of consensus, helping more people re-understand the blockchain from the perspective of technologies. Internally, he hoped to concentrate on studying products, and on the basis of ensuring quality, gradually expand their influence so that they can make a takeoff by the time of bull market. By this token, it is not a bad choice to conceal their ability in responding to the bear market.

Felix, who entered the market in this March, also understood the blockchain from the perspective of consensus, which, however, was substantially different from that of Alan. ‚ÄúThe value of blockchain projects lies in consensus, instead of the projects themselves or their underlying technologies. Where does the consensus come from? It comes from others‚Äô recognition,‚Äù said Felix.

Building recognition was one of Felix‚Äôs jobs. He believed that the coin community, like the entertainment industry, adopted the pattern of fan economy. For example, when making a project announcement, it needed to take into consideration hot topics and tones, such as using a serious manner or humorous one. For another example, project leaders needed to come up with the contents of WeChat Moments before sharing them into WeChat Moments upon approval.

Felix also disclosed that the so-called ‚Äúfather of blockchain XX‚Äù, ‚Äúpreacher of blockchain XX‚Äù and other images were all designed. In order to trigger the empathy of technical nerds, they designed an image of science geek who was ineloquent and concentrated on technologies. They even asked project CEO to wear jeans, short-sleeve shirt or T-shirt in interview.

Before entering the blockchain market, Felix, as a lover of words, once served as Web editor and reporter. In order to make big money, he joined a venture capital company. Later on, he found a Web company but lost hundreds of thousands of yuan. Early this year, he came to know the blockchain by chance and made some money, alleviating the anxiety caused by estrangement from his peers. Later, he invested all his properties in the blockchain, focusing on ‚Äúdelivering water‚Äù in the blockchain industry.

He called himself a flow provider in the blockchain industry. The flow referred to: he helped employ staff when exchanges were in labor shortage; he helped establish ecological associations when projects had no one; he helped project leaders maintain relationship with investors when investors safeguarded their legal rights.

For Felix, all money-making ideas were welcome. The simple and direct job requirement also made his goal even more undisguised: making money. Making money was his ideal. To make a fast buck, Felix began a journey of market making. Unluckily, he failed before he was ready for it.

‚ÄúA project was tokenized and fell on by one fifth. We were offered 200 bitcoins. Originally, we planned to spend one week pulling the price to IOP, and then double or triple it. However, when it reached IOP, bankers of private hot money¬†fixed their eyes on us. They sounded us out and found that we had no money. Finally, we were directly reshuffled.‚Äù

Felix would have earned an amount of RMB 7 million to RMB 8 million but ended up with only RMB 2 million. He lost all his individual investment. Finally, Felix realized that market making was a game for capitalists and he would never earn money through it.

After entering the market, as a result, Felix has always been engaged in operating ecological associations, which required a relatively low threshold. ‚ÄúMany associations are very active at the beginning but turn inactive after being reshuffled,‚Äù said Felix. After reshuffling, however, it required many efforts to cope with right-defending people. The major job was to pacify them.

‚ÄúI created a chat group for safeguarding legal rights and invited him to join the group. In the 500-people group, however, 400 members were my alternate accounts. When you complain, 200 members persuade you, saying that their experience is bitterer than yours. Will you still complain? When you try to jump from a building, 200 members dissuade you, noting that it is worthless. Will you still want to jump? This is very simple. But not everyone manages to do so,‚Äù said Felix.

Though operating ecological associations, Felix failed to suffer through the endless bear market. Felix, as an economic major, thought of the ‚ÄúCondom Principle‚Äù during the Great Depression, and concluded that: the only thing to do in the bear market was to consume.

He even cast accounts. Assume that he had a deposit of RMB 10 million. Based on the market condition, he would lose all or at least one half of it if he invested all the money in the market, which, comparing with spending RMB 5 million, made on difference. Therefore, when operating associations didn‚Äôt work, Felix began to organize Rendez-Vous parties.

‚ÄúBefore entering the blockchain market, I didn‚Äôt know that today‚Äôs girls were deeply in want of money. Once upon a time, I thought that they were forced to prostitute themselves,‚Äù said Felix, talking about the unexpectations after entering the blockchain market.

Eric, who underwent the same bear market, stuck to his own principles. He was quietly establishing his industrial ecology. His exchange, which was deployed in June, has successfully gone online in August.

From the perspective of industrial coverage, sound fluidity is the most distinctive feature of the blockchain market. The places where Token circulates become a major core in the blockchain industry. As a result, exchanges stand at the top of the industrial chain and hold great discourse power.

The exchange was established in the bear market and it failed to make money through major operations. Based on its industrial position, however, it could figure out other profit models. By connecting with the investment projects that Eric had not abandoned, the exchange managed to maximize the interests.

Gains

This too shall pass but what will you get after all become the things of the past?-----King Solomon

‚ÄúWe prefer upstream and core industries because it is more likely to make money in upstream.‚Äù Therefore, besides deploying exchanges, in last November, Eric began to invest in mining rigs, which produced Token‚Äîanother core of the blockchain industry (in Eric‚Äôs opinion). Starting from the industrial chain of bitcoin, mining rigs were the producers of Token.

In terms of self-orientation, Eric thought that he was building his discourse power. He felt that it was worth of striving for the blockchain because the blockchain class had not yet solidified. What he could do was to hold discourse power at certain link before solidification.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm most attracted by that kind of controlling ability and the delight resulting from being able to mobilize all things. I want to use this stuff to satisfy my self-respect.‚Äù

He thought that, currently, only two persons enjoyed the ultimate discourse power: Wu Jihan, known as ‚Äúfather of mining rig‚Äù, and Zhao Changpeng, who made the greatest achievements in exchanges. As a result, the reason why Eric made his layout in that way was not only for making money in the short run but also for more influence and discourse power in the long run. This was his ultimate goal.

In the future, Eric will concentrate on exchanges. He believed that he would provide liquidity support for this industry, making value exchange efficiency higher.

‚ÄúI will have to declare bankruptcy if I fail to make a comeback two years after the disappearance of bear market. All things should change along with the market,‚Äù Eric added, looking away and pondering for a moment, with lowered tone.

Felix, who entered the market with the hope of making money, has never estimated that the bear market would last for such a long time. He has never made any money in the market. Working with colleagues who enjoyed high basic salary and high academic qualifications in the coin community, Felix experienced the comfortable feeling beyond making money, which encouraged him to firmly believe that he would wait until that day to come.

Felix will continue his routine work, undertaking projects, chatting and making plans. He will also try Rendez-Vous parties that he has never tried before.

Failing to get a clear picture of development path, sophisticated Felix also realized that his value had changed: in the past, whether as an entrepreneur or worker, he was always told to enjoy the process and not to regret after making great efforts. Facing the reality in the blockchain industry, however, he felt that the result was more important than process. No matter what you did, success was the most important thing.

For Alan, the biggest change that the blockchain brought to him was that he would think with the business logic of blockchain when he saw anything.

For example, when queueing up for a cup of coffee, Alan would think that the membership system and points system in the coffeehouse naturally fit blockchain but the technologies were not mature enough. This situation would also inspire him‚Äîwhen can they figure out a solution.

Alan‚Äôs cooperation partners once said that he often maximized immediate interests. Unconsciously influenced by the blockchain ideas, Alan has also learnt to give priority to belief and adopt a long-term plan to secure something big and take a long-term perspective.

In addition, obvious changes have also taken place in his life. Alan usually buys fresh flowers for his wife, who then arranged flowers in vase. As time went by, scent of both fresh flowers and dried ones, lingered in the house.

He would never felt the scent in the past. At present, however, when coming back home every Saturday, he spends several minutes walking around the house and smelling the scent of flowers.

When asked what he was thinking about, he replied, ‚ÄúIt is very tranquil. I don‚Äôt think of anything because the blockchain world is too noisy.‚Äù

"With large institutional participants moving into the bitcoin space (BAKKT, Fidelity) and becoming involved in consensus mechanisms, will their love for KYC have implications for soft-forking new privacy features (Schnorr, MAST, Confidental TX's etc)?","So it seems that ""institutional investors"" meme is slowly becoming reality now. In the future, they will hold large amounts of customer funds in bitcoin, have their own nodes, media presence and hence a loud voice in the bitcoin ecosystem. They also are subject to KYC and AML.  

Given that fact, what might be the implications for future implementation of privacy enhancing technology on the bitcoin protocol, such as Schnorr, MAST, Confidental Transactions and others that I'm not aware of at the moment?  

Will we potentially have a new civil war with parts of the network wanting to have more privacy, and parts of it wanting to keep (or even enhance) the transparency of a public blockchain? How will the implementation processes look like, and will it cause friction when such large players will voice their veto against on-chain privacy?",1539946390,19/10/2018 10:53:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9pipg4/with_large_institutional_participants_moving_into/,1

Essentially they hard-forked fiat, and granted themselves the permission to ""print money"".

I'm confident Bitcoin will find accurate price discovery during fiat volatility/unstability. I can't say the same for these ""stablecoins"". Even if they are 100 percent collateralized with fiat, there's absolutely no fucking guarantee the fiat will retain its purchasing power.

Every day that goes buy, the purchasing power of your fiat buys less and less Satoshi. A statistical certainty across a long enough timeline.

Government application blockchain,"Hey guys,

I'm doing my masters in business economics this year in Belgium. So i had to choose a subject for my thesis. My subject is the applications of blockchain for governments. So i have to explore applications like voting, (intellectual property) rights, data protection/management.

So first of all i'm going to start by explaining blockchain and how the technology works and what the features and benefits of it are. Next i'll be discussing (briefly) all the various applications of blockchain that would benefit the government. Then finally, I would have to do 4 or 5 case studies of other countries that have done stuff with blockchain and see which effect this would have in Belgium. It's not an easy task but i wanted to do this because i truly believe in blockchain. I've began reading and collecting relevant articles but it's a bit overwhelming. Does anyone have any recommendations about core articles or case studies ? It would be greatly appreciated and maybe i can contribute and help bring blockchain adoption.

I emailed my Mayor,"I had an idea last night that I decided to act on, figured I should share it to open a conversation with you all.  


My city is going through a real estate boom, the cost of living is increasing faster than wages, which can be especially difficult for small businesses. My suspicion is that if a city embraces BTC and is an early adopter, by that I mean local businesses accept BTC in high levels it might attract HODLers to the area and to make purchases with BTC. Though I don't feel that the support of the local government is necessary, the idea of BTC, government and businesses working together is a great way of making BTC seem more mainstream and less dark web.  


Not sure if I'll hear back from the Mayor or not, but what I would like to do is to create a group to help companies get setup to accept BTC as a payment method.

Is there not a faster way to deposit money, convert to BTC and be able to send within 24 hours? I realize there are validation processes and appreciate the security required (esp large dollar amounts) but having to wait 7-10 days just to send BTC seems nuts.

Could someone tell me how feasible Lightning Network will work for ppl who may not be able to afford an on-chain tx fee?,"So, I guess on-chain tx fees will perhaps be more than $1 in the future w/ more adoption barring huge scaling efficiencies.

So, say you're a poor person who only makes $1 a day in some country, how can that person afford to use Bitcoin and Lightning?

I have heard of splicing and channel factories but I don't really have the technical know-how to understand how this poor person would be able to affordably use btc/lightning.

I guess this could even just apply to middle class folks making ""coffee"" purchases.  I've heard some developers say that they will need to make an on-chain tx fee every week or month to refill their lightning channel.  I've heard Lightning Labs say they can refill it on an exchange.

Fonder Diamond is not a traditional diamond company and was established as a disrupter to the diamond industry. By heavily adopting internet and mobile technology for marketing and operation, we operate at a much higher efficiency than traditional jewelers

Fonder Diamond was registered in Singapore at the beginning of 2016, engaging itself in the business of diamonds, custom-made engagement rings and wedding rings, as well as other diamond jewellery. Tracing back as early as 2014, Founder George Chen, together with Adam Pyrah has already begun the preparation of the business. Prior to Fonder Diamond, George has been involved in the trading of diamonds, especially for huge value investment-grade diamonds for many years. He noticed a change in buyer's purchasing behaviour, where most consumers would conduct their online research before visiting a jewellery shop to make their purchase ‚Äì a trend that would soon affect the age-old diamond industry. To ride this wave, George personally invested more than $2 million into Fonder Diamond whereby customers are able to access extensive information about the diamonds online before coming to our showroom and buying these diamonds at a much competitive rate. Fonder Diamond has been proven a profitable and viable business model since its first month of operation. As of March 2018, the current average annual turnover in one showroom in Singapore is around $2.5-$3 million and is projected at $4-5 million for the next year.

**Business Model of Fonder Diamond**

The diamond industry lags far behind in terms of online adoption compared to most of other retail sectors. Most consumers prefer to visit brick and mortar stores to buy diamond jewellery as the online information and selection is still lacking. Furthermore, consumers are still sceptical and concerned about the lack of customer service or the quality of diamonds when dealing with an online store. Therefore, to get the best deal, the buying process is usually time-consuming and tedious, with the consumer having to visit store after store. Although there may be a handful of branded online retailers, such as Blue Nile in US, their insufficiency lies in a lack of physical showrooms. Most consumers are not equipped with an adequate knowledge on diamonds, and are thus concerned that they might make a pricey mistake in buying diamond online. As a result, many prefer to speak to a trustable diamond and physically assess diamonds of various grades for comparison before coming to a decision.

**FONDER OPEN NETWORK (FON)**

We will actively assume the responsibility in promoting the adoption of Fonder Cryptocurrency (FON), grow the user base within the Fonder Diamond ecosystem, and later on the Fonder Open Network (FON) ecosystem. We are committed to stimulate a strong endogenous demand that benefits the adoption and liquidity of FONDER as a cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.fonder.com](https://i.redd.it/ge2mx8pax6t11.jpg)

Fonder Open Network intends to be a platform for open organisations. We believe that the most successful organisations of the future is open, and the most distinct characteristic is ‚Äúdecentralisation of ownership‚Äù. Inspired by the concept of blockchain, FON will endeavour to work out an infrastructure level protocol for open organisation, such as:

a. Ownership according to contribution

b. Influence according to merit

c. Fair reward

d. Autonomous

e. Permissive by default

**Fonder Diamond Ecosystem**

Fonder Diamond is the existing business and will serve as a launching pad for Fonder ICO, to provide ICO guarantee for diamond redeemable at the same value, as well as a strategic and vital liquidity channel. The funds raised by Fonder ICO will partially be used to expand the Fonder Diamond ecosystem in the following directions:

a. To unlock the value of high scalability of the Fonder Diamond business, we will establish showrooms in major cities around the world, through direct investments, partnership, or franchising.

b. To unlock the value of a high quality user base from Fonder Diamond‚Äôs business, we will attract the downstream industry players, such as: wedding photographers, wedding planners, and wedding designers.

c. To unlock the value of the resources on diamond supplies and custom-made jewellery manufacturers, we will build a platform to provide services to all traditional SME private jewellers

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.fonder.com](https://i.redd.it/1aorzum5x6t11.jpg)

We are unendingly amazed at the wisdom encoded in the word ‚ÄúFond‚Äù: A passion, belief or affection without reasoning. A few years ago, we started Fonder Diamond with a purpose to inspire newly engaged couples with the message of ‚ÄúLive a Fonder Life‚Äù and pass on to the generations to come. We noticed that many things in our lives that are worth believing in, to be passionate for, and to love for, but unfortunately many people give up unwillingly half way. We also observed that many people in this world say they believe in something, but from the bottom of their hearts, they are constantly reasoning, calculating, and looking for justifying reasons. As a result, instead of living a ‚ÄúFonder Life‚Äù they are in fact living a ‚Äúfond-less‚Äù life! It‚Äôs a common phenomenon for people today to have difficulty to truly believe in something which they even desire to believe in, the knack revealed from the motto ‚ÄúLive a Fonder Life‚Äù is simple and powerful. ‚ÄúStop Reasoning‚Äù, in every level of consciousness. We have watched many very successful people, nearly all have one thing in common: an unshakeable belief, passion and affection on something",1539975930,19/10/2018 19:05:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9pmvm9/fonder_open_network/,1

Financial Action Task Force Adopts Changes to Standards Covering Virtual Currencies,"&amp;#x200B;

Paris-based FATF, also known as Groupe d'action financi√®re (GAFI), is an intergovernmental organization established in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures to fight money laundering. The FATF has since developed a series of Recommendations recognized as the international standard for combating money laundering (ML) and the financing of illicit activities.

In 2015, the FATF introduced guidance on a risk-based approach to¬†digital currencies, calling all countries to take coordinated action in preventing the use of virtual currencies for crime and terrorism financing (TF).

On chain transactions are increasing but exchange volume is decreasing.,"Looking at the on chain metrics at blockchain.com we can see that on chain transactions have been increasing for the last few months, along with the blocksize.

I thought batching would put more downward pressure on the on chain transactions but they are increasing....(its especially obvious when you look at the high and higher lows on the chart.)

Yet exchange volume is decreasing, and liquid should decrease on chain transactions further and more and more batching is taking place...All of this suggests that more people are using Bitcoin and specifically using Bitcoin in ways that‚Äôs not on an exchange. Which is very bullish.

Can someone elaborate on this, and help me understand these metrics with a bit more depth please? I was sure that Coinbase batching transactions together would decrease on chain transactions to the point it would take years to start coming back up, but we can see Bitcoin is moving around more and more all summer, inverses volume to exchanges which have low volumes these days.

ELI5 please?

Reward to difficulty ratio,"@u/Frankybet : On your next puzzle, I'd recommend that you use a tactic of diminishing rewards with every clue. Start out with 0.5 BTC with nothing but the puzzle. Then after a month or two with no progress, remove 0.1BTC for every clue. Clues given by demand should not be free.

"Hey r/bitcoin! Hire me as a web developer and i will donate 20% to the cause i worked on here, last year.","Hey. Maybe some of you remember me from around this date last year, maybe none of you remember me, maybe some will remember me after [reading this](http://helpvenezuelans.com)

It was about this time last year i started that, you can read my comment history to find out more.

I am currently looking for web development freelance work, and i also have thought about helping people once again, so i have come with this idea; If you need some kind of web development work that i can do, and you hire me, i will use 20% of that money towards charity in Venezuela, that money will go towards feeding the hungry/providing medicine to those that need.

You can read more about what i can do [as a web developer here](https://np.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/9pdvhq/for_hire_30usdhour_website_developer_that_can_be/)

If you go through my comment history/that website i linked above, you'll see that last year i stopped working publicly on this cause after i received a big donation of 1 btc (was something like $15k at the time), which after some thought i ended up giving back to the original person that donated it because at the moment i didn't know how i could use such an amount of money unoticed, and i was scared of the bad people in my city that could have found out i had that. Now, that almost a year has passed i had the time to think about several different ways to do it in a safe way for anyone involved.

If you have any questions, please ask me either in the comments or through private messages, whatever you prefer!",1540032705,20/10/2018 10:51:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9pt77g/hey_rbitcoin_hire_me_as_a_web_developer_and_i/,1

* Crypto hedge funds are just like traditional hedge funds. They manage investors money, usually trade actively, and charge a management fee &amp; incentive fee.
